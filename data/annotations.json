bolts were used on the door nor were the bolts properly tightened thus causing the door to rip off the plane midflight we are talking about one case people one case but the media loves to criticize boeing whenever anything happens the company is under a magnifying glass prior to earnings this is intentional to drive the stock down at a cheaper price for big players to scoop up shares at a discount like me case 2 there are rumors that alaskan air is going to cancel its order for the 737 however that s all it isa rumor nobody in this industry actually believes that flights have already resumed normal operations and china has announced that they will be buying more boeing planes case 3 boeing has announced a safety investigation on its assembly line they have hired a top executive to lead this investigation but you have to reverseanalyze what this actually means the truth is that if boeing were expecting to report an earnings loss they would not have initiated a safety commission consider the opportunity cost of running such an investigation because they have made so much money they realize they can afford to allocate funds to this investigation even if it may seem unnecessary just to appease the media and get them off their backs case 4 wall street has not fully grasped the situation in the middle east and the rise of various proxy wars and escalation since the october 7th attacks on our ally in the middle east in fact an article has just come out stating that the militaryindustrial complex has achieved recordhigh sales and this naturally includes boeing but no everyone is focused on omg a door came off mid flight case 5 boeing s recent stock decline is driven by emotional retail investors despite widespread concerns and rumors hedge funds anticipate a significant earnings beat once this becomes evident after boeing releases its earnings report the stock is expected to rebound strongly as sellers retreat and buyers capitalize on the undervalued opportunity case 6 finally i m just going based on vibes with that being said on the offshoot that boeing goes up north of 15 i will call my local boeing office and offer to fully fund an office pizza party edit to

however this one is the first quad witching day of 2022 that did not close higher than its opening price i was able to secure a nice profit on a 0dte am spx contract this morning i really anticipated today to turn around more than it did but instead we ended up with a very bloody day and an eod shorts covering rally x200b because i like to find trends in this market i did assess to see if there was an correlation with the monday following quad witching day and there really is not two of the three quad days closed green for a 667 probability that monday closes green one opened big green one opened big red and one opened flat so there really is no telling what mondays opening will bring but we could expect a green close x200b yesterday i mentioned that today felt oddly similar to the september leading quad witching time period interestingly enough from the peak of monday september 12th till the bottom of friday september 16th quad witching day we had about a 72 drop from tuesday december 13th cpi day to today friday december 16th quad witching day we had about a 72 drop from high to low in price action if we look at the monday following septembers quad day we saw a nice deep red open at 09 however spy rallied to close at 078 the biggest difference here is that the week following quad witching was cpi week does that mean we see a red open and a rally or without fomc and really no big news events after a massive 72 drop from the opening on cpi day to the lowest part of today are we finally going to see a bounce well if we take a look at the daily candle while hard to see cause of the black trend line it is actually a dragonfly doji candle which in a down trend should signal a short term bottom in addition unless spy was to open at 3779 15 or lower on monday that black 4 day drop resistance line will be broken at open this should open up the upside for spy now a taking a look at the last few days here a 15 red open doesn t sound that crazy but after 4 pretty impressive days of straight selling i would be slightly surprised to see a 5th day of selling with no relief bounce this sell off today also filled the almost month long gap at 38114 from november cpi we now have a gap to the upside from 38658 to 38789 and 39525 to 39631 while i would have suspect a bigger break down to test a stronger more established support at 380 intraday today we put in almost 25 hours of price action bouncing on around the 381 area this area established itself as strong support x200b now taking a look at the weekly chart here things are kind of a mixed bag from an interesting data stand point todays total high to low range was $2945 which makes it 2nd largest high to low range of the year next to the week of september 12th which was $2962 if you remember above i mentioned that also was the last quad witching week so the question now remains is this the short term top or did we just reconfirm support on the daily chart i mentioned that i suspected after that impressive 4 days straight of selling for a total 72 high to low drop that we should be do for some sort of relief bounce now on the weekly we have an interesting case here on one hand we did very clearly break through that 2022 bear market resistance line that s the dark thicker green line on the daily and weekly so that should signal that we are going to see a more meaningful push higher however as you can see on this daily candle there was a massive wick and we closed out an impressively large gravestone doji i said for the last two weeks and especially after fomc that until we broke the rising wedge and lost 3901 on the daily channel i was not bearish well we officially lost the rising wedge and lost 3901 losing those signaled to me that we should see a break down to that key support area of 370 to 380 which we hit today when we touched 381 however this gravestone doji on a down trend that last 3 weekly candles have made a lower low actually could signal a short term bottom and a bounce for next week i see two scenarios well maybe three the first scenario is that 381 was our local bottom and we go back to test resistance if we test 3901 which is a major daily and weekly resistance and break through then most likely we are looking at a gap fill up in the mid 390s there is a scenario where we could see another test of that 4052 to 410 area however i do not think we see that big of a breakout the second part of this scenario is that we retest 3901 resistance reconfirm it as resistance and then start our breakdown into the 370s next week the second scenario is that 41049 was the official top of this cycle and we are starting our next leg down much like the structure of the september to october breakdown if this is the start of the next leg down then i would be eye by eoy to middle of january a breakdown to the 358 to 364 support area i feel conflicted here the cpi we got this week was surprisingly very bullish and a very good reading it does show at least short term that inflation has peaked and that inflation is slowly coming down however of course it would be extremely improbable that we see a nonstop drop in inflation to the 2 target without any sort of stickiness or meaningful rebound in cpi we had fomc on wednesday which while i wouldn t say this was the most hawkish that jpow has ever been we did get a big of news in the markets that was unexpected however yesterday and today it was said that the markets already were not believing the fed and were revising their targets to the prefomc numbers i thought i had a tweet for this but i cant find it my thesis personally is that we will revisit 3901 resistance before the next leg down however if we were to come down and touch 378 support and hold that that odds of a bounce back to the 390s before a bigger sell off increases after pretty much a month of consolidating in the 390 to 405 range though this could be spy choosing a direction and the start of the next leg down this market for the last month has been so indecisive its really hard to give a concrete yes or no if you look at december 1st and december 13th those were two fake breakouts from the 390 to 405 channel only to fall right back into them while november 17th did touch support right at 3901 we have not had a fake breakdown out of the channel yet x200b remarkably the futures bear channel from that last 4 days doesn t look as impressive as spys does we did see es lose that critical 3910 pivot area but it managed to find support at 3875 next major support is 3835 and then 3805 x200b taking a look at the futures weekly chart here you can see we did finally break that weekly bull channel that dates back to cpi that really should open the downside however we obviously also wicked through the 2022 bear market resistance line too this is where it s a matter of which move is coming next this market just gives us more questions than it gives us answers now a days the once interesting thing though is that futures did bounce right off the 3870 area which is the call side of the jpm collar which expires on december 30th now the last two quarterlies we have seen us breakout over the call side of the collar and by quarterly options expiration we are sitting just above the put which is at 3425 now again history does not predict the future but that is the historical trend for the last two quarterlies this market just leaves us with more and more questions rather than answers unfortunately x200b now taking a look at tesla this is an interesting one today tesla actually despite spys pretty red open was green and more interesting than that today i noted that the overall sell pressure on spy was 23x higher than the sell pressure on tech and nyse today made me wonder if we were seeing a rotation outta spy for some reason and really this whole week i remember thursday it was the same thing that spy outta the gate led the sell off and then by mid morning afternoon tech nyse had joined in an accelerated the sell off now tesla has a ton of patterns going here on the daily we have the wider broad black falling wedge and within that falling wedge we have a red semi narrow bear channel tesla is also well below its daily 8 and daily 20ema x200b taking a look at the tesla sell buy cycles we are currently at our 11th day of the sell off and 246 drop from peak to current low that means of the average length of sell off we are nearly 2x that and we are 46 more than the average sell off cycle length drop the red bear channel and black falling wedge says monday support would be at 144 black falling wedge and 142 red bear channel if we were to see continued selling that would put tesla at day 12 of selling and 27 to 29 from peak to projected trough that would put it right at the longest length and drop of the cycle now if we believe in this being the local bottom we could be looking at about a 4 day 1404 rally that would put us by thursday at 175 x200b tesla however today hit a major support area when it touched 150 this 150 support area is exactly where the red falling wedge with its now 3rd touch and blue falling wedge also its 3rd touch both intersected each other also if we flip back to august 2020 to november 2020 the 150 area was a major resistance that took nearly 3 months for tesla to break through if there is an area that tesla is going to see a meaningful bounce off of its here weekly support 150 148 red falling wedge 145 blue falling wedge 1292 weekly resistance 1689 blue falling wedge weekly 8ema 1757 195 i am long on some 28dte 160c for tesla and i do expect tesla to minimally retest 175 by beginning to middle of next week x200b the vix is again back to being detached from reality which someone made a great point today that until cboe reconfigures how it calculates the vix with the newly introduced 0dte everyday on spy qqq and the overall increase in options being trades short term the vix is most likely going to stay detached from reality and completely useless however the biggest thing i am seeing is that we for the 3rd day in a row despite this huge spy sell off have rejected 237 breakout area until we see vix close back over that 237 and hold that area i really struggle to be bearish on spy also while i understand we had cpi and fomc during this 4 days dump on spy the vix despite a 72 drop on spy closed lower than it did 4 days ago which on most meaningful dumps on spy you should see the vix continue to close higher and higher this is another reason why i feel that we get a meaningful bounce next week because the vix is not ramping up like it did at the previous local bear market rally tops however if spy continues to drop and the vix breaks out over 237 and holds then i might actually believe that the bear market rally is over and that we could be starting our descent to 320 by spring 2023 daily log today was a tough day technical to trade for most of the day through the middle of the day we had spy looking like it wanted to rally which it ended up doing eod however we watched vold just continue to dump hard and harder every time however despite all that i was able to put in a nice green day today i actually looking back had a pretty great week x200b honestly desite how much i enjoy trading and following tesla i continue to somewhat struggle doing so granted this was a high volatile week with cpi fomc and quad witching looking at my weekly recap i had a great week of scalping again putting in a 100 win rate on strictly scalps level to level trading on spy resulted in my highest win rate since ive started tracking my l2l plays in beginning of october the profits were mild though which i mostly relate to the overall smaller daily ranges we are having which result in lower take profits previously 1015 on scalps and l2ls were easily obtained but now taking profits at 35 is about the happy spot before we see theta eat or a rogue reversal as i mentioned struggled on tesla this week so still keeping that in mind going forward on whether i just permenatly rotate it out of the lineup despite how much i enjoy it swing trade wise i took a huge loss this week mostly because i didn t close at 0dte swing on monday at open had i closed that at open i would have had a breakeven to red week when it comes to swings i did a power hour straddle this week which netted some great profits most days this week i believe netted profits for that and that s something i will continue to evaluate going forward fomc cpi lottos ended up netting me some green this week overall a great week of profits and a great week of trading despite the volatility and wildness with 3 big events in one week i am heading out of town for some family time for christmas and will not be trading monday tuesday or wednesday i really wanna disconnect from stuff and enjoy some time uniterrupted by trading with my family however depending what our plans are i may try to shoot out a pre market update and i may attempt to trade the opening hour just going to play that by ear i am swining a 7dte 384c on spy that i plan to close if we get a decent green open on monday otherwise i will just let it ride for the week i am also holding a 28dte 160c on tesla that is down 30 at open as long as i see 1605 64 by friday i will be able to close that green i will most likely unless we see signs of an extremely strong rally close both of those at 1020 profits if they present themselves if i also see things going really bad really fast i will just cut my losses and sit cash until im back trading full time on thursday enjoy your weekend guys and i will see you guys back on

forecasted 25 basis point rate hike let s think about why the fed started bailing out banks and even opened the floodgates but people kept taking money out of banks a dozen banks on wall street started bailing out first republic bank but last night first republic bank s stock price still fell nearly 50 ubs sold itself to ubs at a 4 valuation but ubs s acquisition was not as painful as these events what is the reason behind this one is that the fed said in 2021 that inflation was only temporary and then inflation suddenly became the biggest problem in front of people all over the world so in 2022 there was the strongest wave of interest rate hikes in history and global financial markets fell through their pants and if we want accountability it was actually the fed s error in judgment but we bore the consequences so we don t trust the fed from powell s point of view he definitely wants to raise interest rates after all the fight against inflation is his main task but now the banking crisis the biden administration and other countries in the world that have a lot of us debt the pressure of debt to powell is infinite which is the reason there is a choice to stop raising interest rates but i think tomorrow night will still raise rates as usual 25 basis points the reason is that the bank of england also did so raise rates qe will also another point is that if march does not raise rates inflation really can not hold april is no rate hike resolution can only wait until may to add so the risk is greater so this time to add 25 even if after the market panic the fed can also use other means to appease the market the big deal is to say in advance of the may rate cut chant so think about the fact that it is not so the market will be in a state of panic this is my

is held by insiders and it s thinly traded what s interesting about the company is an announcement they made on 1214 which effectivley amounts forcing small shareholders to sell specifically they announced a 1 for 12 500 reverse spilt followed immediately by a 12 500 for 1 forward split this is scheduled to take place on 182024 according to their press release of the announcement no fractional units will be issued in connection with the reverseforward unit split instead the company will pay cash without interest to any unitholder who would be entitled to receive a fractional unit as a result of the reverseforward unit split unitholders who hold fewer than 12 500 units immediately prior to the reverse unit split will be paid in cash without interest an amount equal to such number of company common units held multiplied by volumeweighted average price for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the reverseforward unit split in other words if you own fewer than 12 500 you will be forced out of the stock the publicly available float will decrease in aggregate by the total amount of shares held by shareholders owning under 12 500 shares and well good luck getting back in following the forward split as the pice will in all likelihood be higher due to the reduced share count and lack of available shares to buy since the shares are very thinly traded there s a possiblity of this stock moving higher leading up to the split shareholders just under the 12 500 mark will want to increase their holdings above the threshold to avoid being taken out and since shareholders who have no intention of rising above the level will be taken out anyway they ll likely just wait for the split to be paid out rather than selling before it aside from the interesting techinical setup this is an extremely hostile corporate action directed at small shareholders if the company wants to take them out they should offer a fair

right now made in mexico with cheaper nonunionized labor usage of large pouchstyle batteries which are cheaper but lowerquality a more batteryefficient car formfactor as compared to a truck meaning less batteries for a desired range and therefore lower cost of production if ford is unprofitable with a highpriced ev benefiting from $7 500 made in mexico with lower priced components how are they going to be profitable with the f150 lightning the f150 lightning will be made by union labor at us labor prices have a lessefficient form factor truck aerodynamics are very bad have higher user

razorthin profit margins or none at all over the near future additionally ford has additional issues it has to tackle growing percentages of ev sales will reduce dealership income most of which is derived from maintenance and repair leading to more pervasive markups a need to develop a supercharging network look more deeply into their published numbersif you nix tesla s superchargers which they can access rn as tesla will jack up prices for nontesla s over time especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened and eliminate lowpower chargers look closely in your area at the actual number of high power charging stations individually there may be chargepoint nodes in your area but at least in atlanta the total stalls are very low battery supply shortages higher prices for batteries this is why fords ceo has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production so what 1 ford has to raise pricesthey have no other choice 1 none of the subbullets above dealership cut need for expanded charger network declining subsidy $ higher priced us labor higher priced batteries with lessefficient form factors is easily solvable while ford talks about separating evs from its dealership network that legal fight will take years 2 this same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 3 legacy auto debt levels looking at ford and vw in particular mean they can t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit 4 therefore legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices 5 tesla is therefore insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition add to this several teslaphenomena 1 tesla s cost of production will continue to decline meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 1 technology reasons dimecasting structural battery and 4680 if it continues to scale batteries 2 economies of scale reasons tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories 50 cagr can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone per year i would doubt these projections if it wasn t for tesla s record setting cagrwhich has surprised the entire industry over the past three years 2 therefore because tesla has more buffer to decrease pricesin an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future conclusion tesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future while some legacy auto vw might produce evs in large numbers this will not

actually a phenomenal deal some comments on the merger agmt i know there are a billion posts on here about $twtr but i don t think there s enough discussion of the actual merger agreement which to me shows that twitter is a great deal first the disclaimer this is not investment advice or legal advice i am obviously retarded and if you listen to me so are you some background much of this you probably know elon musk is buying at $5420 a share current price is below $49 and buying at $49 makes you a more than 10 return on your capital assuming the deal doesn t fall through the risk of the deal falling through is why twitter isn t trading at exactly $5420 right now in addition to the risk of having capital tied up we can see the merger agreement now it s technically a merger for reasons that don t matter but realistically elon is buying the company so pretend it s just an acquisition actually reviewing the agreement reveals the upside the closing is supposed to occur by october so capital invested should be tied up for less than six months there are seven basic ways this agreement can fall apart 1 elon and twitter both agree to go separate ways 2 elon materially breaches his obligations and twitter decides to terminate 3 twitter materially breaches its obligations and elon decides to terminate 4 twitter gets a better offer and takes it 5 some government agency holds up the deal 6 the shareholders reject the deal 7 it s just impossible to get the deal done and it s really nobody s fault but it took way too long if a party is at fault for the deal falling apart it generally speaking has to pay the other a billion dollars twitter s obligations under this agreement are very pedestrian for a $44 billion deal i ve seen single digit million dollar real estate refinancing deals that are more cumbersome so out of the ways this deal can fall apart we can basically rule out all but one twitter is not going to get a better offer and if they did that would be good not bad since we d get a better return on the investment twitter is not going to back out of the deal the board already agreed to it which was almost certainly based on discussion with big shareholders they ve also clearly decided this is best for the company and the idea that they would intentionally back out now makes no sense twitter also isn t going to screw this up their obligations under the deal are too minimal and the idea that they make the deal fall apart is very unlikely relatedly a government agency is not going to block the deal and it s not going to be impossible for this deal to be completed nothing is certain in life but those two things are about as close to certain as it gets so we re left with basically one way this deal falls apart which is that elon screws it up right now there are tons of stories out there saying oh elon already breached the deal which are making investors more skeptical that skepticism makes little sense first off elon s tweets do not breach the agreement if you read the words and think carefully about what he tweeted you ll see that the reporters who say otherwise are being sloppy and even if elon were tweeting in violation of the agreement it s not realistic to think twitter would actually back out of the deal on that basis are they going to pass on the deal of a lifetime because elon said mean things about them no so the deal can fall apart either because elon changes his mind or somehow isn t able to get financing elon clearly isn t too worried about making sure i s are dotted and t s are crossed because he s agreed to this merger agreement that is pretty easy for twitter to me this shows that he really wants to own twitter although people talk about scenarios where he uses a deal falling apart to turn a profit that makes no sense if elon backs out there is absolutely no way he makes money he can t just sell twitter for a profit right now without making sec filings which would tank the stock and even if he could based on his basis and the current trading value he would lose money when you re factoring in the $1 billion divorce fee while his financing could fall through it would require a lack of creativity on his part he has enough leveragable assets that he can find a way to buy twitter even if tesla poofed out of existence which obviously won t happen elon s spacex value alone is more than $50 billion as i said above you can see from the way the merger agreement is drafted that he wants twitter so while there are reasons to be concerned elon will mess up or back out they aren t really good reasons lastly if elon backs out he pays twitter $1 billion which is roughly 50 of twitter s cash on hand and would represent nearly 10 of their assets by book value $1 billion may not be a lot of money for elon but it actually is for twitter that s a massive cash infusion which will help the company so the downside is somewhat limited because even in a scenario where elon backs out twitter s financials suddenly look materially better so there you go it s a really good deal the potential downside is limited while the deal can fall through it s not very likely oh also did you hear that the economy unexpectedly shrunk last quarter do you have a better strategy to make 10 in six months during a

recap 5323 sell the news the fed so the fed show was pretty good today i think both bulls and bears are happy to come out of that statement here are a few notes from me 1 inflationdriven as always the fed s decision will be based on inflation data which will make the market keep jittering over the upcoming cpi and economic reports inflation is still the number one priority make no mistake the fed won t stop until inflation is under control economic growth employment etc are all going to take a back seat 2 confidence in the economy maybe even optimistic about a soft landing a shallow recession is probably still their base case but i think jp personally likes what he saw in the economic data so far it s not too hot not too cold consumers are doing okay and the job market is still strong while inflation is heading towards the right direction 3 concerns over credit tightening the concern is real as he mentioned quite a few times in the statement but obviously not bad enough to pause the sloos report on may 8th should shed some light on that topic adp data beat estimates by a mile this morning but if you break it down it was quite interesting overall payroll was much higher than the estimate however manufacturing was down big time 38k wage growth also cooled down for both job stayers and job leavers which is great news for disinflation as adp s chief economist nela richardson put it the slowdown in pay growth gives the clearest signal of what s going on in the labor market right now employers are hiring aggressively while holding pay gains in check as workers come off the sidelines our data also shows fewer people are switching jobs the data pretty much confirmed what s been showing in other economic reports manufacturing contracting while service is still booming and job market tightness seems to be improving on liquidity treasury is thinking about issuing $1 trillion in bills over the next six months provided debt ceiling resolution meanwhile the fed is shrinking its balance sheet by about $95 billion per month less than $600 billion over the next six months so overall we have a net $400 billion of liquidity introduced into the system i mentioned this on monday it makes no sense i think we are at the end of qt already liquidity is only going to go up from here and nonstop qe will continue in perpetuity the economy crude oil was down another 5 today

commodity index as a whole is quickly approaching march lows and has already given up all gains since 2022 it s good news for disinflation but it makes one wonder if we are heading towards a global recession even after adjusting for seasonality effects and differing numbers of working days in a given month global trade volumes dropped further in march to the lowest levels since 2020 on an adjusted basis and well below trend interesting charts from barclays on how vix lags cds in response to the debt ceiling crisis in 2011 and how wide the gap is today i think vix may have reached a bottom as the fed left more doubt than answers today with earnings season coming to an end and the fed pause not happening the market needs to face a lot of uncertainties this month like the debt ceiling regional banks more economic and inflation data etc and a lot has not been priced into the stock market yet more data on the consumers boa q1 data confirmed household savings are still high

their accounts from robinhood s website as of 242023 robinhood financial charges a standard margin interest rate of 1125 and a margin interest rate of 725 for customers who subscribe to gold the margin interest rate is calculated by adding 65 for nongold customers or 25 for gold customers to the upper bound of the target federal funds rate which is set by the federal reserve and is subject to change without notice hood margin what s important here is that robinhood is giving non gold members margin at a steep price while incentivizing users to move to gold $5month for more favorable terms

started with robinhood increasing assets and increasing revenues the market snp 500 was down over 2022 this may have caused retail investors to be locked into their losing positions if an investor were to have purchased the security on margin they were forced to hold or sell at a loss selling the losing position and likely entering into a new position generates payment for order flow revenue

profit margin is negative 4 if your supply pool wants to leave you news article you will only lose more 5 there are more articles who find justeat an absolute knife on throat business and stress restaurant owners which is already a very stressful job many restaurants don t survive it s difficult 6 yet the firm is valued at 35bn has a share price of over 10 euro s so if you ask me is the financial market making sense no is this firm dead yes why is it kept alive debt is a lovely tool i have frequently shorted justeat on heavy derivatives from time to time and will do so until this despicable company i ve walked into restaurants where they utterly complained about barely surviving in this economy and justeat isn t making it easier i ve got a friend who runs a restaurant but not takeaway and this hits me on every angle for every justeat i can grab another company in any other domain which technically is dead yet their directors are earnings excess money the average joe barely earns anything at all this isn t a cherrypicked example in the uk you have deliveroo uber does ubereat or something but i can also pick completely other firms which are dead yet have market value of billions billions of hot airs i trade just eat constantly i have an utter hatred for this firm but have done my due dilligence i trade them constantly in a simple dumb algorithm which i used to build when i was a banker as i started my career in banking a long time ago as a banker the stock market is not a reflection of the economy or the participants in this economy that suffers and i have no feeling at all that this ever will end well i have met so many suffering stories from restaurant owners who suffer under the reigns of this firm that i am seriously considering legal action to me this is a dead firm and will die slowly but surely they have various daughter entities they might sell for liquidity that will be a spike so my advice is go for a vol box when you hear the news this firm shows that is has value but there is no accounting nor mathematical evidence that this is the case feel free to plunder and booty",{"entities":[[61,81,"ORG"],[94,105,"ORG"],[268,279,"ORG"],[1706,1713,"ORG"],[1855,1862,"ORG"]]}],["my picks for 2022823 remember to trade responsibly these are all probabilities after all not

startling when you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real layoffs hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion people are pessimistic about housing purchases gas prices and energy costs to name a few the thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers if people feel that everything is more expensive they may feel poorer and spend less as a result even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems it can become a self fulfilling prophecy and then there are the financial markets

highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle with the fed beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet unlike prepandemic there still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall the reason that these issues aren t going to go away anytime soon is due to my new favorite term excessive savings this term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range it s funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem on the one hand it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power on the other hand this excess cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back that may take awhile to add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down how much leverage

we will see a rate cut by december 2023 someone screenshot this prediction any rate cuts will increase the interest rate spreads how banks and mreits make money so obviously the financial sector should see a significant price movement to the upside but this isn t the most exciting catalyst the most exciting catalyst is all the prospective homebuyers that have been sitting on cash just like mm waiting for interest rates to get cut to hop in my bet is loanorigination will explode all mreits should go to the upside as soon as a rate cut is announced but the most parabolic price action will be the earnings releases of q3 2024 after the sellingbuying season boom x200b now here s why i picked ivr ivr is managed by invesco one of the largest investment firms in the world so it has strength and a knowledgeable hopefully team behind it x200b my prediction is ivr is about to be profitable by release of q3 2023 results screenshot this too lol it s earnings and revenue have been increasing qoq the trend is your friend see the 2 earnings and revenue growth pictures the last 3 earnings have beat analyst expectations and eps has been rocketing to the upside q1 q2 eps for q1 2023 eps for q2 2023 notice the parabolic movement up x200b the ps ratio is currently sitting at 161 which is a little inflated but easy to look past if you have been paying attention to the eps growth and free cash flow growth x200b the pb ratio of 059 is right on par with where i think this should be it s a big green buy sign x200b analysts also expect its earnings and revenue to explode in the coming year

what else is a fortress a citadel so that s our starting point let s look at major news involving the two citadel poaches python developer from jp morgan mcguire spent the past eighteen and a half years at jpmorgan where he was most recently an executive director in quantitative research on the bank s athena team athena is jpmorgan s risk and pricing engine which is coded in python at citadel mcguire will be a quantitative software engineer based in new york city recruiters say the big demand now is for quants who are python experts hedge funds like citadel need python developes to work on software that can back test trading strategies so citadel picks up this guy to backtest new trade strategies end of 2021 this year in a month s time will be the end of the bull run as the market slides into bear territory who gets obliterated through 2022 just about every ipo since 2020 see citadel came to prominence over hft and trade confirmation technology they definitely do not take advantage of pfof to front run customers through any trading apps let s take a peek at one of those trading apps just a random one timely news so here s my belief citadel gets reamed on their trades early 2021 by retail surge they have to bail out their own plotkin and such they re pissed and want to make up their balance sheet and then some they poach this guy to develop a more aggressive strategy perhaps tapping deeper into contract premiums and hedging those contracts with traditional stocks bought and sold in no particular order mind you adhering to t2 i bet it works great revenue pours in and citadel makes something like 18 billion in profit through the very bearish 2022 tons generated from retailbought options on startups and everything else that fall flat through the year
