is their any reason why i shouldnt take a bank loan to short banks currently so giving the fact that the fractional reserve banking seems to favor shorts giving system failure why should i not take the biggest loan i can get from a bank that has high exposure to svb only thing i can see is things turn around but thats pretty much impossible even if it was a short term play an say put it in for a week or two an then pull it out an return it in full if all of a sudden good news after good news comes out but on the flip side keep what i make in the first month in profit an return it back or best case the bank i took it from goes under an dont pay it back at all im sure some people may have done this already so i figure if more keep doing it things will only ramp up thoughts

i figured out the secret to trading options i tested it out and it works regardless of the current market or the stock you choose you can just look at the 5 day trend and make money over time about half of the time you ll lose money but over time you ll gain more than you lose you see i m extremely smart some might even say i m a genius before i started daytrading i was a professional online poker player from all my study of poker and analyzing the game that s also given me a unique edge here i started looking at 100 s of different stocks and just choosing random weeks and looking at their graphs then i put them into 16 categories being up up up up up up up down up up down up and so on after i had a big enough sample size i just averaged the result from the fifth day lo and behold you get a predictable pattern for example if a stock goes up four days in a row it goes down almost 100 of the time on the fifth although i had a small sample size for that and i forgot how to calculate the margin of error i just know it s e something anyway so yeah the angel the stock moves is also important mainly just for the third and fourth day i found so it s pretty simple just look at the 5 day moving average choose an appropriate option and you ll make more money on average than you lose as it turns out it s almost always the option 1 or 2 below the current price so if the stock is 100 dollars i d probably be going for the 95 or 90 call option it s mainly because it s like this if you buy a 1 dollar contract and if the stock goes up a dollar it will be worth 2 dollars and if it goes down 1 dollar it will be worth 70 cents you either make 100 or lose 30 set your stop points once you find a good contract and you should win about half of the time the reason this only works half of the time is because of natural variation you can t predict exactly what 1 000 000 people will do but you can predict what 1 000 000 people on average do if it s not half of the time you re setting the stop loss too high or the sell point too low and you optimize the average return when it s 5050 a lot of people buy bad contracts and just hope the market heads in a direction don t unless you re going to be holding onto it for months i never hold onto anything for longer than a day personally
when is nissan going to announce their ev pickup so it s going to happen and we all know what happens when an automaker announces an ev pickup the reason i suspect it s soon is because just a few weeks ago nissan announced they d be discontinuing the titan and retooling the factory for evs in 2024 nissan isn t rolling in cash like the other automakers they started getting kicked hard before covid kept getting kicked during covid and never popped back up so they re not going to retool any more than they have to they ve been making ev pickups in asia and trucks make the money in the states is it going to be announced at chicago in february next year new york in march or detroit in september could be an option for 12 month or 18 month leaps depending on the answer stock is trending up regardless and will continue down 50 in the 5 year but up 30 in 1 year charts they still have a lot of ground to recover
day trading options it works for me i always pick one of the big etfs like qqq or spy mostly qqq which seems to be more volatile these days when the rsi for one day and five days goes below 30 oversold i buy deep in the money calls at least a couple months out they carry almost no premium 100 contracts gives you the control of 10 000 qqqs good bet is august 18 $320 calls when the rsi for one day and five days marked them in red top left corner goes above 70 overbought i buy deep in the money puts again at least a couple months out for now i trade august 18 $380 puts when i plan to buy 100 contracts i go in 2030 contracts at the time for every 100 contracts a 50 cents move brings me $5k of course you can play with 10 contracts or 1000 up to you x200b the rsi for one and five days seems to be a consistent method with big etfs the rsi i use is 14 days range x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b

fed minutes to detail debate over rate hike endgame minutes from the us federal reserve s latest meeting out wednesday are expected to detail the breadth of debate at the central bank over how much further interest rates may need to be raised to slow inflation and cool an economy that has remained stronger than expected despite tighter fed policy the twoday meeting ended on feb 1 with the central bank raising its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point a return to a more standard rate hike size after a year of sequential threequarter point and halfpoint increases in a press conference following that meeting fed chair jerome powell said the return to smaller rate hikes was meant to allow a more stepwise hunt for a possible stopping point and that officials spent the session talking quite a bit about the path forward as the central bank nears what may be the end of its hiking cycle but that session was also held before key data releases that showed unusually strong job gains in january and showed less of a slowdown in inflation than anticipated a trend expected to continue this week with the release friday of a report on how the fed s preferred inflation index fared in january the fed uses the personal consumption expenditures price index in setting its 2 inflation target economists polled by reuters estimate it improved only modestly in january falling on an annual basis from 44 to 43 once the more volatile food and energy components are excluded that core inflation measure is seen actually increasing on a monthtomonth basis to 04 from 03 since the meeting some fed officials have acknowledged they had pushed to continue with larger halfpoint rate increases at the last meeting while investors have boosted their own outlook for where the fed may end up most do not see the fed returning to larger halfpoint increases now that they have slowed but they do see the fed moving rates higher than previously anticipated and leaving them at an elevated level for longer as well a change in sentiment likely welcomed by fed officials concerned market pricing had understated their resolve in bringing inflation back to the 2 target the minutes to be released at 2 pm et 1900 gmt may show just how tilted toward hawkish policy the fed remains particularly at a meeting that proved to be the last for former vice chair lael brainard who was among the fed s most sensitive to the risks facing the economy under tight monetary policy and the most detailed in sketching out reasons for why inflation might slow faster than expected brainard who left the fed to head president joe biden s national economic council embodied one aspect of a discussion between those who advise caution in further rate hikes because the economy still has not fully adjusted to what the fed has done to date and those who feel businesses and households are proving more resilient than expected to rising interest rates and may need the restraint of even higher interest rates for inflation to fully regress while there was little disagreement last year over what the fed needed to do as inflation raced to a 40year high the central bank is now in a more twosided discussion to find out to what extent the resilience of the economy thus far reflects time lags on monetary tightening versus a higher short term neutral rate needed to cause businesses and households to slow spending analysts for isi evercore wrote in an analysis ahead of the minutes while the minutes released today are particularly dated given the jobs and inflation numbers released since then policymakers will update their views next month with new economic and interest rate projections issued after the fed s march 2122 meeting source the fed minutes from its latest meeting is set to be released today wherein it is expected to detail the the next interest rate hikes or might give clues on when the fed will cut hikes how do you think the stocks will react following the release of the fed minutes later

bullish case for growth stocks growth stocks have been hammered this year because of the prospect of higher interest rates using the future discounted cashflows valuation higher interest rates mean higher discount rates in the denominator of the cashflows and lower valuations however higher inflation increases the multiplers of the cashflows and the valuations what matters is the annual difference between inflation and interest rates the higher the difference the higher the valuation another factor is that companies may have lower returns in the next couple of years due to a recession which lowers their valuation my point is growth stocks don t need to worry as much about lower short term returns their short term returns were going to be small anyways compared to their long term returns no need to worry about interest rates much either they are still well below the inflation rate and the fed can t increase rates too much for too long because that will crash the economy and make national debt unsustainable if they crash the economy they will have to lower rates again and keep doing more qe lol on the other hand we can t control inflation as much there s currently a trend towards reversing globalization which will increase prices no matter what interest rates are this will decrease the revenue of many companies buyingselling goods internationally however a lot of growth stocks sell services internationally mostly software communications and entertainment they aren t affected by commodities as much higher inflation means higher returns for these companies over the long run which should increase their valuation plus many these companies have already fallen more than 3040 as soon as the markets start to see that interest rates don t go up so much and that inflation is still kind of high the dollar will plummet and growth stocks will go to the moon
canoo can go to the moon canoo under the code goev has already received an order for 4 500 electric vehicles from wall mart and an option for another 10 000 vehicles both the initial and subsequent orders are valid on the condition that the company is able to set up the required production line the estimate for the cost of this line is about $2 billion at the same time wall mart has signed up to exercise options at $22 wall mart has nothing to lose only to gain from this deal we re going to canoo under the code goev before it signed with wall mart it had nothing in its possession to help it implement its plans now it had an agreement with wall mart is it reaching maybe it will but certainly if she can t build a production line with that agreement in her hands she will reasonably never be able to of course everyone has shorted the stock on the basis the company will be forced to issue new shares to get the cash it needs it seems a very easy bet for those who have shorted let me start with a few questions to provide food for thought 1 how often has the vast majority fallen in on its stock market bets 2 more than 36 million shares are already short and the average volume for the twelve months is about 4 million shares per day i have the feeling that if the stock goes over $5 everyone will look to close positions and the door will be very narrow and the stock will probably post high double digits in consequence what do you believe 3 why would wall mart waste time and sign with canoo and not sign with a company that already has a production line 4 after the announcement of the wall mart deal the share price moved from $25 to $5 and after making a double peak at exactly $5 the stock is now at $37 before the announcement of the deal the short positions in the stock were 34 million shares after the announcement the positions jumped to 365 million shares so everyone is so confident that the new shares will have a strike price below $35 that they will push the stock down with the announcement if the stock is currently worth about $1 billion that has nothing in its hands but plans will it be worth just $3 billion if it finds the $2 billion it s looking for x200b

update nio puts a bad idea earlier this week i opened a position of 800 $7p expiring this friday i closed this position today at a 7 loss i think nio s recent massive sales misses have already largely been priced in the ceo will give some stupid reasoning why they are only marginally lowering guidance instead of significantly and they ll pump the supposed preorders of the new es6 model which is being released in twoish weeks the stock won t drop significantly if at all i would ve needed like a 12 plus drop in share price to make any money with those puts and i just think the price has been beaten down too much already market macro sentiment is too high as well anybody still playing nio puts at earnings good luck the stock seems like a dumpster fire lately and logic makes you think nio has further to fall but i just think too much bad news has already been priced in and iv is too high i just don t see how nio falls at all knowing the ceo is going to tout the es6 preorders when a play seems too logical best to avoid

are we currently or about to exit a massive bull trap similar to the one that happened middotcom bubble deets in text below i was looking at historical data weektoweek on yahoo finance for the nasdaq from dec 00 dec 03 during the dotcom bubble and here s a quick synopsis of what i saw and it made me think about where we are today the nasdaq hits its ath at 2936 during the week of dec 11th 00 it hits its initial bottom during the week of sep 24th 01 at 1459a roughly 50 drop from the prior peak 2936 x 05 but then rallies over the next several months via a massive bull trap until it hits another peak of 2075 during the week of jan 7th 02 this represents a roughly 40 rally 14 x 1459 the second real bottom occurs during the week of oct 7th 02 when the nasdaq closes at 1135a roughly 60 total loss from the initial ath of 2936 during the end of 00 2936 x 04 the 40 rally between bottoms was a massive bull trap that wiped a lot of people out who got fomo and thought the market was recovering from the initial crash of sep 01 the nasdaq didn t get back to the 2900 s until february of 2012 well after the gfc of 07 08 the pattern could play out similarly with the current market cycle with respect to the first crash happening in oct of 22 after markets hit aths at the end of 21 then a bull trap going into the first half of 2023 off of the back of ai hype and then a 2nd harder crash kicking in sometime either in the 2nd half of this year or the first half of next year am i crazy to think that this recession cycle could be playing out very similarly to the 20002003 recession cycle

buy penn i bought shares of penn entertainment ticker penn this morning penn shares are down 27 year to date on declining free cash flow despite growing profits ebitda as they are still a growing company and are investing in the business speaking of investments penn s recentpartnership with barstool sports expired and they replaced it with a partnership with espn and they are now calling their online sports book app espn bet espn is a much bigger platform than barstool massively expanding penn s reach penn s online sports betting app currently has 10 market share in the highly fragmented north american online gaming market and theironline casino app has an 8market share with a combined 27mm users espn streaming service currently has 25mm subscribers and espn s fantasy gambling app has 11mm unique users under the agreement espn will exclusively reference espn bet on all of its broadcasts using espn bet s lines and promoting the app this should attract users to espn bet penn management is predicting a doubling of market share in both sports and casino apps within 3 years projecting $05b in additional earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in year one $07b in year two and $10b in year three assuming zero ebitda growth the remaining 7 years of the 10 year deal a conservative assumption penn will generate $92b in ebitda over the 10 year deal life penn is paying espn $15b in cash and $05b in warrants long term call options for a total payment to espn of $20b if management hits these ebitda targets that will generate a 360 return on investment for this deal bottom line is i think the espn marketing deal will be a huge catalyst for this beaten up stock down 27 this year trading at just under $26 i think it s reasonable that penn shares trade back up to near their 52 week high of $36 given management s projected near 100 ebitda growth over the next 3 years also i think overall stock market risk is neutral in the short to medium term as the interest rate hike cycle is coming to an end

how the fed and banks are losing trust step by step with a forecasted 25 basis point rate hike let s think about why the fed started bailing out banks and even opened the floodgates but people kept taking money out of banks a dozen banks on wall street started bailing out first republic bank but last night first republic bank s stock price still fell nearly 50 ubs sold itself to ubs at a 4 valuation but ubs s acquisition was not as painful as these events what is the reason behind this one is that the fed said in 2021 that inflation was only temporary and then inflation suddenly became the biggest problem in front of people all over the world so in 2022 there was the strongest wave of interest rate hikes in history and global financial markets fell through their pants and if we want accountability it was actually the fed s error in judgment but we bore the consequences so we don t trust the fed from powell s point of view he definitely wants to raise interest rates after all the fight against inflation is his main task but now the banking crisis the biden administration and other countries in the world that have a lot of us debt the pressure of debt to powell is infinite which is the reason there is a choice to stop raising interest rates but i think tomorrow night will still raise rates as usual 25 basis points the reason is that the bank of england also did so raise rates qe will also another point is that if march does not raise rates inflation really can not hold april is no rate hike resolution can only wait until may to add so the risk is greater so this time to add 25 even if after the market panic the fed can also use other means to appease the market the big deal is to say in advance of the may rate cut chant so think about the fact that it is not so the market will be in a state of panic this is my personal opinion if you have any good comments welcome to leave a message translated with deepl

why is that hindenburg a foreign entity was able to create such a major impact on indian share market isn t it bothering that india has the finest finance professionals accountants and analysts who i think could definitely do the research and blow the whistle on the adani group but it takes a foreign entity to go down the rabbit hole and investigate and then publish it that wipes out $100 billion in valuation from the indian share market even the mf houses were aware about some irregularities in the adani group companies which is why they didn t invest in adani i m sure there were far more bigger entities in india itself who were aware and it would take a handful of indians to come together and do the digging and publish their findings even now sebi and rbi seem very slow to take any action and investigate
if the whole world agreed on buying some stock when it s price is 50 and sell when it s 60 what would happen if the whole world buys at 50 the price would instantly increase because of the insane amount of demand for the stock then at 60 the whole world sells all making a profit of 20 by selling the supply grows and the price drops to 50 upon which the whole world buys again in my ape brain this seems like an infinite money glitch can some smarter ape explain where i m thinking wrong

nvda is the wrong bet on ai so right now nvda is trading on a billion percent of earnings on the thesis that generative ai is the future of every industry and nvda makes the chips which make generative ai possible this is wrong and here s why don t get me wrong nvda is a great company they make industryleading products and they have been extremely savvy in getting industries like aiml and the gaming market to become dependent on their proprietary technologies they always seem to be one step ahead in embedding themselves the most important industries for a long enough time that it s hard to say this could be an accident i m also not an ai naysayer i m not sure if it will live up to the hype but it s entirely possible that generative ai will be a transformative technology which will change our lives for decades to come but the current nvda valuation seems to imply that nvda will maintain it s current defacto monopoly on ai hardware into perpetuity and that is simply unlikely the only reason nvda currently dominates is because they own cuda which most of the software backing ai relies on but there s nothing magic about cuda which will prevent generative ai models to be trained and run on other hardware eventually when the software catches up and you can be sure every other chip maker is working hard to make this happen google already has their own proprietary ai hardware which by some reports is more efficient than nvda s a100 s and h100 s so nvda has a lead but if generative ai proves to be the cashcow that it promises to be other chip makers will surely elbow their way into the market and eat some of nvda s lunch so enjoy those juicy returns while you can heck i m even an nvda holder myself since the days when it was under $100 but the current valuation is just not based in reality imo if ai is indeed the play the smart money long term is on cloud providers who are going to be the ones renting out time on ai hardware which will increasingly exist as a commodity item and chip makers like nvda and amd will be forced to trim margins to fight for space in data centers

crox back in the early 2000s a hollywood costume designer with a limited budget needed to find a shoe that both looked incredibly stupid and futuristic at the same time in 2006 idiocracy was released and became a cult classic and the shoe the costume designer chose on was the then unknown crocs idiocracy 2006 crocs were originally targeted at rich white male boatowners a business model that failed spectacularly and sent the company and stock into a decadelong hibernation by 2019 crocs management finally decided to lean into their absurdist image instead of fighting it and through ironic collaborations with highfashion brands was able to revive its image among younger demographics who want to stand out in social media landing on piper sandler s top 10 shoe brands among teens in fall 2019 before the pandemics and has been there since i m going to let this sub of regards in on a little secret to investing the most important thing is to find a place where the marginal movers of capital are wrong and you know why they re wrong in this case the marginal movers of capital are still mostly middleaged to older white men and they do not understand crocs as a brand and most still have firsthand experience of crocs failing in 2006 when it was targeting the wrong demographic this creates a behavioral opportunity which is rare you can all go chase weed and ai all you want but i guarantee you smarter people than you are doing the same exact thing but those same smart people don t understand crocs because instead of making them feel smart to talk about it makes them feel silly to talk about this is why crocs trades at a heavy discount to the entire industry despite having the highest operating margins in the industry as well as doubledigit growth after postcovid slowdown we can see this behavioral bias in play given recent events since crocs acquired heydude a more normal looking shoe croc s stock price has traded entirely off the performance of heydude segment quarter to quarter and is now trading close to where it was prior to acquiring an accretive company in short this is a casino but you have the option of playing poker against the pros or joining me at the one slot machine that s been miscalibrated by the house since they don t really understand it and more importantly don t sound smart talking about it because crocs are ridiculous and job security on the street being right plenty more to say but i know most of you regards have already stopped reading so we can discuss in comments

the market is slowing down with tomorrow being new years eve the illiquid market has slowed down as traders are closing up their books for the year winding down any ideas and thoughts its important to see what is waiting for us up ahead this week the biggest story is tesla s brutal december decline as it went down about 40 in value as popular as it is elon musk s twitter has cost more time taking away from the automobile company tesla is currently at its lowest since august 2020 it will be exciting to see what elon musk has planned to recover his losses another notable decrease was in the nasdaq 100 following in suit with tesla from a technical perspective the 10 500 area is a critical level in addition to marking the 2022 lows it also represents the 618 fibonacci retracement of the entire postcovid rally while bulls would certainly like to see a big rally off this support confluence the bigger picture outlook for the index will remain bearish as long as it continues to put in lower highs on the daily chart meanwhile a confirmed break below support in the 10 500 area would open the door for a continuation down to the precovid high at 9 700 or even the 786 fibonacci retracement near 8 900 as we move through the first quarter of 2023 it will be interesting to see how the tech market will recover from this year s downfall
charlie munger quotes mentor to warren buffett and multibillionaire stock market investor himself 1 here are 85 famous charlie munger quotes in honor of his birthday 2 it takes character to sit with all that cash and to do nothing i didn t get to the top where i am by going after mediocre opportunities 3 to get what you want you have to deserve what you want that world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of people 4 being something and doing something that no one had done before are two different things 5 those who keep learning will keep rising in life 6 if you keep learning all the time you have a huge advantage 7 you don t have to be brilliant only a little bit wiser than the other guys on average for a long long time 8 people calculate too much and think too little 9 a majority of life s errors are caused by forgetting what one is really trying to do 10 the best thing a human can do is to help another human being know more 11 knowing what you don t know is more useful than being brilliant 12 the habit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is no accident 13 like warren i had a considerable passion to get rich not because i wanted ferrari s i wanted the independence i desperately wanted it 14 one of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simplethe system often goes out of control 15 if you skillfully follow the multidisciplinary path you will never wish to come back it would be like cutting off your hands 16 just the discipline of having to put your thoughts in order with somebody else is very useful thing 17 opportunity comes to the prepared mind 18 i met the towering intellectuals in books not in classroom which is natural my family was into all that stuff getting ahead through discipline knowledge and selfcontrol 19 i paid no attention to the territorial boundaries of academic disciplines and i just grabbed all the big ideas that i could 20 it is remarkable how much longterm advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be intelligent 21 to this day i have never taken a course anywhere in chemistry economics psychology or business 22 i try to get rid of people who confidently answer questions about which they don t have any real knowledge 23 i believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out i don t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself 24 another thing i think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one s mindwhen you re young it s easy to drift into royalties and when you announce that you re a loyal memberand you re gradually ruining your mind 25 simplicity has a way of improving performance by enabling us to better understand what we are doing 26 you should avoid sloth and unreliability 27 generally speaking envy resentment and selfpity are disastrous modes of thoughts selfpity gets fairly close to paranoia and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse 28 people should take away less than they re worth when they are favored by lifei would argue that when you rise high enough in american business you ve got a moral duty to be underpaid 29 those of us who have been fortunate have a duty to give back whether one gives a lot as one goes along as i do or a little and then a lot when one dies as warren does is a matter of personal preference 30 no man is fit to hold office who isn t perfectly willing to leave it at any time 31 acknowledging what you don t know is the dawning of wisdom 32 we recognized early on that smart people do very dumb things and we wanted to know why and who so that we could avoid them 33 we have a passion for keeping things simple 34 we have three baskets for investing yes no and too tough to understand 35 live within your income and save so you can invest learn what you need to learn 36 it s waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just can t stand to wait if you didn t get the deferred gratification gene you ve got to work very hard to overcome that 37 a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price 38 an intelligent investing is value investing acquiring more than you are paying for 39 the big money is not in buying or selling but in the waiting 40 a lot of people with high iqs are terrible investors because they ve got terrible temperaments 41 when you borrow a man s car always return it with a tank of gas 42 the most famous composer in the world but was utterly miserable most of the time and of the reasons was because he always overspent his income this was mozart if mozart couldn t get by with this kind of asinine conduct i don t think you should try 43 we re not interested in taking a substantial chance of taking a lot of very decent people back to go so we can have one more zero on our net worth 44 the liabilities are always 100 percent good it s the assets you have to worry about 45 take a simple idea and take it seriously 46 mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean 47 wall street has too much wealth and political power 48 it s like the slaughter of the innocents it makes the people who run las vegas seem like good people 49 i ve seen so much folly and stupidity on the part of our major philanthropic groups including the world bank i really have more confidence in building up the more capitalistic ventures like costco 50 we both warren buffett insist on a lot of time being available almost every day to just sit and think that is very uncommon in american business we read and think 51 our game is to recognize a big idea when it comes along when one doesn t come along very often 52 ninetynine percent of the troubles that threaten our civilization come from too optimistic therefore we should have a system where the accounting is a way more conservative 53 a lot of people think if you just had more process and more compliance checks and doublechecks and so forthyou could create a better world we just try to operate in a seamless web of deserved trust and be careful of whom we trust 54 everywhere there is a large commission there is a high probability of a ripoff 55 part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds life in part is like a poker game wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a muchloved hand 56 in my whole life i have known no wise peoplewho didn t read all the time none zero you d be amazed at how much warren reads at how much i readthey think i m a book with a couple of legs sticking out 57 develop into a lifelong selflearner through voracious reading cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day 58 assume life will be really tough and then ask if you can handle it if the answer is yes you ve won 59 just because you like it does not mean that the world will necessarily give it to you 60 i would argue that passion is more important than brainpower 61 is there such a thing as a cheerful pessimist that s what i am 62 the iron rule of nature is you get what you reward for if you want ants to come you put sugar on the floor 63 another thing of course is that life will have terrible blows in it horrible blows unfair blows it doesn t matter and some people recover and others don t 64 confucious said that real knowledge is knowing the extent of one s ignorance aristotle and socrates said the same thing is it a skill that can be taught or learned it probably can if you have enough of a stake riding on the outcome 65 wisdom acquisition is a moral duty it s not something you do just to advance in lifeyou are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know you re going to advance in life by what you learn after you leave here 66 some people are extraordinarily good at knowing the limits of their knowledge because they have to be 67 spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up discharge your duties faithfully and well systematically you get ahead but not necessarily in fast spurtsat the end of the day if you live long enough most people get what they deserve 68 one solution fits all is not the way to go all these cultures are different the right culture for the mayo clinic is different from the right culture at a hollywood movie studio you can t run all these places with a cookiecutter solution 69 there s a tendency to think that our present politicians are much worse than we had in the past but we tend to forget how awful our politicians were in the past 70 the highest form that civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trustnot much procedure just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another 71 you must force yourself to consider opposing arguments especially when they challenge your bestloved ideas 72 remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat 73 most people are too fretful they worry too much success means being very patient but aggressive when it s time 74 always take the high road it s far less crowded 75 you don t have to have the ability that quantum mechanics requires you just have to know a few simple things and really know them 76 don t drift into selfpity because it doesn t solve any problems 77 it s not supposed to be easy anyone who finds it easy is stupid 78 you need patience discipline and agility to take losses and adversity without going crazy 79 there is not more money to be made from law but less time to enjoy it 80 no wise pilot no matter how great his talent and experience fails to use a checklist 81 if something is too hard we move on to something else what could be more simpler than that 82 i think that one should recognize the reality even when one doesn t like it indeed especially when one doesn t like it 83 the best armor of old age is a wellspent life perfecting it 84 there is no way you can live an

fed minutes of may meeting recap points worth mentioning sharing this post of mine also here just in case any nerds have any thoughts tldr well then you certainly won t enjoy reading through the actual minutes overall i don t believe the bottom is in looking forward market and surveybased measures of us inflation expectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years nonetheless farforward inflation compensation rose over the period and market participants remained attentive to the risk that in bringing inflation back to 2 percent the committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected to me this seems to fit in line with how the markets have struggled to price things in officially because of the high level of uncertainty surrounding the fed s moves going forward for the rate hike this month we all knew it was no longer 25bps but there were definitely people who thought that 75bps was a real possibility instead of 50bps other numbers regarding housing and consumer spending has shown that outside of market participants there are a lot of citizens out there still willing to spend cash on services and experiences in order to quell this many believe the fed needs to do more as indicated here unemployment and inflation total nonfarm payroll employment rose in march and the unemployment rate declined to 36 percent the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics moved lower though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average the labor force participation rate increased in march as did the employmenttopopulation ratio the privatesector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey remained elevated the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 48 percent over the 12 months ending in march this gain was much larger than the corresponding 2month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12month increase since 1990 from my understanding of the most recent live speech given by jpow with the wsj which took place after the meeting for these minutes jpow did all he could to dance around deliberately saying they cannot achieve their goals of lowering inflation without creating an uptick in the unemployment rate here we see in the quarter that unemployment actually declined which to me leaves the fed thinking they have more to do in cooling inflation with such pent up demand from supply chain and covid for the past two years people are still willing to spend and the fed has it works cut out to suppress this i believe what s prolonging this task is how much wages have risen for people and in turn have allowed them to bear the brunt of inflation part of the outlook section all told total pce price inflation was expected to be 43 percent in 2022 pce price inflation was then expected to step down to 25 percent in 2023 and to 21 percent in 2024 as supplydemand imbalances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggregate demand and an anticipated easing of supply constraints the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside pivotal part to me is the skewed to up the side because time and time again we had heard rumblings of peak inflation after months of it being transitory as well of course they have to say that their plans are set to move inflation down but all estimatesprojections come with asterisk of hey things out of our control could make this worse creditdebtlending for most small businesses credit appeared to be available although these businesses demand for credit reportedly remained weak i don t have a full take on this point but i think it is interesting enough to mention we around march when the consumer credit numbers were released that consumer credit had been racking it up in record breaking levels but here we see that small businesses often linked to the middle class and working citizens that they were not looking for credit did they not need it could they not afford to take on debt of any kind i don t know the credit quality of firms municipalities and households remained strong overall the volume of credit rating upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in march continuing a nearly yearlong pattern the credit quality of ci loans on banks books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in february while in the cre sector borrower financial health continued to recover household credit quality remained strong and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards per recent articles in the wsj and bloomberg this does not seem to be the case anymore business debt remained elevated relative to its prepandemic history but interest coverage ratios were high do you see this deteriorating we see some larger cap tickers already saying they are not looking to hire as much saving money starts small but its methods expand to all aspects of business when times get tough the staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions nbfis was elevated and that bank lending to nbfis continued to increase notably relatedly nbfis reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks during times of financial stress i found this to be interesting it was the last part of the staff review of economic situation section they said that banks are well capitalized that the consumer is strong and that credit ratings for companies had gone up overall during this time but then why are nfbi s needing to borrow so much money nfbi s can be considered as payday loan providers and even companies like jcrew by offering store credit cards reverse repos market participants noted that ongoing uncertainty about the nearterm path of federal reserve policy had increased demand for very shortdated investments this demand combined with declining treasury bill supply contributed to the downward pressure on secured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp usage the manager expected that on rrp usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that over the longer term usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded it is worth noting again that these notes are from the meetings on may 3rd since then rrps reverse repos have hit an all time of $2 trillion meaning that almost a month later we have still seen rrps grow which to me means that big money players out there are still feeling unsafe in parking their money places overnight to this day meaning if they re uncertain about things still then we should still be cautiously worried about he economic outlook households households debttogdp ratio remained relatively low and there were few signs of increased stress among lowerincome households i wonder what he gauge will be like in their eyes next meeting or come the fall in their discussion of the household sector participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consumption spending they pointed to several elements supporting this outlook including strong household balance sheets wide availability of jobs and the us economy s resilience in the face of new waves of the virus see my second comment of the next section gdpinflation below employment growth had continued at a strong pace the unemployment rate had fallen to a near50year low quits and job openings had remained extremely elevated and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly in addition a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply how do we have participants saying that the consumer spending is robust and strong and that they see growth this year then say well maybe there are so many people coming back to look for jobs because they need money stagflation incoming most participants indicated that their business contacts had continued to report that substantial increases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers eventually there is going to be a tipping point in what consumers are willing to pay right gdpinflation the staff therefore anticipated that gdp growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year well we will find out in 7 hours participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021 real gdp had declined in the first quarter of this year with net exports and inventory investment making large negative contributions to growth they noted however that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong in the first quarter honestly stagflation may become a real issue if the fed does all they can to quell the inflation but consumer spending is not stopped due to wage increases and its lagging effects this could lead to trouble i m conflicted though because in a sense i can feel inflation in daily life and i find it hard to believe that the consumer really is strong but if the spending numbers are strong still as they keep mentioning gotta remember this is for q1 though i feel like that puts us more in the direction of stagflation in addition some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longerterm inflation expectations could become unanchored in that case the task of returning inflation to 2 percent would be more difficult this in reference to household balance sheets being strong due to cash stimulus qe of covid times and wage raises are record increases i wonder what participants said this because this is the smart take in my opinion we ll see inflation more plateaued like for a long time before we see anything near 2 again yoy rates and fed balance sheet most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings i wonder if those who were not part of the most were more in favor of 75bps or 25bps i still think 75bps is truly on the table this reduction starting on june 1 would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary policy a number of participants remarked that after balance sheet runoff was well under way it would be appropriate for the committee to consider sales of agency mbs to enable suitable progress toward a longerrun soma portfolio composed primarily of treasury securities any program of sales of agency mbs would be announced well in advance regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial market conditions since may 4th spy has fallen about 82 and since may 5th it has fallen about 48 but some think once more qt comes into fruition on june 1st that more pain is on the way i wonder if there is a way to play this i used to think tbt was a solid way once the fed started to get bonds of their balance sheet but i don t know at present participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance they also noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook i view this on a scale from easy neutral restrictive scale and we are somewhere between the neutral and restrictive side meaning that the fed has to be more hawkish in its action due to things out of their control like supply chains with china and commodities in europe
story time nvidia coreweave magnetard capital and the next bubble to pop gather round for some big short margin call level shit the goal of this post isn t to accuse any financial firm or nvidia of breaking any laws because we all know our existing laws let the big dogs do whatever the fuck they want with zero consequences it s to start figuring out whether we re really on the precipice of the next ai revolution probably not given how a cone can stop a cruise car from moving and elon s fsd ran a red light on stream or the next mania induced bubble x200b 2001 com bubble 2008 mbs bubble 2017 crypto bubble 2021 spacnft trash bubble 2023 ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai bubble if you ve read this far then have i got a timeline for you x200b magnetard capital is a hedge fund who helped exacerbate the 2008 financial crisis by putting together extremely toxic subprime mortgages and then betting against them via cdos they re known within wall street as one of the more deplorable hedge funds to exist and it makes some sense as the founder and ceo of magnetard capital alec litowitz comes from a hedge fund we all know and love ken griffin s citadel llc the magnetar trade how one hedge fund helped keep the bubble going a fund behind astronomical losses fine but what does this have to do with nvidia and coreweave x200b coreweave was originally called hudson ridge asset management and founded in 2012 by three former natural gas futures traders enron vibes anyone turned crypto bros who renamed their company the atlantic crypto corporation in 2017 to capitalize on the burgeoning retail crypto bubble after riding that fad into the ground they pivoted from eth mining and renamed themselves coreweave on october 28 2021 two weeks after coreweave was founded magnetard capital invests $50 million into coreweave despite the two week old company having no patents products or anything of substance that same day nvidia announces coreweave is now an nvidia elite partner for compute strange nov 2022 chatgpt becomes the new fad everyone can t stop talking about especially your creepy bald uncle who wants to know if the ai can write erotic novellas hypothetically of course dec 2022 coreweave secures another $100 million from magnetard capital again coreweave has no products patents or services april 2023 coreweave gets another $221 million led by magnetard capital and nvidia as a secondary investor may 2023 coreweave secures $200 million in a series b extension bringing the total magnetard capital has invested in coreweave to nearly half a billion dollars august 3 2023 coreweave announces they ve raised 23 billion in debt from magnetard capital blackstone blackrock and some other shady financial firms all collateralized by nvidia h100 chips meaning they bought 23 billion dollars worth of h100 chips prior to this debt agreement presumably before nvidia s q2 closed at the end of july 2023 august 23 2023 nvidia beats earnings expectations and specifically beats their datacenter guide by exactly 23 billion dollars coincidence i guess the bulls will saydemand is off the charts if everyone can t get enough chips and nvidia can t make them fast enough why are they funneling sales of a chip no one can get their hands on through a brand new company run by former nat gas and crypto traders that have no experience with cloud deep learning or ai who are backed by one of the shadiest hedge funds of all time x200b and if demand is so strong why is nvidia s inventory up 98 yoy and at 4 year record highs nvidia s existing inventory this isn t nvidia s stock price it s their current inventory levels in summary what all these shady entities including nvidia are doing may not be illegal but it brings up some very valid questions about how strong demand actually is beyond the mania driven headlines and if nvidia hadn t pulled a hat trick with that 23 billion pull forward funneled through coreweave and missed guidance many hedge funds and the broader market would risk having their ai bubble pop too soon because get this august 30 2023 nvidiabacked coreweave seeks stake sale at up to $8 billion valuation x200b all credit goes to this guy aka nobody special who is still unraveling this entire saga as we speak
lynchgreenblatt stock aso i have found this stock using magic formula which means that they had quite low stock valuation evebitda 6 and high returns roe 41 it is a simple boring sporting goods retail store chain present in 18 states mainly bible belt their current strategy is to open 80100 new stores in the next 5 years more than one store a month company still seems to be quite undervalued considering their peg ration 05 i think that they can sustain high onedigit growth due to their high returns and effective business model that takes advantage of socioeconomic conditions of southern states i valued the comapny at around 80$ in the 12 month period
the impact of ai to the jobless rate the ai definitely would replace the employee working force for example if for one job were needed 10 people now 5 people would do it so what would be the outcome 1 will the companies make massive layoffs and therefore increase the unemployment a lot so there would be very low consumer spending because a lot of people would be jobless so the companies will lower their salesrevenues 2 the companies will not make layoffs and would keep and pay the same salary to the employees who would work much less like in 8 hour working time they would work for like 34 hours and get the same salary as before when they worked 8 hours because ai would be doing their job for them but in this case the companies will have so much unnecessary salary expenses please share your opinions

weekend read this bbby run is starting to look eerily similar to the gme run in jan 21 just some personal observations having gone through the gamestop runup both gme and bbby started their run and sputtered a bit and finished the first week up around 3040 rough percentages i don t have the actual prices in front of me second week gme gapped up the following monday around 30 and ended up the week up around 60 or so second week for bbby is also a gap up on monday and ended up the week over 60 from last friday third week is where all the action in gme took place a big 50 gap up monday before it settled down a bit lower and then huge moves on that tues and wed closing the week around $320 let s see what this upcoming third week brings to bbby some other observations gme short percentage of the float was definitely higher and shorts were caught off guard you d think they re better prepared this time also ryan cohen took his stake around 4 months before the gme runup and here we are 5 months after he disclosed his stake in march the other observation is the level of contempt the financial media and analysts had for gme as though they knew better and tried to save us from our own stupidity analysts started coming out of the woodwork panning gme how it s a failing business how it s going bankrupt how it ll be back to $5 next week even that same dude anthony chukumba was all over cnbc and bloomberg talking how gamestop is worth $10 and that s him being generous the higher the fever pitch against gme the more interest the stock generated on this board and elsewhere as if it was an us against them battle the more people bought the stock and calls the higher chance for a gamma squeeze and here we are again with call options exploding and heading into monthly expiration where things can get really wild tldr similarities between gme and bbby runs could mean an explosive week coming up strap your belts

nasdaq and qqq moving averages has anyone noticed that the 50day sma is slightly above the 200day sma on the weekly with these two moving averages not crossed since the gfa does this not concern anyone over 13 years of the 50 stayings well above 200 on the weekly seems like a rather long time doesn t it along with the weekly chart showing that it s more oversold than the rally during the pandemic this chart doesn t lie and charts are rather good indicators of what will happen in the future i believe and that is a major correction will hit the market i know a lot of people don t like to discuss charts in relation to weekly or monthly timeframes mostly because it doesn t depict much in relation to shortterm trends but i was just wanting to put this out there to see if anyone has the insight to share thanks

sell high buy low thoughts from a golden corral cook while the housing market and homebuilding market has finally showed signs of a significant pull back during the last month or so the automotive market has forged ahead with no sort of reversal that is about to change auto lenders have recently become much more stringent in adhering to their lending parameters they realize cars have been vastly overpriced for two years and the ltv on these loan agreements is just absurd there is also growing sentiment among used car dealers that their inventory is going to put them in a really bad position during the next 612 months in short they are going to be stuck with expensive inventory they know they ve overpaid for while every dealer was desperate to put cars for sale on their lots carvana although more of a growthstock used car dealer is far off its highs that company also happens to be a total piece of shit carmax is significantly off its highs as well but major newused dealers autonation and penske auto group are still at alltime highs up 400500 from covid lows for the two aforementioned companies to even come close to sustaining the profitability they ve experienced during the last 15 years they d need to continue crushing it in the used car market because the new car market sucks yes dealers have been able to destroy customers in new car sales as inventory has been nonexistent and demand has been through the roof but this theme is quickly changing new car dealers still enjoy an unprecedented leverage but they are losing leverage every day now as supply and demand levels out any dealer with a significant used car inventory is about to feel the pain if they ve been overpaying for inventory i expect the unprecedented profitability for new used auto dealers like autonation and penske to come to a quick halt and reverse course going into the end of 2022 weed stocks have been obliterated but have appeared to find a bottom during the last month or two most useless analysts have been screaming to buy discounted weed companies all the way down and now that they ve bottomed the predictable sell weed stocks they won t be profitable until 2026 buffoonery is occurring these weed stocks have literally never been cheaper they ve found a technical bottom and they have the everpresent meme potential i don t necessarily have a favorite but tilray has a huge presence in canada a significant and growing presence in the us and by far the biggest presence in eu as they already sell medically in numerous countries if germany was to approve recreational use in the near future seems more and more likely tilray would enjoy a significant firstmover advantage there tldr wsb can get it right for once buy puts at the theoretical top of the automotive sales market buy calls at the theoretical bottom of the weed stock market personally i d buy calls for no earlier than some time in 2023 but i m just a golden corral cook
you regards are early to those out there predicting a market crash in the next few months you are early very early stop equating the real economy to the stock market there is zero direct connection between the 2 yes it s rough here in the real world but the market is forward thinking and currently pricing in a soft landing stagnation be aware on fomc days as most major sentiment swings happen but otherwise just keep accumulating wendy s paychecks for the big kahoona typically a market crash happens after the fed reverses since that s the point when they acknowledge the economy is broken and needs a liquidity injection on the flip side those of who you think that the fed saved the banks are just as delusional the fastest rate hikes in history caused the second largest bank crash in us history and rates are only going up from here even if it is just 50bps more this ain t over just cause jpow and jyel say it is things will happen slowly then all at once just don t go broke buying puts before the fed reverses
ray dalio on the debt ceiling debate an option trader s summary tldr ray dalio founder of bridgewater associates shares his thoughts on the ongoing us debt ceiling debate his central point is that both increasing and not increasing the debt limit will have disastrous consequences a smart bipartisan plan that reforms the system and focuses on productivity could prevent a terrible outcome likely outcome dalio predicts that democrats and republicans will avoid a longterm default and instead adopt shortterm solutions that won t address the core issues dalio argues against this approach dalio s background dalio s perspective is shaped by his role as a global macro investor focusing on five major forces moneycrediteconomy politics geopolitics natural events and learningtechnology for him political polarization is currently the greatest threat to sound decisionmaking the political landscape according to dalio three political types exist today the hardright the hardleft and the bipartisan moderate dalio identifies as a bipartisan moderate and warns that extreme polarization will intensify conflicts possibly leading to a nonviolent civil war risks of increasing the debt limit if the debt limit is repeatedly raised without restrictions dalio sees a potential for a financial collapse the endless cycle of spending more than one earns and covering it with debt is unsustainable and could lead to a debt crisis risks of not increasing the debt limit on the other hand failing to raise the debt limit could result in default or cutbacks for those least able to afford them causing financial and social upheaval solution dalio believes that a smart bipartisan plan that comprehensively addresses the us s financial economic and national debt issues is necessary swiftly settling the debt issue without addressing the root causes is not a sustainable solution the battle dalio suggests that the fight between moderates willing to compromise and extremists who aren t needs to happen it s time for moderate leaders from both parties to band together and challenge the extremes in their parties reforming capitalism dalio also stresses the importance of reforming capitalism to ensure collective earnings exceed spending he believes productivity often neglected is key to improving incomes without reducing living standards both political sides should focus on productivity and fair distribution of benefits concluding thoughts dalio insists his views aren t as important as the creation of a smart bipartisan plan by skilled moderates ready to fight extremists this represents a chance for courageous moderates to band together and act despite potential political costs remember this is a summary of dalio s article meant to provide you with a quicker read while retaining the core of his argument for a full understanding of his views i encourage you to read the original piece

$tsla guide to playing the tsla stock split as all of you who have long traded tsla know tsla stock price follows laws of numerology in particular it has strong affinity for price points like $69 $1337 $420 and let us not forget $42069 which is the most powerful of these because the board is going to do a 31 split and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it we can trade options in anticipation quite simply a future share at $42069 is thus $126207 in current value since $42069 $126207 or you can add $42069 three times if you can t do multiplication the split sounds like it should be done by fall so the play is therefore to simply buy up november or october calls at $1262 or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it s itm call it $1200 these calls in turn split into basically $420c or $400c i made jokes about this last time and everyone thought i was being a moron but had i actually done the trade i would ve made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously last time this happened and crossed 420 because past results are often a prediction of future performance we can expect tsla stock to end up north of $42069 since that is the nature of things good luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning remember tesla s biggest product is not the model 3 but rather its stock and they ll have three times as much of it bullish many exceptions always apply

to the regards who are bullish on unity $u i replied to a comment on another post but since i did some actual work for my comment i decided to make a separate post about it for you regards to read too the average revenue per download in 2022 was just $202 per statista this is before costs such as paying a salary to your devs apple s and google s 30 cut taxes etc according to macrotrendsnet the profit margin of the average game was 63 as of june 2023 using these metrics you can estimate that your average game currently makes about 0127$ profit per download as you can see taking 020$ from that is going to be very problematic especially when you consider that half of the games perform worse than the average and even if your game is better than the average game you will still struggle to make profit for example angry birds 2 was downloaded around 900 000 times last month and made just over 3 million dollars in revenue numbers from sensortower that s a little over 33$ per download which is roughly 50 better than the average game i don t know what percentile of games that goes to but it seems to be way way better than the average according to rovio s q2 23 report their profit margin was a bit over 10 again above average so unity just unilaterally decided that rovio should lose 60 of their profits 033$ 02$ sure this change doesn t kill the evergreens or whale games like genshin impact or pokemon go but it will kill a vast majority of games and devs if implemented there is 0 chance that the owners of companies like rovio etc will accept this i assume that the whales aren t too happy about it either this is extremely bad for unity s business in the long and short term even if the big games swallow this extra cost because there won t be games developed with unity i also assume that the whale devs won t accept this either as this discourages them from developing anything new too to put things even more into perspective the top10 grossing games alone make around 16 of the total revenue that the mobile games industry generates so the situation is extremely bad for gaming industry on average more than half of games won t be able to operate any longer i can t say how many games are getting killed but my guess is that this is killing at least 6075 of games developed with unity unity should have either implemented a licence cost for using their engine or a 5 or higher revenue tax like unreal does with either option the cost would ve scaled with the size of your game and half of the entire industry wouldn t have been destroyed tldr unity has decided to kill the majority of games industry unity is worse than thanos

goldman s upcoming fomc preview staying on the slow growth path what follows is a summary of the jan27th gs economic research notefomc preview since the fomc last met in december incoming data on wage growth inflation have been encouraging while signals on activity growth have been mixed sometimes concerning this ended up making the case for slowing the pace of hikes to 25bps key question for february meeting is what the fomc will signal about further hikes this year fomc s goal this year is clear it aims to continue in 2023 what it began in 2022 by staying on a belowpotential growth path in order to rebalance the labor market so that inflation can return sustainably to 2 goldman agrees with fed officials that there is still a long way to go the jobsworkers gap is still about 3mm above prepandemic levels how many hikes needed to stay on this path is less clear gs expects 25bps each in march may fewer may be needed if weak business confidence depresses hiring investment more may be needed if economy reaccelerates as the impact of past tightening fades fed officials appear to expect two more hikes will likely tone down the reference to ongoing hikes being appropriate in the fomc statement since fomc last met in december two trends in the economic data have strengthened the case for slowing to 25bps next wednesday 1 encouraging data on wage growth inflation deceleration in average hourly earnings atlanta fed wage growth tracker another round of soft inflation data continued collapse in alternative leading indicators of rent inflation decline in 1yr umich consumer inflation expectations now 15 lower than start of hikes 2 signals on activity growth have become more mixed sometimes concerning large gap now between gdp goldman s current activity indicator large gap between hard data components of cai soft data components like surveys etc gs take nominal bias neg sentiment driven by recession fears is depressing survey data uncertainty about the nearterm outlook has risen key question what will fomc signal about further hikes this yr gs thinks fed s path is best thought of in terms of a goal to be accomplished rather than a target level of the funds rate to be reached this goal is to continue in 2023 what the fomc began successfully in 2022 by keeping the economy on a belowpotential growth path in order to steadily but gently rebalance the labor market which should in turn create the conditions for inflation to settle sustainably at 2 this goal was clear in the fomc s december economic projections which showed that the median participant forecasted read aimed to achieve the exact same slow rate of gdp growth in 2023 as in 2022 there s a long way to go before fed officials will have confidence that inflation will settle at 2 sustainably goldman s take substantial further labor market rebalancing will be needed as the jobsworkers gap is about 3m above its prepandemic level making it necessary to stay on the slow growth path for a while longer how many rate hikes will be needed to keep the economy on this belowpotential growth path in 2023 is less clear gs continues to expect a hike on wednesday feb 1 two additional 25bp hikes in march may raising the target ff rate to a peak of 5525 but it s easy to imagine scenarios where the fomc does either less or more fewer hikes might be needed if recent weakening in business confidence captured by the survey data depresses hiring investment more than projected substituting for additional rate hikeshowever more hikes might be needed if the economy reaccelerates as the drag on growth from past fiscal monetary policy tightening fadesthe fomc might need to recalibrate as we learn more about the growth pace could end up in a stopgo pattern at some point later this year final takeaways the december dots indicated that the median fomc participant also expects two additional 25bps hikes after the feb 1 hike gs expects the fomc will tone down the reference to ongoing hikes being appropriate in the fomc statement ie replacing ongoing with further as we at volsignals noted earlier the risk unfolding is in the language which may spur a rushtohedgetake gains if perceived as overly hawkish stay tuned for more on systematic flows fomc previews earnings plays index vol busy week x200b

expectations we can develop a bullish thesis for roku s next earnings call this thesis is built around several key factors growing popularity and subscriber base roku s smart tv operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 16 million new active accounts in q1 2023 this is a clear indicator that the company s user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services improved financial performance roku s ability to trim operating losses showcases the company s effective expense management this is an indication that roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability competitive features roku s offerings are impressive providing a good balance of cost and performance for instance the 55r6a5r model supports all hdr formats has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance and runs on the linuxbased roku os price point and color accuracy roku tvs offer a good balance between cost and performance the qled tvs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range and they cover 96 of the rec 709 color space and 80 of rec 2020 brightness roku s model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness which is a significant improvement over tvs in the same price range user interface roku s user interface is simple easy to navigate and doesn t bombard users with ads this is one of its greatest strengths potential for market expansion if roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band there s potential for them to move into the premium segment positive revenue projection roku s positive revenue forecast of $770 million for q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities potential upside in stock price the current consensus analyst rating for roku is hold but the highend prediction for roku s stock price is $115 this signals a significant upside potential however potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements the lack of support for 120hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming and the requirement to create a roku account to activate the tv an addendum that incorporates some extra key points private listening features one of the unique selling points of roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes this feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules roku os on affordable tvs many sub$500 tvs run on roku os illustrating the popularity of roku s software in the budget segment this allows roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart tvs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience roku stick and boxes consumers often pair roku s external devices such as sticks and boxes with highend tvs from manufacturers like samsung whose inbuilt smart tv features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time roku s standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution userfriendly interface roku s easytonavigate interface with large buttons and voiceactivated remote control is userfriendly making it a popular choice among people of all ages including older adults who may not be as techsavvy this ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to roku s growth and reputation regular updates unlike many manufacturers of budget tvs and settop boxes roku is known for providing regular software updates this commitment to maintaining a reliable uptodate user experience is another factor contributing to roku s popularity manufacturer adoption from a manufacturer s perspective adopting roku s operating system is more convenient and costeffective than developing updating and supporting their own software this ease of integration has led to roku os being adopted in a wide range of devices from budget to highend tvs further expanding roku s market presence in summary these factors enhance the value proposition of roku s products and services attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive

soxl 7770 share yolo into cpi next week it s time to bend these bears over the market is now positioned for an abrupt and epic reversal into year s end that almost no one expects 1 fund manager cash levels are the highest they ve been since the great financial crisis of 20082009 and the pandemic lows equity exposure for fund mangers is the lowest its been since those two events but this is neither of those the job market is still strong and the us economy is not on the brink of collapse like it was in 2009 or during the covid shutdowns when we didn t even know if a vaccine would be made available in the next five years 2 the amount of fear in the market whether it be recession fears of the percent of managers currently underweight equities is the greatest its been since 2009 and april 2020 and in both of those cases the market bottom was already in 3 the fed could be talking a much tougher game than it plans to or even could execute on unlike the 1980s when volcker went crazy with rate hikes the fed simply doesn t have the same kind of wiggle room it once had the debt to gdp ratio is currently over 120 it was less than 35 in the 1980s every 1 increase in interest rates balloons the us deficit by tens of billions of dollars and could eventually make debt payments unmanageable not to mention things in europe are breaking as evidenced by what happened in england therefore i simply do not believe the fed can or will keep interest rates high for all of next year they re bluffing a big part of taming inflation is reducing inflation expectations and the fed is just talking hawkish but will end up acting dovish the current tips spread or the difference in the yields between us treasury bonds and treasury inflationprotected securities is pricing in inflation of 25 five years from now in other words the fed already accomplished its mission of taming inflation expectations 4 the market is forward looking and has already priced in every bearish scenario any positive news and increased confidence that peak inflation is behind us which it is and that record amount of cash on the sidelines will pile in market bottoms tend to occur many months or more before the fed finally pivots and inflation comes down and as painful as it feels going down the abrupt reversal and missed opportunities in the coming months is what will really sting in sum it really is time to bend these bears over and show them how it s done they ve had too much fun this year i could go on but if you want a sober contrarian view to the apocalyptic morons on this sub follow thomas hayes anywhere you can and in the words of the great man himself be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful this weekend i choose the latter position 7770 soxl shares $984

wsb noob here why is this bbby short different than the one in march afternoon all i caught wind of the gamestop shenanigans a little too late and didn t get to participate but i made sure to hop on early with bbby looking at the price fluctuation for bed bath and beyond over the last couple years it looks like it had a big boost in march of this year where it topped out around $28 is anybody kind of enough to explain how this all works and why this particular market boost which is currently peaking around the same price different than the boost in march

roblox dd bullish regrettably disclosure i own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6212024 stock is currently trading at 4398 usd at the time of posting for personal reasons i really wanted to see this company fail after having my roblox account hacked and losing all my items valued at $3k in pv but unfortunately they are growing and will continue to do so roblox isn t just a video game company they are also a virtual economy as well as a tech company fundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable creative and deep in content than any video game in history you can play cod dead by daylight just released by the studio behind fnaf roller coaster simulators elf video game based on the movie tycoon games and more literally any game you can think of you can play on this platform the ingenious way they make profit is similar to how steam does by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games clothing and most importantly limitedrelease collectibles that appreciate over time the main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency robux effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell robux at their own discretion this has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time eg the sparkle time fedora released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1 730 000 robux the equivalent of 2150 cad today as a result many players are buying and holding items some of which are sold in numbered amounts 11000 1350 etc holding their value even in the face of inflation eg released with 400 numbered units retailing for 17 499 robux or 220 cad versus 148 cad 180 days ago if you take a look at the charts over time their items tend to only go in one direction up which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials revenue hit $7132 million up 38 yearoveryear average daily active users daus were 702 million up 20 yearoveryear and hours engaged were 160 billion up 20 yearoveryear suffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the chain smokers lil naz x the weeknd disney dead by daylight and more they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product in terms of liquidity they have 21 billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres invest in more developers and partnerships and continue on the path towards profitability in the shortterm macroeconomic environment we have the holidays coming up and if you talk to a lot of parents kids are going crazy for roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game i predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40 if we follow the same pattern last year 28 usd on dec 30th to 3775 by jan 27th in the longterm roblox s technology is insane they have full software support for vr a giant user base and the ability for usersdevelopers to come in and build anything not to mention it is lucrative for them as well as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game with vr technology becoming cheaper year over year this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers businesses etc not a huge metaverse fan in general but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn t a bad idea in short i think roblox has a lot of room to grow with insane potential for growth over the next few years i m confident that even in the face of rising inflation which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive vr world

synthetic long on mstr i am considering this risky trade on mstr which has an unhealthy relationship with btc its risky because if the price of btc or mstr go down then i would have to exit this strategy asap synthetic 1 251219 240c mstr 2 251219 240p to give $5650 credit this pays off as long as mstr stays above $211 other combinations generate different payoffs for instance selling 2x 280p and buying a 120c gives a similar credit but max loss is increased etc anybody have anything to add to this

vfs dd this company is going to get reported for sec fraud 11 315 sold globally during the first half of 2023 where 7100 of those vehicles were sold to themselves nowhere does the 6k filing mention that it sold the majority of those to a subsidiary it s snakey and devious how a company with 23b shares and only a float of 7 million allowed to trade on the nyse is beyond me it s created an inflated value that compares in mc to ford with a fraction of sales or product i make it no secret i think this is going down to 0 but for nobody to do dd and piece together that maybe a company that has a float of 34 maybe should be on the nyse that s not a typo less than half of 1 this is bananas in their f1 filing it shows them loosing 600 million in the first 3 months of 2023 that s above pace for their net loss of 21 billion in 2022 im definitely regarded but even a simpleton like myself can smell blood in the water more capital will need to be raised in the coming year forbes evaluated this company at 54 cents a share spacs are insider shares dreams come true glta

dod confirms there is a silver metal shortage switches to inferior lithium for batteries did war make silver rarer than gold now x200b document shows a need by the military to switch to an inferior battery for their buoys and potentially other needs such as missiles and torpedoes from a military readiness standpoint this is foolish since lithium explodes in contact with moisture and discharges when shelfed giving the need to charge the battery before use whereas historically since the 50s the navy has relied on silverzinc or magnesiumsilver batteries which have indefinite shelf life thus military readiness because they are activated by the electrolytes in sea water or store their energy indefinitely lithium s military history has been used mainly for testing x200b so for the military to acknowledge a silver shortage and start to phase out for the inferior battery raises major concerns for the consumer economy and our national security between 198081 when the hunt brothers pushed the price to near $50 it caused 20 of consumer good manufacturing to drop off tiffany jewelry took out a front page ad in the new york times condemning the actions of the hunt brothers and it took the future exchanges calling an emergency meeting changing the rules and margin calling them while the govt started to sell parts of national strategic stockpile to tamp the price down where it remained low until the 2008 financial crisis and today x200b it should be noted that prior to the disclosure in the above document that the department of defense defense logistics agency stockpile was depleted and this happened for the first time in 2002 when we passed a bill that allowed the us mint to source silver on the open market for the first time but they are still obligated to may the average world price via 31 usc 5116 b 2 so for the military to be paying over spot is the definite sign that alarm bells should be ringing in everyone s mind here physical silver is scarce and its usages are vast within the military here so what about world wide has there been an incentive to suppress the price and no country dares to say anything for they risk not being able to afford to make war or build up their military as a deterrent from others to add insult to injury our country keeps giving away our silver wealth as a nation and creating a national security concern as our military readiness is at an all time low and now with lithium it may even become unreliable for our defense these are really concerns ladies and gentlemen that should be discussed x200b there s been prolific posts over the years but let me tell you the fact that our military is phasing out silver is the biggest red flag for investors that should be raised right now that s a future without xboxes or playstation or they become priced out of consumers hands the implications to the greater economy are major i want to sleep better tonight so i propose we drain the us mint because they lawfully have to mint american silver eagles to the demand of the public that law is 31 usc 5112 e whatever we demand they must supply it s time to call the bluff on the price of silver and use the us govt to do it for us i ll be buying 2023 american silver eagles it s gonna be a low mintage year at peak demand an effect of shortages for those that say well the govt will just not follow their own laws well to those i say then drama can commence and it will draw further awareness to this now blatant manipulation of the price this has the potential to halt the war in ukraine by draining the rest of the silver i truly believe in this moment this could save so many lives and help secure our nation even if it has to be the people who do it but least of all i see a true opportunity for generational wealth here

oxy calls have potential introduction hello everyone some of you may have seen my post last week about coinbase and since that turned out well for myself i figured fuck it why not do another smoothbrained crayon munching investment thesis this is not financial advice either i am a broke 21 year old college kid who eats crayons and sniffs glue in my past time this week is a much more boring thesis over occidental petroleum corporation they are a company that deals in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the following sections i hope to provide you all with something of substance over why you should or should not take an options position with oxy reason one bullish x200b above is a simple fiveyear chart of oxy s share price the reason i wanted to show this is simply because i would not be comfortable opening a bullish options position on an oil and natural gas stock at its all time high luckily this five year chart strokes my confirmation bias right where it hits different this is the weakest of my points by far but it makes me feel better knowing it traded near $90 a share in july 2018 additionally i am not worried about upside potential because the prolonged depression of share price was largely due to covid reason 2 bullish x200b our boy warren buffett just increased his stake within oxy significantly they bought another 59 million shares of oxy boosting their stake to roughly 152 he made these purchases on may 2nd and may 3rd in total berkshire owns 1423 million shares worth 88 billion dollars and additionally has another 10 billion of preferred stock they received in 2019 after helping to finance oxy s purchase of anadarko petroleum corp finally berkshire also has warrants to buy an additional 5 billion dollars of oxy shares at a discount source reason 3 bullish x200b above is a one year chart for wti crude oil as anyone with eyeballs can see crude oil has been on quite the absolute price pump this last year this should continue to bode well for oxy s share price especially in the short term as the low supply of crude oil weighs on the price per barrel in my opinion despite oil futures falling slightly this past week in the short term now to junejuly oxy should not have significant downside risk due to a falling price of oil this is because quite simply i do not see such a fall in price happening despite what i feel like is an incoming global recession that will lessen demand for oil i still believe demand will be robust enough to maintain current price levels for crude oil as concise as i can be things such as the ongoing russiaukraine war president biden s administration refusing to renew leases on public land for an increase in oil production the keystone pipeline still rolling in its grave and china finally easing up on the lockdowns they imposed on major cities such as shanghai and beijing will all contribute to a decreasing supply of crude oil and an increasing demand for crude oil source reason 4 bullish earnings are on 51022 after market close x200b above is a picture of oxy s earnings the last four quarters as well as what is expected going forward although past performance is not necessarily a perfect indicator for future performance to say the least i think it is incredible that oxy has beaten estimates for four consecutive earnings calls at this point x200b for those of you with big brains who like things quantified here are the exact numbers that ought to quell the anxiety felt when you are listening to some random degenerate on the internet drone on x200b the above picture shows eps is in a clear uptrend indicative of a company not only healthy financially but thriving likely to see continued growth x200b for those of you who would like to see the annual financials here they are some things to note that i personally see as positive indicators moving forward is most notably operating income it came in at $4 208 000 for eoy 2021 and had its second best oi of the last four years additionally nonrecurring expenses were virtually eliminated for 2021 which to me signals better financial management by the company and is likely to continue as this is a clear break from previous years with significantly higher nonrecurring expenses x200b currently oxy has a peg ratio of 021 as a general rule a peg ratio of 10 or lower suggests a stock is fairly priced or even undervalued a peg ratio above 10 suggests a stock is overvalued in other words investors who rely on the peg ratio look for stocks that have a pe ratio equal to or less than the company s expected growth rate sources where i could be wrong 1 oxy does not have an attractive pe ratio which could suggest it being overvalued industry average for oilgas production is 2773 and oxy has a pe ratio of 3950 source 1 anything that increases the current supply occurs more supply and less demand would not exactly bode well for an oil and gas stock for example the biden administration renews leases for oil and gas companies on public lands suddenly the russia ukraine war ends or exports begin to be accepted again from russia 2 anything that decreases demand occurs china goes and locks things down again decreasing demand for oil and natural gas consumer discretionary income decreases and as a result americans travel less 3 earnings doesn t go well 4 captain money printer decides to do a 75 basis point or greater rate hike at the june fomc meeting conclusion for the reasons above i am bullish on oxy for the next few months as a result i will be opening at least one call option at market open on monday may 9th tldr oil and natural gas are still having robust demand with continued supply issues that could widen the gap between demand and supply buffett has a rather large stake in oxy that he just increased this past week finally their financials are robust to say the least and they have beaten earnings expectations each of the last four quarters position oxy $65 c 617

unspoken risk with student loan payments resuming everyone is talking about unaffordability for discretionary items but i think there is a much greater risk bank runs if people pull their saved cash to apply to their student loans then this would create a bankrun like effect i have been stashing away money on the chance that biden failed to have student loans forgiven many of my friends have done the same our plan is to pull the money out and pay right before interest resumes you can apply the payment directly to the principal this way if 20 of outstanding student loans are paid offremoved from bank reserves won t this being like a bank run are the big us banks ready for half a trillion to be yanked from savings accounts i don t know the specifics of the last stress test but i would like to know people s take on this unspoken side of the risk

the boomer s bet 25 drop coming around march 2022 there was a post forecasting the action we d see before a 25 capitulation crash in dji and other us indices major indices could drop 25 in a week here s when why and how wallstreetbets redditcom x200b this was the forecast move in the dji to set up the trade from op here s the real chart outcome since that time x200b the boomer s bet would now imply dji is heading to 26 000 and spx is heading to 3 000 if these moves happened they d usually be in a capitulation style with the orderly selling part of the downtrend coming to an end and the memorable crash section getting ready to start if the boomer s model was correct this should be close to starting
am i regarded or is there a second big short for cre i will preface this by saying this is my first post here and i don t have a lot of trading experience at all so i d like you guys to walk me through my logic and point out any flaws i ve worked for banks the past two years basically reviewing models for loan valuation and one of my main take aways is that most market participants that sell lots of loans are basically all agreeing on prices which imply market risk is not that bad like using standard brownian motion for the market risk variance parameters then on top of that a lot of them add caps and floors to prices that are historically extreme that being said i ve heard recent horror stories on how cre is overvalued by like 3x the book price of many of the large banks does that mean we have a sort of schrdingers cat thing going on like once these banks decide to strategically default or try and sell these buildings every bank will realize they are solvent and if this logic makes sense why hasn t it happened yet like do policymakers and regulators somehow want to postpone the crash so they can try to prevent it so everyone agrees on bubbled prices finally any ideas on how we can all get rich off of this writing on the wall or is it totally regarded and if so why i know it s long winded i am just curious how this situation in the market will play out particularly with interest rates so high and student loans coming back

layman s reasoning for why tlt is overvalued note this is all oversimplified please correct me on the details i know tlt is not the same as a single 30year bond and has a shorter effective duration but the same fundamental concept about real total return applies tlt has a yield to maturity of 264 1 meaning if you were to buy and hold $100 of tlt for 30 years and just reinvest the dividends and assuming no taxes you d end up with roughly 1026430 100 $218 nominal in 2052 between 1970 and 2000 inflation eroded the purchasing power of the dollar by 774 2 assuming a similar path for inflation over the next 30 years which seems likely given the current debttogdp ratio your $218 pretax will buy you only 0226 218 $49 worth of goods and services in 2052 usually when you put money into an investment instead of spend it you expect it to give you a real return now maybe with a riskfree governmentguaranteed investment a zero real return is acceptable for anything significantly less than that free market participants would likely instead choose gold or silver which have for thousands of years maintained their purchasing power over long time frames another similar alternative is farmland assumption 1 at current prices tlt is giving a 50 total real return to maturity assumption 2 the natural total real return for bonds is 0 conclusion tlt is overvalued by a factor of roughly 2x and can fall by 50 just because something is a government bond doesn t make it a safe investment longterm gov bonds can lose a lot of value a 30year bond can be sold before maturity but there has to be a buyer you can t redeem a bond for its principal before maturity qe the fed has been buying these bonds off the private market for the past 2 years with printed money and driving up their prices with qe ending and qt starting no more infinite money printing buyer will backstop this asset the fed probably will not restart qe until inflation has cooled off significantly now you understand the tina argument no one wants to sit on these overvalued bonds the problem is there is always an alternative spending today on goods services or commodities many of which can have longterm value another is shortterm bonds which don t have the same exposure to inflation and finally paying off debt position tbt 2024 calls sources 1 2

nati acquisition and suspicious option activity i have been following $nati closely ever since emerson s hostile bid and the accompanying strategic review were disclosed in january emerson is bidding $53 a share up from an initial $48 offer and in response ni adopted a poison pill the majority shareholder and ni founder dr t with a 28 holding is in favor of the acquisition now nati has been hovering on the 5054 range ever since but i noticed an uptick in options volume today 6k for march 17 50c and 6k for march 17 50p it might be a dud or it might be an insider playing a straddle if it s a straddle is it long or short i would guess this is a long straddle expecting either a retracted bid sending nati $47 or the arrival of a new bidder for $53 both resulting in a profit the high breakeven is very close to the $53 announced bid however there is also the question of why would an insider play a straddle instead of picking a direction if heshe really knows something the pl for the straddle volume data what do you guys think positions 1 straddle just for the heck of it

when will the china uninvestable narrative end baba has nearly doubled from its lowest point all chinese stocks have been rallying to the moon two years ago china was not viewed as uninvestable little changed about the investment system in china it s still authoritarian vie structure the ccp can do what it wants it s always been this way yes short term crisis like the real estate bubble and tech crack down have occurred but china is mostly the same as it was 2 years ago i ve been pounding sand for months about the amazing opportunity china presents it was extremely undervalued even with risks considered now that i ve been proven right and china stocks are rocketing will people finally end this overly pessimistic fear mongering the choir will come out with the same tired points about how idiotic it is to invest in china as of now the naysayers have been proven wrong baba is performing wonderfully despite the noise i just want to know how much longer the sheep will keep avoiding china before they fomo in it s not too late to jump into chinas recovery this is only the beginning of a long rally back to fair value i know most commenters are going to berate me but to the few wise ones with open minds consider what the criticism argues vs the current price performance the share price completely contradicts this uninvestable narrative the bears were saying this same crap before asset prices nearly doubled china is going to experience a massive bull market rally don t follow the crowd and miss the boat
panw follow up for today first and foremost call buying and put selling were strong yesterday one thing i like to see here is they were primarily correlated that s a good sign for continuation as opposed to if one is flat and the other is in full control the dip at the end of the day did catch my attention i attribute it to some holders taking profits but i could be wrong as of last night s options positions at close panw was in a negative gamma range going up to the 315 strike then moves into positive gamma above that in case you don t know what that means when a stock is in negative gamma dealers are buying as it goes up and selling as it goes down they contribute to its movement positive gamma they sell when it goes up buy when it goes down so they serve to mute the stock movement we are at 317 premarket at the time of writing so that could have a softening effect on the stock s movement today it will largely depend on volume to overcome it and options volume could change this range dynamically during the day call wall moved up last night to 310 we are already above that premarket just like with positive gamma it could effect the stocks ability to move up today often these walls act like magnets pulling the stock towards them it will depend on volume and options activity today preferably i like to see call walls moving up ahead of the stocks price when the stocks price gets ahead of them i ve noticed it has a habit of jumping ahead and then trending back down each day we will see what happens today on the chart side this looks like it could be shaping up to be a healthy trend movements up with pullbacks and opportunities to get in if you aren t already wait for a pullback before jumping in overall the stock is solid good fundamentals sold off unnecessarily at a good earnings report and i don t think it has hit the level it needs to be at yet to find equilibrium overall i m still bullish i like the stock if i was getting in now i would wait for a pullback and look for calls out longer than this week to allow for it to move up retrace move up retrace etc
how an ukrainian oligarch betrays minority shareholders of kernel holding and destroys ukraine s image for foreign investors tldr ukrainian oligarch andriy verevskyi chairman and majority shareholder of kernel betrays minority shareholders and damages ukraine s reputation among foreign investors he used shady tactics to gain control of the company including diluting minority shares and forcing them to sell at a low price but some investors are taking legal action against verevskyi and pressure is mounting on the ukrainian government to address the situation he still does not have the needed 95 of voting shares to do a squeezeout because some investors resist to sell maybe they see a huge opportunity in kernel or just don t want to sell at such a paltry price ukrainian shareholders can t even sell their shares since the ukrainian stock market is frozen a few months ago there was a discussion in this sub regarding ukrainian agriculture stocks such as kernel holding after the beginning of the war the price dropped by over 60 since a few months the oligarch chairman of the board and majority shareholder andriy verevskyi tries to gain full control of the company at the cost of the minority shareholders and ukraine s image to achieve that he played a wellknown game with minority shareholders he diluted their share and actually forced them to sell their shares to him at a paltry price after announcing to delist kernel from the warsaw stock exchange and planning a squeezeout first verevskyi s company namsen limited offered all minority shareholders to buy out their shares at a price of only pln 185 with a capital of pln 100 per share at the same time the media reported that kernel would buy out all the shares from the minority shareholders next kernel announced its intention to withdraw from the wse this prompted people to sell shares for the very promised 185 zloty fearing to be left without money at all in addition large funds including pension funds are not allowed to own shares in companies that are not on the stock exchanges with that strategy verevskyi was able to get 74 of all shares through a buyout at an undervalued price in august it was decided to issue an additional $60 million worth of shares which were again bought back by verevskyi in september verevskyi issued shares at pln 116 and bought them back again in fact he gained control over 90 of kernel s shares and can almost withdraw from the warsaw stock exchange and do a squeezeout since he needs at least 95 of all votes now investor pavel boyko has united about 400 minority investors they are trying to protect their rights and prevent the destruction of the company s reputation this is a story first of all about the future of ukraine because while our military is winning on the front some businessmen are ruining the country from within because investments creation of factories rule of law without this ukraine will not be able to exist as a european country pavlo boyko he claims that ukraine defends the interests of ukrainian agrarians and sues countries that ban exports while at the same time the largest agricultural company actually destroys the image of ukraine after such situations it will be extremely difficult for foreign investors to regain confidence in ukrainian companies andriy verevskyi is already well known in ukraine a few years ago the parliament cut vat personally for his company on the back of record profits the oligarch as it turned out has a great influence at least on the legislative branch in ukraine and was a member of the ukrainian national parliament from 2012 to 2013 until the higher administrative court of ukraine revoked his mandate due to a conflict of interest but there is some hope 1 pavlo boyko and other minority shareholders try to sue the oligarch for his shady procedure 2 the pressure on the ukrainian government is growing among others from minority shareholders and poland because kernel holding was traded mainly in poland and was able to grow mainly thanks to polish investors many fear that the government s inaction will deter international investors in the future 3 verevskyinamsen ltd needs at least 95 of all voting shares to do a squeezeout but many investors refuse to sell their shares to namsen maybe they see a huge opportunity in kernel or justdon t want to sell at such a paltry price some aren t even able to do so such as ukrainians since the ukrainian stock market is frozen sources article of obozrevatel russian verison ukrainian version video of an ukrainian minority shareholder russian diskussion from a view months ago

going all in on $sbux i ll start off by saying no one gives a fuck about the genz boycott and it will have no effect on future operations or success of starbucks with that said i will continue to buy a shitton of $sbux with a decline of over 13 from its recent peak at $10721 sbux is currently trading at approx $94 per share at time of writing investors and myself believe $sbux is potentially undervalued considering factors such as its revenue growth operating margins and positive free cash flow in the previous quarter the company demonstrated robust financial performance marking an 11 yearoveryear increase in revenue the fullyear sales concluding on oct 1 2023 showed an 8 upswing propelled by strong comparable sales and a gapp operating margin surge from 142 to 182 compared to the preceding quarter another important note is that starbucks is now exhibiting a robust trend in generating free cash flow for the fiscal year ending oct 1 2023 it achieved an impressive $3675 billion in fcf a substantial uptick from the previous two years this translates to a noteworthy 102 fcf margin calculated based on its full fiscal year sales amounting to $35976 billion for the quarter ending oct 1 its free cash flow reached $1246 billion as per seeking alpha figures resulting in an increased fcf margin of 133 based on the quarterly revenue of $9377 billion considering analysts projections of $3953 billion in revenue for the year ending sept 30 2024 there s a potential for fcf to surge to $526 billion this year ie 133 x $3953b this represents a substantial 43 growth compared to the $3675 billion generated for the year ending oct 1 2023 in practical terms utilizing a 4 fcf yield metric equivalent to a 25 times multiple sbux could ascend to a market cap of $1315 billion ie 25x $526b presenting a 25 increase over the current market cap of $1054 billion in essence this suggests that sbux stock has the potential to appreciate by 25 reaching a projected price of $11445 per share even more if we all pitch in starbucks has a less than traditional financial funding model while not operating as a conventional bank the $16 billion outstanding gift card balances effectively function as interestfree loans from the customer base the retention of $196 million in unused gift card balances in 2022 highlights an unusual funding approach that allows $sbux to essentially free fundings in contrast to traditional banks starbucks operates outside the standard regulatory framework for holding customer funds in segregated accounts or lowrisk government bonds although starbucks card balances cannot be directly converted into currency and are limited to purchasing starbucks items this distinctive setup enables starbucks to utilize these funds strategically for company growth this unconventional approach provides starbucks the flexibility to pursue opportunities for expansion and operational improvements showcasing an innovative utilization of customer deposits that navigates around typical regulatory limitations this transformation positions starbucks as a financial player surpassing a substantial number of traditional banks in total assets accompanied by their added edge from the absence of stringent regulations regarding the storage of customer funds the starbucks card program contributing nearly half of the company s annual sales at around $10 billion underscores a shift in consumer behavior as customers opt for a streamlined app experience filled with rewards who doesn t love some free shit starbucks capitalizes on the sbux card balances redirecting them for corporate growth expansion initiatives and operational enhancements the unique structure of these funds which cannot be directly converted into currency provides starbucks with a financial advantage here is the renard version if you can t understand the above alright listen up fellow yolo enthusiasts so starbucks might not be your typical bank but let me tell you it s flexing with a jawdropping $16 billion in outstanding gift card balances that s like the ultimate interestfree loan hustle from its loyal customers and get this they re pocketing a cool $196 million from unused gift cards with around $10 billion yearly loading onto the starbucks card program it s practically driving almost half of their total sales forget credit cards now you just whip out the app snag some rewards and join the caffeinated tendie train starbucks playing in the big leagues has outshined most banks in assets we re talking 86 of us banks rocking less than a billion in assetscue starbucks sipping its frappuccino at the top no need to follow the boring bank rules starbucks isn t stashing your cash in some snoozefest bank account or lowrisk government bonds nah they re taking those sbux card funds can t swap em for cash and using them to fuel the company s rocket ship to the moon it s like they found a loophole turning your latte money into expansion opportunities this is

i notice again some things about oil maybe something that others can take advantage of i have a history on wall street and a rather detailed memory of the stock market and futures market back in the late 70 s to the 90 s i am not a boomer so let s take observable history and push it to the front to utilize 1972 1979 gas crisis fyi in high school 1983 i paid 168 per gallon and in 1999 i paid 96 per gallon in nj by the gw bridge some observable facts when gas prices double or max out at 225x that s a consumer peak not the peak of brent crude or wti or ny harbor i have always used normal average gas in the area so based on that in 1972 i saw dad fill up for 46 to 86 per gallon 197881 saw gas go from 79 to $223 and now i am seeing 2020 s low of 235 to a peak of 498 which i bought this week i m thinking in my area it will peak at 540ish i do have gas in my town at 575 but that s the highway ripoff place that makes 50 a gallon or more the spread is about 42 to 60 usually so to determine when people slow down driving look at the pumps prices that s your short term outlook good for 3 to 7 days next item oil and it s relationship the us government data is your best friend that s the main site enjoy it please observe the following in the last 10 years we have lost about 11 refineries and averaged 96 uptime we are now at 91 uptime with no new refineries being built each percentage point is about 100k barrels of processing per day we are at 400k idle right now when it comes to gas it seems that there is something weird going on we have less refineries and the same possible output or more of gasoline fuel yet what s being deliver to the jobberwholesalers is or about 10k barrels less weekly so with all this information presented i have come to a small but almost imperceptible observation there is a 3rd party gaming the system in which the rest are riding along similar to the copper cornering back in the mid 90 s by sumotomo corp it was a long game but failed good detailed read if you find it this is nothing like the hunt brothers and it s smell s similar to a late 80 s metal market collusion and the old nondelivery of potatoes in 70 s joke from the exchange ei some guy went to the delivery terminal walked a mile up the tracks and disconnected the train line or cause a derailment forcing nondeliver driving up the price thinking so so way out of the box with the data i can find this is possible for deep pockets if a proper traders could be told to buy and use slower delivery by using slower fuel pipelines this would seem to be natural this idea could be fully hedged and run automatically with an expert system i would not put it past anyone hope this helps
if you really want to get some not manipulated money just buy gold between 16001700 and hodl it until the end of 2023 or even further history is now repeating and like after the 2008 crisis gold will if you manage this trade successfully you will thank me later mmw and you re welcome this is something free from headache constantly being criticized for being slow to recognize inflation the federal reserve has embarked on its most aggressive series of rate hikes since the 80 s but in doing so its actions have dramatically strengthened the dollar raising concerns among leading economists that the us currency will be the next asset bubble to burst and now we can be in the right side of it and get the best profit out of it so i m giving you this tip before it s too late now the prices are going up and down between that levels and the best opportunitie is now the fed will soon follow in the bank of england and start printing money to inject massive liquidity and we re already in a super inflationary environment so all the data points the same gold will soon fly to the moon a friendly reminder now if you re one of those traders who just trade based on technical analysis that will not work now in the gold market that is what the big monster want you to do to eat all your money so that s it hope you be able to do things right and i will be here to celebrate all your profits

psa housing will go down next so i ve been thinking about buying a house but i got recently faked out by the stock market you see i figured i might as well keep buying the sp 500 because stonks only go up right jpow is bae and bears r fuk right wrong as you know from literally the first trading day of 2022 the stock market and bond market have been getting crushed suddenly bears are having a field day and jpow is suddenly hawkish and fuck your puts has become fuck your calls what happened i still don t know the fed giveth and fed taketh away anyway so i m thinking about buying a house right but i m like nope i m not going to get faked out again by mr market so i do a little bit of research and find the following in q2 of 2020 the median sale price of a house in the us was $332 600 fast forward to q1 of 2022 and the median sale price of a house in the us is now $428 700 this represents a 289 increase in home sale prices in just under two years that has never happened before chat below for those who like pictures 28937 this isn t doom and gloom but i sure as hell won t be buying the top of the housing market like i did the stock market suddenly i m not feeling so bullish anymore so this means it s probably the bottom for the stock marketbut housing will still see a correction i m not thinking housing prices collapse but i see a 20 correction as highly likely reasons same as the stock market too much liquidity which is now being taken away demand destruction through higher interest rates sellers who were chasing the trend last year but are now like oh fuck how am i going to pay for this i need to sell now fewer qualified buyers because of higher costs of borrowing and lack of liquidity again i don t see a credit crisis or a collapse of the housing system not gonna happen but a 20 correction after a monumental 29 rally yeah most likely gonna happen tldr don t buy a house just yet unless you enjoy seeing red in your portfolio temporary correction in housing will be incoming soon just like every other market that has taken it on the chin this year

sofi caught in the fud perhaps unfairly i want to preface this by saying i m absolutely fucking regarded and have lost most of the money i ve ever had on tesla and spy puts during the greatest bull run of all time that said maybe i ve learned something since then and have been closely following the advice of my wife s boyfriend and would like to propose my thesis and get some feedback the hot topic this month is regional banks sus bank stocks in general are getting crushed and many deservedly so but i believe this fud is spilling into some relatively healthy banks providing a long opportunity sofi recently reported earnings and they killed it they are growing rapidly with a healthy balance sheet and a generally wellliked product despite their best the stock was beat down 25 in 2 days as they revealed a large portion of their lending portfolio is devoted to personal loans svb went under cause they held a bunch of shit low interest bonds that weren t worth enough to cover their massive deposit loss many creheavy regional banks are now getting fucked in the ass cause a lot of that real estate sits vacant and there are worries that with interest rates continuing to rise people will default on those loans sofi to me avoids both of those risks regarding the first they are experiencing terrific deposit growth and the loans they carry pay high interest regarding the second the real estate concerns seem mostly unrelated to the ability of their average 749 fico loan recipients ability to pay their loans there is risk but their balance sheet is healthy and they are well diversified across different financial products as a slight piece of confirmation sofi is currently up a tiny bit on a day that many bank stocks are being cut in half maybe this is an indication that the market is realizing they are in a different situation i want you all to shit on me and tell me why i m wrong so i don t lose the rest of my wife s boyfriend s money and again you probably shouldn t listen to me food for thought
tmus ridiculous valuation it s been hovering at ath 122 pe while verizon and att single digit pes title says it anyone have an opinion on tmus seems so obviously overvalued so i assume i m missing something what am i missing i know they merged with sprint and supposedly have a lead on 5g listening to their ceo it sounds like they re hyper focused on their numbers and comparing themselves to competitors which in a way makes me suspicious like they need to tell us how great they are rather than letting their performance speak for itself ath seems a bit exaggerated here thoughts
22423 inflation commentary the fed has the ability to create a recession but is it the smart thing to do powell has stated many times that he can quelch demand with rates but can he the underlying problem powell has is one of bifurcation and a tax and spend policy that is disproportionately altering the direction of money velocity toward areas with tax credits spending artificially or demand created by the government and it is not organic the bifurcation lies in that spending is two pronged and on side you have essential needs which is organic spending and then you have the want spending which is i buy not out of necessity but simply because i can afford it the new min corporate tax of 15 and the wage increases are built in layers of cost that necessarily create a higher cogs cost of goods sold you want to tame inflation it will be essential to remove the tax credits that cater to the want spending inflation at the organic spending level is being impacted by the tax and spend policy money supply is analogous to a pond of water the water is symbolic of the money and this money is labored for and the laborer must have essentials to live the problem is that the government takes part of this income from the laborer and redistributes it to the want side of the spending crowd who are buying things other than essentials i would personally prefer that all of the tax credit be reallocated towards healthcare which is also essential medicare for all so i am a capitalist and if i had my way we would pay for all spending with a national sales tax as opposed to an income tax which harms the essential spenders in favor of redistribution to the want spenders hence the word bifurcation essential versus want

elon musk on twitter buyout myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for it but the longterm value of twitter is an order of magnitude greater than its current value elon musk gave a strong indication today that his purchase of twitter is indeed on track in a reference to the tortured deal not via tweet but towards the tail end of an earnings call for tesla he said the social media platform he s looking to acquire by a courtimposed oct 28 deadline is currently overvalued but has incredible potential although obviously myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for twitter right now the longterm potential for twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value the billionaire tesla founder said after the electric automaker s quarterly results he called twitter an asset that has sort of languished for a long time i am excited about the twitter situation he said musk agreed to buy the company in april for $44 billion or $5420 a share but walked away from the deal in july twitter sued in delaware chancery court followed by a blizzard of legal filings and some acrimonious hearings as markets tanked this spring and summer musk started disparaging the company shortly after he agreed to buy it at one point saying the deal was on hold but with a trial date set for oct 17 musk reversed course again early this month and agreed to the transaction at the original price the judge stayed the trial and gave his camp until oct 28 to close elon musk says on his twitter twtr buyout deal that him and his investors are obviously overpaying for it but believes the long term value of twtr is greater than its current value do you think musk will buy twtr by october 28 deadline and avoid the trial

beware of bbby shit post price targets the goal posts are already moving you ve probably already seen the posts on here over the weekend with bbby price targets getting higher and higher now in the thousands i honestly feel like a grad student could write a thesis on the seven stages of squeeze as all these squeezes seem to roll out in the same way i would say we are currently at stage three the moving of the goal posts this happens every time the stock gets some momentum and suddenly the price targets people would have been fully stoked to get suddenly seem like poultry gains in comparison to the 100x price targets anons start to shit post on here if i had any advice it is this stick with that original price target you would have been fully stoked to get before you read all those 100x shit post price targets i can unfortunately say from multiple experiences that bagging your original price target even if you don t sell at the exact top is so much better that watching the price crater under your original price target because you got greedy and held to long bring on the accusations of me being a shill it only makes me stronger the truth is that a lot of those price target shit posters are the ones shilling you as they want you to hold your position for as long as possible so the price runs up and they can sell at their own price target which is lower than the one they were shit posting about some of you may recognize me from my own shit posting hobby on the daily threads i m not a shill i m just a guy that could be a hell of a lot richer during gme if i didn t let anons convince me the big money was going to let the price go to $1000 a share which became my price target unfortunately i loaded up on some positions i believe in so i don t have a lot of money in bbby 134 shares $674 wish i had more but i m up like 100 so that s chill and no i won t tell you what my price target is not looking to add to the cacophony of guesses pick your own price target and stick to it regards

$tsla elon musk s antics turn owners and wouldbe buyers against tesla elon musk s antics turn owners and wouldbe buyers against tesla ira boudway and kyle stock sat july 30 2022 at 900 am bloomberg dennis levitt got his first tesla a blue model s in 2013 and loved it it was so much better than any car i ve ever driven the 73yearold selfstorage company executive says he bought into the brand as well as elon musk tesla inc s charismatic chief executive officer purchasing another model s the following year and driving the first one across the country in 2016 he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban los angeles home to be one of the first to order two model 3s one for himself the other for his wife i was a total musk fanboy levitt says was because while levitt still loves his teslas he s soured on musk over time his public statements have really come to bother me levitt said citing the ceo s spats with us president joe biden among others he acts like a sevenyearold before it was reported musk had an affair with sergey brin s wife which he s denied before his slipshod deal then nodeal to acquire twitter inc before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his braininterface startup neuralink before spacex fired employees who called him a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns before an article said spacex paid an employee $250 000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her allegations he s called untrue musk s behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some tesla owners the trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another tesla commands high brand awareness consideration and loyalty and customers are mostly delighted by its cars musk s antics on the other hand they could do without creative strategies a californiabased customerexperience measurer mentioned owner frustration with musk in a study it published in april a year earlier research firm escalent found musk was the most negative aspect of the tesla brand among electricvehicle owners surveyed we hear from tesla owners who will say look i love my vehicle but i really wish i didn t have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet says mike dovorany who spoke with thousands of ev owners and potential buyers during his two years working in escalent s automotive and mobility group tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through musk s many controversies the dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with covid lockdowns in shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the ev sales ranks musk s star power built in no small part by his activity on twitter the same forum where he s become such a lightning rod has contributed immensely to tesla especially since it s shunned traditional advertising his steady stream of online banter punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt see shooting a roadster into space keeps tesla in the headlines during the company s earlier days the trolling and glib comments were a feature not a bug they allowed musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for tesla s legion of veryonline fans but after making tesla and himself so synonymous with one another musk has waded into political conflicts attempted to buy one of the world s most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life putting the company s increasingly valuable brand at risk stay on top of the electric car revolution by signing up to our hyperdrive newsletter here jerry james stone a 48yearold chef in sacramento california who teaches his 219 000 youtube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals drives a volkswagen beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car he isn t sure yet which model but certain it won t be a tesla elon has just soiled that brand for me so much that i don t even think i would take one if i won one stone says you have this guy who s the richest dude in the world who has this huge megaphone and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who s not or to fatshame people all these things that are just kind of gross according to strategic vision a us research firm that consults auto companies some 39 of car buyers say they wouldn t consider a tesla that s not necessarily out of the ordinary almost half of respondents say they won t consider german luxury brands but tesla does lag more massmarket brands toyota for example is only off the shopping list for 23 of drivers emma sirr a 28yearold worker in cloud computing who lives in bozeman montana gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 nissan frontier they ve been researching evs for about three years and until recently considered teslas the only viable option given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area but they refused to buy one because of musk their main gripes being his politics staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomousdriving technology we took tesla off the table from the getgo sirr says she and her partner have their eyes on the kia niro and chevrolet bolt as possible alternatives as consumers our power is what we buy i think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets and i feel like that might come back to bite for much of the past decade tesla lacked competitors that matched its models battery range and other measures of performance consumers put off by musk s mischief had few evs to turn to as legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models tesla won t have as much leeway we ve seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary says dovorany who left escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year we re not seeing that as much with incoming buyers to win this cohort automakers need to check every box and for some that includes employing a ceo who doesn t share hilter memes on social media levitt the selfdescribed former musk fanboy took a test ride last month in a lucid he wasn t sold on it partly he says because it didn t have enough cargo space for his golf gear he s still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from tesla and considering models from audi mercedes and bmw if you take mr musk and his antics out of the equation i m about 98 certain that my next car would be a tesla levitt says his antics put me in play
elon musk wont succeed in buying twitter short twitter via may 13 44 puts sorry for clickbait title nothing against musk but he cannot succeed in buying out twitter twitter will remain a public company that status quo will continue as it has been republicansconservatives will downvote me into oblivion cry and whine about free speech blah blah but feelings facts thesis the takeover attempt of twitter will fail completely whether its through a complete buyout or or a proxy war over the board furthermore there will not be any other entities that are willing to offer an alternative buyout that twitter will accept as a result the twitter stock price will plummet back down to 30s before musk began buying shares puts are the winning strategy argument 1 poison pill shareholder rights plan will make it nearly impossible for musk or a consortium to gain control over the board the moment musk or a consortium reaches 15 ownership of the company all other shareholders will have the right to buy discounted shares of twitter the result is that the acquiring group will constantly have their shares diluted and the entire attempt will become exorbitantly expensive indeed poison pills are very effective at preventing even the attempt of a hostile takeover argument 2 musk s 5420 buyout offer is too cheap companies of this size generally don t consider any offer lower than their 52 week high twitter has hired goldman sachs to advise them in this matter apparently goldman sachs believes that the offer is too low to be considered additionally the decision by twitter to adopt a poison pill almost surely implied that twitter also believes the offer is too low they will not accept a bid of 5420 to entice the board to sell the company musk and co or some other firm will need to offer a significantly higher premium a lot closer to the 52 week high of $70 argument 3 in theory musk probably could afford to buy twitter at a price the board cannot refuse but is he willing to do so musk doesn t have enough liquid assets to do this immediately he would have to liquidate the equivalent of his entire stake in spacex to come up with 45 billion dollars to put it another way is musk willing to give up spacex to buy twitter my guess is probably not the fact that musk is already talking about getting other people on board with him suggests that he is unable to or not willing to foot the bill conclusion twitter will not be bought out by musk therefore the logical thing to happen is for twitter to fall back down to the 30s disclaimer my position holding may 13 $44 strike puts worth approximately 1000 dollars if i had more money i d invest more screenshots are proof of my position not investment advice do your own due diligence
take this volume to newegg remember when newegg said they were going to start doing build your own pc s and with volume alone sky rocketed like 500 in a day the stock goes nuts with just a little volume if even half of the folks here just moved over there as a collective everyone could easily double their money at least on just volume alone no short squeeze no dumb dark pool magic bullshit just volume the volume is so low right now most contracts aren t even trading and to top it all off it s actually a decent company not some bankrupt archaic shack hanging on by a thread and right now it s less than half the price of when it reverse ipo d in 2021 so even if everything failed to make it spike it s still going to go up in the long run it s currently at under 4 bucks a share i honestly think it s worth at least 10 we ve seen is shoot to 50 on a weak catalyst imagine what a bombardment could do i said my peace not financial advice very regarded

the federal reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet mars data going back to 1896 proves it the mars hypothesis by anthony of boston presents the idea that the federal reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet mars in this book data going back to 1896 shows that as of april 2020 percentagewise the dow jones rose 857 when mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896 the dow rose 136 when mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node the dow rose 721 mars retrograde phases during the time mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node the purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the federal reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet mars but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time formulate a system that would enable the federal reserve to carry out its application in real time using the observation of the planet mars the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098

the fed saying we aren t in recession is ultra hawkish don t misinterpret it ok listen up you charming sociable well adjusted smoothbrains a lot of people on here are talking about the upcoming fed announcement that we aren t in recessions which is almost certainly what they will say at this point given they are already telegraphing it and assuming they are being falsely positive and playing the political cover game this is the wrong way to think about this let s walk through their decision tree the ultimate end action is the rate hike and the quantity of balance sheet roll off the fed jawboning we aren t in recession has absolute no actual consequences it just shows you how they are positioning for the hikes and the roll off so if they come out and say we are in a depression society is collapsing what action comes after that they drop back to zero percent rates that s what the fed being dovish looks like but they are saying the economy is rock solid and it doesn t need any help this is just positioning to keep railing on the rate hikes x200b don t read too much else into it the fed doesn t decide if we are actually in a recession the nber does all this is is jawboning about the policy direction on wednesday sorry to disrupt your daily session of licking paint chips up off the floor

it s time to long the vix $vixy supporting thesis tldr i believe that the vix and the contracts that govern its effectiveness for use as a hedge have been manipulated into suppression however i believe we are about to reach a critical turning point in which the rusted gears begin turning again mechanisms vixtraded products are not all that they seem and many investors already know this when you buy into products like $vxx and $vixy you are not directly buying into the price of the vix index but into a basket of funds that are designed to track futures and derivatives pricing ultimately these products are driven by putcall ratios meaning that when volatility within these products increases a compounding effect occurs that further exacerbates moves of the vix this requires the use of the vix as a hedge product with so many other products in the market being promoted as hedges against market collapses ie etfs hedged downside basket funds etc vixrelated products appear as if they are no longer the kings of hedges historically when the market falls suddenly the vix spikes so why is this not happening during the enormous swings in prices we are seeing today and is it dead the simple answer is no it is absolutely not dead but it has been beaten down by expectations reasoning the fed is attempting to act proactively to prevent a collapse within the market and investors are buying into this narrative the current market is reflecting confidence that what is coming will be bad but not catastrophic firms love buying into the narrative because it offers justification to buy more products that ensure investors that they are still capable of utilizing funds to generate profits after all who would want to invest with a firm that refuses to provide any risk in the hopes of generating potential gains for its consumers that s no fun there have been subtle signs over the past year that corroborate the idea that there is a sleeping giant who is being poked repeatedly by the fed and investors firms that create vix products have a better understanding of this than anyone else for example back in march barclay s suspended the creation of new notes of its vxx product decoupling it from its underlying there could be a wide range of reasons for this but i believe that the vix analysts viewed future market conditions as being so volatile that the losses incurred on the product would exceed the amount of cash on hand to cover the trades made below is also a historic chart of how the vix operates in relation to the sp 500 x200b as you can see a notable peak can be seen similar to that of 2020 which i understand was an odd year with unprecedented market conditions however i will also include a volatilityofvolatility chart to exemplify current volatility pricing x200b volofvol represents the demand for vix calls and it is plummeting at some point in the near future i expect a floor to be hit and the trend to reverse dramatically as other hedges prove inefficient or unsustainable i believe that firms will fall back to the most reliable historic hedge in modern times this will begin the gamma reversal that is to be expected in this type of environment not necessarily by shorts but by options traders or lack thereof by put traders as calls flood in i expect $vixy to profit the most summary the vix is undervalued at its current price as the market seems to maintain the everything is priced in mindset however market crashes are rarely ever predictable events as they rely on shady uninformed or straightup illegal trading methods firms banks and companies are attempting to remain profitable at any cost and i believe the ultimate price will be the solvency of the market at least for a brief period of time this brief period of time however is exactly where the vix excels i am long $vixy but as of writing this on 07262022 i do not hold any options on this product i do not have access to information necessary to determine dates and times or have been able to find useful financial statistics that would provide damning evidence of fraud or which aspect of the market it is prevalent in i am confident that fraud is permeating the entirety of the market though and taking my long position in $vixy i am accumulating positions for the event i am sure will happen in the near term these products are extremely volatile and can subject their investors to drastic losses do your own research and analysis trust your gut good luck references contributor chuck saletta the motley fool nd what is a gamma squeeze nasdaq retrieved july 26 2022 from the last bear standing 2022 may 27 the volatility squeeze part 3 the volatility squeeze part 3 retrieved july 26 2022 from squeeze part3 schwabcom nd vix etfs the facts and risks schwab brokerage retrieved july 26 2022 from

anybody buying the zendesk 77 dollar call options yoooo zendesk is apparently being taken private at 775 per share by hellman and friedman before 12312022 i read online that a form 25 has to be filed with us securities regulator sec within 60 days of the first issue of proxy soliciting materials for voting on matters related to the buyout this form certifies that the stock will be delisted by the exchange upon completion of the merger on september 02 zendesk published the first round of proxy soliciting materials the deal was then approved by zendesk shareholders during a meeting on september 19 the form 25 was now most likely has already been filed around november 02 the form 25 won t be made available to the public or be considered valid unless zendesk issues a press release indicating completion of the deal and that the exchange has received evidence of a certificate of merger from zendesk upon all conditions being satisfied the exchange removes the listing 10 days after the form 25 becomes public in 90 days the sec nullifies the registration of the securities if zendesk were to go public in the future it would be assigned a new cusp id when a stock gets delisted as a result of a company going private options are cash settled for the difference between the buyout price and the strike price given that deals tend to be completed within a week of the form 25 being drafted and confidentially submitted to the sec are you guys willing to risk $5 to buy 77 dollar call options expiring 11112022 in anticipation of the deal closing next week x200b tldr zendesk is incorporated in delaware according to sec filings if the status changes to an l consolidated the transaction has went through zendesk apparently has a charitable foundation and the status for their charitable organization will likely change from good standing to m merged the same day zendesk inc changes their status from good standing to l consolidated file number entity name 5606971 zendesk charitable foundation 4661237 zendesk inc it apparently costs 20 dollars each time i want to refresh the status of the entity and to check their filing history changing the status of a company from good standing to merged takes about 23 weeks apparently or 24 hours if expedited services are requested after getting the certificate of merger between zendesk charitable and zendesk inc the company needs to pursue a certificate of consolidation to create a new holding company when all the documents are prepared they are sent to the company through snail mail if you are checking the site for real time updates clicking on the link of a consolidated company will likely cause you to be redirected to the original search page if you click on any one of the corporations and the unofficial certificate of good standing fails to load the company s status has also been changed to consolidation a potential merger arbitrage will be available since return mail does take at least 1 day if you are still not sure whether the status of the company has changed live chat is available to enquire about a company s status mondayfriday 830 am 400 pm x200b edit if you guys are unsure about the timeline of the filing take a look at stonemor a publicly traded funeral company that just went private the deal was completed only two days after shareholders voted to approve the deal that means the company was able to have the certificate of merger and certificate of consolidation processed at the same time all within a 24 hour time period due to expedited services after the 24 hour turnover the state of delaware immediately mailed all items to the company however due to the additional 24 hour turnover of express mail the company was required to wait 1 additional day before they were able to notify the exchange to begin delisting procedures as mentioned above you would need to have a physical copy of the certificates in order to submit proof to the exchange that the deal has went through this 1 day difference can mean a lot when you are trading cheap 77 dollar call options

tesla engineering hq i don t see any real driver to the tsla stock from this besides ai hype and possible new debt to buy the old hp building if sentiment about chatgpt continues to drive the market narrative it probably continues on a tear maybe it just goes up bc there s more conversation about the company i can t find anything about them taking on more debt to buy it but i assume they will take a loan at an elevated interest rate and an expensive location seems like cutting margins taking on more expensive debt and a weakening consumer and elevated interest rates will cause pain for the stock does anyone have an opinion on what impact this news could have

what determines a recession two gdp decline within the same year or does low unemployment also play a factor my thing is though how does any of these makes sense recession inflation employment rate so what they re saying is there s correlation with unemployment and recession but here we are more jobs and low unemployment rate so more people are working more jobs created dollar values goes down we have more items in stock vs being sold but prices are still going up i mean it s not like we re fighting for a very rare pokmon card that s going for 5 million dollars

dd ape to amc arbitrage play reposted for the third time because apparently certain combinations of roman numerals in my headings are banned tickers and automod is a ruthless unforgiving god x200b regards my fellow regards based on the posts from this past week the beautiful bull has reared his head once again and people around here have finally made some money again with towelll stock company welldeserved congrats to you degenerates i m here to help everyone keep the ball rolling and talk about something that is very underrated on reddit let s be real this sub hasn t had any real dd in almost exactly two years i m here to fix that also before i lose you while this is about a meme stock this is not that hedgies are fuk bag holder bullshit where i screech over how ken g is going to jail couldn t care less about that what follows is honesttojordanbelfort arbitrage finance ever seen that weird memey ape thing trading on the markets since august well amc wants to have a vote to convert them to common stock and this is probably gonna make a huge return for those brave or stupid enough to join me read on and i will spell everything out for you intro amc trade history how the shares actually get converted what i have calculated the voting shares to be my analysis of how i think the vote will turn out handsdown the most crucial part and how exactly that will make you lots of money so sit down and imagine nicole kidman forcefeeding this dd down your throat a clockwork orangestyle i intro basically gme s ugly little sister who smells like musty cloth seats has a ceo greasier than the fake butter that they put on their $10 popcorn in an actual stroke of brilliance seriously no sarcasm adam aron aa realized that the meme wave that smashed over the market gave amc a valuation way higher than it deserved and he started to dilute the fuck out of anyone dumb enough to be a bag holder by selling more and more shares at the pumped valuation this reallllly helped amc s finances unfortunately for aa amc s pesky foundational corporate documents got in the way and eventually he wasn t able to sell any more shares because the common share count 516m started to get within pissing distance of the authorized share count 524m for those of you who have not suffered through a corporate law class the first number getting bigger than the second number is a big nono so big in fact that you literally cannot exceed it unless you beg your shareholders to raise the ceiling which if they have a brain they usually won t because that means further dilution in aa s infinite wisdom his finance department cooked up a frankenstein s monster of a security amc preferred equity units apes in brief they are almost exact clones of the common shares that aa could no longer dupe off on people they just aren t common shares they even gave out nfts to their shareholders in connection with this you can t make this shit up here is the exact description from the presser the company has applied to list its amc preferred equity units on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol ape starting august 22 2022 and each amc preferred equity unit is designed to have the same economic and voting rights as one share of common stock most importantly for us as you just read they have identical voting and economic rights dividends n shit to the common to distract shareholders from the obvious amc tells the public that this is just a normal new security that they will use to do ma activity and also to retire high interest debt not a bad idea tbh they issue these ape units in a 11 dividend to all common stockholders in august 2022 and so the printing press spins up as those of you who can read and are mildly financially literate may know the value of apes tanked as they sold more and more and they traded down from $78 at the time of issue to around $060ish this past december then comes the announcement from amc that they actually want to have a shareholder vote to convert the apes to common shares have the shareholders vote to increase the authorized share count and also do a 101 reverse split this last one does not matter so i am going to leave that there what this means is that you guys can take a 10 minute break from throwing shit on each other at the zoo and buy apes because as my dd will show below there is a very solid chance that this conversion vote goes through and the apes with their perpetual trading discount to common are suddenly about to become a lot more valuable ii amc history amc was founded in kansas in haha just fucking with you we don t care about that history here we care about the other stuff that leads us to our long ape trade as alluded to above amc was not really a great company for a very long time it used to be public then it got bought by china now it s public again whatever all you need to know is that what was once a $35 stock in 2016 got pummeled all the way down to a penny stock 250 of them to be exact by the dip of kovid then our sweet bagholders will remember the stock rallies 3 000 from its kovid low and everyone and their mother buys in after that they trade downward again we run into our problem about no more common shares to issue apes are born etc here we are iii can the shares even convert from ape to common because i hate myself i spent the last week reading through every single sec filing and amc press release since the inception of apes in august like patrick bateman clearly my only human emotions are greed and disgust anyways their august 4 2022 form 8a filing gives us the goods to provide for the authorization of a sufficient number of authorized and unissued and unreserved shares of the common stock into which the preferred stock and by virtue of such conversion amc preferred equity units can convert in full the company may seek to obtain the requisite stockholder approval at such time or times as the board of directors in its sole discretion shall determine under delaware law the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority in voting power of the company s outstanding capital stock will be required for stockholder approval of the common stock amendment the holders of the amc preferred equity units will be entitled to vote on the common stock amendment did you see that mr krabs amc in its infinite voterigging wisdom is letting apes vote at the same power as common in the very vote that allows ape holders to get the more expensive common shares at the expense of the commons brilliant they are doing this because the last time they tried to raise the ceiling for common shareholders got so mad they got the ceo to back down and remove the proposition 900m new votes should help change that coincidentally for us hhis is how we are going to make the money but how many shares are there iv a little math maybe even a bit more than caroline ellison used at alameda here is the part where your eyes glaze over and you let the more savant regards do the heavy lifting while you regards dream of tendies too bad read this so you learn something first we count the number of common shares each of which get 1 vote per share looking at both factset and capiq it s like yahoo finance but for smart people who actually pay money for things we know for a fact that the number of outstanding common shares is 516 820 595 this is also in some of their boring sec filings that i read and i won t bother to link them here because we both know you won t click on them calculating the ape share count was a bit trickier to do this i had to bust out some good old simple addition and again read a ton of press releases first you have the apes from the original 11 dividend in august 516 820 595 same amount as the common shares out then amc tells us in a december 19 press release that from august to that point in time they sold another 125 900 000 apes we don t know to who but probably to institutions is my guess where it gets interesting is the press release three days later on december 22 in that doc the same one where they announce the conversion vote from apes to common amc lets us know that it immediately sold 60 000 000 apes to hedge fund antara capital in addition to that sale a ton of promises are exchanged yes i know put promises in one pocket and shit in another and see which is heavier at the end of the day but promises mean things on fancy contract paper and they were as follows antara promises to buy 106 595 106 more apes and also promises to retire $100m of highinterest amc debt that it owns in exchange for another 91 026 191 apes these promises are subject to an antitrust legal waiting period which google tells me is about thirty days if you need it thirty days after december 22 is january 22 so in about a week or two all of this shit is memorialized in a forward purchase agreement which is just a ton of promises between companies in a contractual form i read that beast too and i found another very interesting set of promises amc promises to antara that it will hold the conversion vote within 90 days of the agreement date so that gives us a date of march 22 and antara promises to amc that it will hold all its shares for at least that period and will vote affirmatively in the conversion vote interesting relevant forward purchase agreement language can skip this part if you want and also find it on the sec s database for stock filings b purchaser lockup during the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the earlier of i 90 days after the date hereof provided that such period shall be extended by 1 day for each day that the notice form is not filed after the date hereof or ii the special meeting date as defined herein the lockup period the

within 90 calendar days of the date hereof the special meeting date provided however that such time period shall be extended by 1 day for each day that the notice form is not filed after the date hereof provided further that the company intends to postpone the special meeting if the closing has not occurred before the date of the special meeting g voting the purchaser hereby agrees that in connection with the special meeting the purchaser shall vote or cause to be voted the purchased apes and any additional apes and common stock owned or controlled either directly or indirectly by the purchaser or any purchaser parties in favor of the common stock amendment assuming that all of these trades actually do happen like the press releases say this gives us the following ape share count 516 820 595 august 11 dividend 125 900 000 issues through dec 19 60 000 000 immediate antara purchase on dec 22 106 595 106 antara purchase jan 22 91 026 191 antara debt exchange jan 22 900 341 892 apes to check my math and make sure i read all the public pressers and sec filings right i thought i would reach out to amc s handydandy vp of investor relations funny enough he told me to go pound sand and cited a sec regulation that doesn t apply here reg fd if you care which bars selective disclosure of material nonpublic information to analysts i was just asking for all the public info he had but congrats on the official sounding dodge to actually having to do your job need to find out some of those for my boss if you are still here this means that there are 516 820 595 common votes and 900 341 892 ape votes that are floating around in our wonderful shareholder democracy of over 14 billion votes common has 365 of the voting power and apes hold 635 i guess we are witnessing the rise of the planet of the apes because it s looking like it s sure as shit that the apes are going to crush the common shareholders in the conversion vote but can we tell who owns what shares v trying to figure out the retail institution ownership split for common and apes this may also sound boring to you but this is the most important part of the whole dd this is because the apes have a huge incentive to vote and they want to because they are voting to convert all their low value shares into high value shares the common shares are less likely to want this to happen because it means more future dilution most likely because aa wants a much higher authorized share count though he hasn t yet given us an exact number however commons are kinda in a weird place because i bet a lot of them still hold onto the apes that they got in the first distribution supported by my perusal of their online gathering places today where i saw a lot of the users bragging about still holding them they too probably want those to go up in value so i think incentives here are more conflicted and muddy and voting will be all over the place the other important piece is the whole retail vs institutions divide in a popcorn shell institutions vote a hell of a lot more than retail does and in a semiefficient market like ours the greater the spread between ape and common share price the more incentivized a hedge fund or other player swoops in to buy up shares to vote in favor of the conversion industrywide analysis by broadridge shows that retail usually owns 31 of shares and of those shares they vote 29 of them on the other hand institutions own about 69 of shares nice and they vote 82 of what they own link not posting but you can just google broadridge shareholder voting report 2022 and get it looking specifically to amc unfortunately i wasn t able to find any voting records for after the creation of apes however i did find this june 16th 8k that detailed how the common voted in the 2022 annual meeting 2688m of 5168m shares were present or represented by proxy 520 and 1450m shares were voted after excluding broker nonvotes 281 so pretty much in line with market averages pulling from factset again i get the ownership split of about 5 institutional and insider ownership and 95 retail this is not normal for normal companies but i guess for a meme stock it makes a bit more sense relying on some assumptions then i tweaked this ownership split for the first 11 ape dividend in august just a bit assuming that some smart money is in on the play and is buying apes so 90 went to retail and 10 to insiders and institutions just gonna call that group institutions from here on out after that if we take aa on his word that apes were mostly for high interest debt exchanges and ma then the overwhelming majority of later ape tranches should have gone to institutions assumed a 925 take for institutions i made an excel for myself to play with it but i m not going to share the full doc here you can take my word for it or make your own if you want to flex assumptions lastly before we get on to my vote prediction model note that per amc s certificate of incorporation 50 of the total voting stock not shares present but actually shares in existence has to approve of raising the ceiling for authorized shares which is what we need to do here for our purposes this means the affirmative votes have to exceed about 708 million check this x200b how the turn tables now it looks like retail controls 69 of the vote nice and hedge fund bros barely have a pot to piss in with 31 of the voting power fear not little bros like all of you losers do in our real democracy retail never shows up to vote applying a base case scenario of the same voting rates that usually happen in the market with a bit of extra juice for institutions since so much money is to be made and a 20 pop in retail voting which includes auto votes from brokers who will likely vote yes because proxy advisors will very likely recommend affirmative votes per broadridge s analysis of voting averages x200b we see that affirmative votes absolutely beat down negative votes by a 8020 margin now let s talk a hell scenario where retail vote turnout increases by 30 so spikes from 50 to 65 and they get all pissy for whatever reason and vote against this proposal 41 x200b conversion still wins and with a margin better than any president in the last 40 years talk about a mandate we could monte carlo this but if we are passing even in the bad scenario then we should feel pretty good about this bet again this place is wall street bets not main street invests now that we know the vote is likely to pass what will happen when it does vi return of the interesting part so what will happen if the conversion passes well there are a few different scenarios scenario 1 my favorite the price of common stays about where it was trading before the conversion vote i can already feel the angry comments coming because that just feels wrong but ask yourself and i know asking for introspection is a lot here what is stock dilution in a broad bigwordy sense stockholders are the residual claimants on a company when all the liabilities are subtracted out of all the assets in effect they get the leftover value of the company dilution is bad because you are having more people show up at the party to take more scraps from the old shareholders when it happens the share price goes down duh but here something super fucking weird happened a nearidentical security to common ape with an identical economic claim same level of residual claim on the company is trading for less than the common that has the same economic rights this is kinda like if you look at a quarter with the p mint mark for philadelphia and it s going for $025 but a quarter with a d mark from the denver mint is only selling for $013 because the people who made it are weird and smoke the devil s lettuce and climb mountains and wear too much patagonia in this scenario no dilution is occurring when the conversion happens because the apes already diluted the common shares when they were made and no new economic rights are being made in this exchange read my lips no new dilution so when the conversion happens your $150 ape share converts to the $5 common share hopefully if you are not a highfinance person just skip this next paragraph i am sure you high finance nerds are going to complain that simply flipping the cheaper apes into the more expensive commons would cause the overall enterprise value of amc to skyrocket and that this new total enterprise value would exceed the old value because the number of common increases while per share value stays the same which necessarily makes a higher total enterprise value because this boosts the equity value component to this i respond that we just have to wait and see what happens because this scenario is so unique in modern trading history sure it seems like the value of common should drop but then we have to ask ourselves why the value of identical apes dropped in the first place which erased a lot of equity value when the trading discount between the two instruments opened up they should always have been equal when trading in an efficient market it could be that as matt levine wrote in december on this topic scroll down to a later subsection his emails are like 30 inches long on your phone that a lot of value was destroyed when people got this weirdfeeling ape asset deposited into their accounts and that created the discount i m hoping that this value lost when the economic rights were split will materialize back into the equity when they reunify ok normies come back the adults are done talking if this happens and taking the value of common as of close friday 113 of $5 the stock could close after the conversion somewhere around $4450 why not $5 why did i figure in a 1020 haircut humans are emotional creatures and even though there is no financial reason maybe for a price drop people will probably just feel like one should happen so it will this scenario presents an upside of 167233 scenario 2 ignoring everything that i wrote above assume a worstcase valuation scenario that the market takes a weighted average of all the new common shares together and reprices to that which is possible but i think unduly negative to price this we need to first find the total equity value of amc which is comprised of common and ape units and can be found by adding up the product of share count and share price for each security the equity value of common as of 113 is $5 516 000 000 simplified share count which gets us $258b the equity value of ape is $15 900 000 000 simplified and taking the liberty of pretending that antara already bought their shares they promised which gets us $135b adding them together amc s equity value is $393b now we divide that number by the new count of 1 416 000 000 common shares after conversion to get a projected equity value of $256 per share this scenario presents an upside of 70 and is really what i view to be a price floor still looks pretty damn good part 7 taking it all home per amc s bylaws they have to notify shareholders of a special meeting vote no less than 10 days before it and no more than 60 days before it marrying this to amc s promise to have the shareholder vote by march 22 and antara s massive follow on 200m ape share purchase around january 22 we can assume that the window for the magic vote is between february 1 and march 10th again matt levine briefly sketched out this idea in his december 22 newsletter all leg work here is mine but gotta give cred where cred is due since he gave me the idea to check all of this out so i am thinking more and more institutions and retail will hop in the closer we get to this window already apes were $065 when news first broke and here we are at $150 on 113 the sooner one buys the apes the more effective this strategy may be if you want to get fancy you could also short amc to profit from both ends of the trade but i will not discuss that here since if you are approved to short you can figure that out yourself positions 2 250 apes potential to scale up to 3 000 and i am considering shorting common but i haven t decided yet tldr the unicorn of the financial world pure arbitrage is alive and well if you long ape put the certificates under your pillow and hope that the hedge fund fairy turns it into common shares while you sleep we re back baby

how can i find the consumption of products of a company by country mondelez inc x nestle sa i m trying to find out the consumption of products by mondelez inc x nestle sa around the globe here is why lots of brazilians are now boycotting products by mondelez inc since a big left wing influencer has become the face of their product called bis in the past years this influencer has been chasing all brands that sponsored right wings points of view and telling his followers to not buy from those companies things have escalated that even two politics from the left party have posted photos with bis this is not a joke but what a circus right to confront the bisnuncamais bisneveragain hashtag that have organically emerged and been on brazil trending topics of x former twitter for the past three days reaching nearly 250k mentions in one of those days now people started to dive deep and target all products from mondelez inc there s even payless publicity by other influencers and regulars of its direct competition kitkat by nestle even mondelez brazil has shared a note stating that it does not support any political side but all points of views and that the influencer was chosen because of his range on games and entertainment even tho the movement of love bis started too it hasn t reached any substantial numbers yet and still it might be easier to not buy a product or buy from the competition than to keep on buying to hype the sales right specially because statistically in brazil the majority of people with more money support the right wing and the opposite applies as well i m here because in the past week mondelez inc shares dropped a bit and some people are associating this to the bis product how likely is that i m not an expert at all but i doubt it could be because of one product that only sells in brazil right therefore i m trying to find if the potential drop on sales of bis can impact mdlz shares at all and i d like to start by knowing if i can see the percentage of sales of mondelez inc by country anywhere on the web if you know how please share bottom line they turned a candy a matter of right x left wing in brazil and by no doubt the sales gonna have some impact as the engagement of the no bis no mondelez propaganda is already making its way out of the x bubble ps i m sorry to bring up this almost comical skit during the sensitive times we are living in worldwide

recent report gross margin is how much a company earns from revenue before subtracting operating expenses taxes and interest peller said the square business needs to expand faster internationally a move that could improve profitability key details square and marqeta mq on aug 8 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for cash app and afterpay in july block sued visa v and mastercard ma on antitrust grounds alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging us merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees jack dorsey is bald now unrelated to the above points one question is how resistant square will be to a business downturn considering the fears of recession the relatively low income levels of square s customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the us economy weakens but it s fine moving on cash app growth the square cash app helps individuals manage money buy stocks and cryptocurrency and more block aims to bridge the cash app and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from afterpay acquired last year its growth has slowed further fintech companies like afterpay that are buy now pay later or bnpl face increased regulation announced aug 1 2021 the afterpay deal was originally valued at $29 billion with the big drop in block stock the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing in the emerging bnpl market where afterpay competes the players there are encroaching on credit card networks apple aapl has emerged as a rival to afterpay another rival of afterpay is affirm holdings afrm see i m left wondering whether block really needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering competition is heating up in the bnpl market another questionable deal square acquired a majority stake in jayz s tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock lol highfidelity headscratcher or 4d chess you tell me but let s not sleep on the cash app it s throwing punches in the peertopeer payment rumble duking it out with venmo and zelle block brass are talking up a storm about a shiny new investment plan which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles gaap little ray of sunshine here square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet plus square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock which gives insiders more voting power moving on in late 2021 square changed its name to block while sticking to the sq ticker this whole rebranding is their love letter to blockchain and crypto meanwhile bitcoin has rallied during the banking crisis this is mentioned in detail on my coin post but bitcoin is still down significantly from its high near $68 900 in november 2021 block has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoinbased commerce on its merchant platform in addition square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on bitcoin cash app user growth and monetization will certainly be key to the outlook for sq stock cash app growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus the bearish view is that cash app growth will slow as the us economy normalizes the company retains the square brand for merchants that use its pointofsale technology and services jack dorsey is bald for earnings i need to remind myself how paypal reacted big green i m going to go ahead and grab 1103 47c at about 100 each i m hoping to see sq hit well over 48 tonight keep in

us court sides with sec on market data overhaul in blow to big exchanges new york may 24 reuters a us appeals court on tuesday said the securities and exchange commission can proceed with its overhaul of the way essential stock market data is collected and disseminated striking a blow to exchanges that earn revenue from the data and had opposed the plan the sec in 2020 approved new rules governing public data feeds that it said would also improve transparency and address inefficiencies in the collection and dissemination of the data following years of complaints by brokers that the exchanges that control the data are conflicted in their role nasdaq inc ndaqo intercontinental exchange inc s icen nyse unit and cboe global markets cboez opposed the plan which allows firms other than the exchanges to develop and sell data products based on data obtained from the exchanges the exchange groups which together run 12 of the 16 us stock exchanges argued the new rules were contrary to the goals and policies of the securities exchange act in denying the exchanges petition against the sec a threejudge panel on the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia said the sec s rule clearly represents a reasonable balancing of the objectives congress directed the commission the exchanges were put in charge of the data feeds which show current best prices and last trades for stocks before they were forprofit companies and the rules were last updated in 2005 since then exchanges have created faster more sophisticated proprietary data feeds that compete against the public feeds many larger brokers say they need to pay for those private data feeds often more expensive than the public ones in order to remain competitive and that this has created a twotiered market

ultimate nvidia dd the best first things first this deep dive isn t about nvidia s next earnings call or the coming few months we re zooming out here looking at nvidia from a mid to longterm investment lens it seemed to me like common knowledge that nvidia s future valuation is way overvalued yet it turns out many are still in the dark no betting against nvidia doesn t mean you re antiai it means you re skeptical about nvidia s monopolistic hype in the ai space first let s start with the obvious how has the value of nvidia which previously generated half of its revenue from games skyrocketed recently you could say it s because of ai but that can easily be misunderstood it would be much better to say it s because of chatgpt aifocused development started a long long time ago yes ai is the future but your neighbor doesn t believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks how did the general public attitude shift towards a complete aihype because a new product came onto the market with many great breakthroughs but it s not just any product it s a product that is easy to understand easy to use by everybody and for everybody an ai product that businesses and consumers can understand this general public attention has made openai so important it changed from openai to closedai and is now profit oriented look up their background story this general public attention has caused every other company investing in ai to release their unfinished product to market that s how we got bard from google that s how we got these donald trump ai images because companies didn t even bother to invest time in developing better security filters they had to release their product now they gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs they had to be first or at least not late to the party how did meta train llama with nvidia gpus same as microsoftopenai and everybody else why did they choose nvidia i wrote an analogy about this in a comment which i m copying into this dd but first consider these important facts nvidia is a fabless company their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees nearly nobody can replacecompete with tsmc intel is trying to every major company that has invested in nvidia has announced that they are working on their own custom chips this will also improve performance since the chip is designed for their specific ai development nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies it s not a product that they sell to retail customers the analogy private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood the companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees wood tsmc can be described as the trees nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees the tsmc trees are a special kind of trees they are more robust than other trees but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break at the moment everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture they look better and they are robust you could say they are the future of furniture nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the tsmc trees everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying nvidia axes but there are 2 problems nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees but not perfect also nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market what is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process does this mean that nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share no does this mean that nvidia might be overvalued and not the only goto company for these axes could this mean that they won t quadruple their profits every year yes nvidia made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train ais the design nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market but it is not the best design training llms would have been better with customized chips but designing chips takes some time at least 12 years so what did companies like microsoftopenai meta and google do train their llms on nvidia chips someone said to me that nvidia is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that s their moat this tells me that the person doesn t know the process behind chip production we can even look at each company involved here and get a simple clear picture nvidia does not produce chips they only design them which company produces nvidias chips it s tsmc tsmc by the way also produces chips for amd and for apple so there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big chip design company why are they all using this single company that could will be attacked by china one day and disrupt their entire supply chain because that is the really difficult moat part with ai chips this company is the only one truly relevant for ai growth anyone can design chips but only one company can make them there are of course small exceptions some companies design and produce their own chips and we have to look at them not to invest in them but to better understand why nvidia doesn t have future moat so which famous company produces their own chips intel do you know why intel lost so much market share to amd this is the reason because they produce their own chips not because of the design building a chip factory is a highly complex highly expensive matter and takes years intel was slower than the competition they were stuck with the old nm production processes and couldn t get their new systems up and running fast enough amd was winning market share because tsmc produces their chips intel now changed their strategy they now let their competitor tsmc produce their chips so they can stay in the market in the meantime they re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again according to estimates intel will pay tsmc 14 billion us dollars over the next two years for 3nanometer chips now you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that nvidia will be the future for all ai chip designs despite every major ai company literally saying they will design their own chips ok here is an example where a famous company used primarily nvidia chips but stopped doing so however in 2010 apple made a significant decision that would alter its gpu trajectory the company began developing its own graphics technology resulting in the creation of the metal framework metal allowed developers to access the full power of apple s gpus optimizing performance and efficiency this move signaled a shift away from nvidia s gpus as apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration since then apple has predominantly relied on its inhouse gpu solutions including those integrated into its aseries chips found in iphones and ipads these customdesigned gpus have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency further solidifying apple s commitment to developing its own graphics technology does apple use nvidia ts2compl because you are all regarded here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips microsoft microsoft is finally making custom chips and they re all about ai the verge meta exclusive meta to deploy inhouse custom chips this year to power ai drive memo reuters google google training gemini on its own chips reveals another of its advantages forbescom chatgpt exclusive chatgptowner openai is exploring making its own ai chips reuters in the meantime meta and microsoft say they will buy amds new ai chip as an alternative to nvidia meta and microsoft to buy amd s new ai chip as alternative to nvidia cnbccom since i feel so validated by the links above i ll stop writing my dd which would have additionally dealt with nvidia s past as a company acquisitions and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market raytracing physix

how have you hedged your risk in this year s declining market environment i m talking about the method i m doing which is currently successful the market has been falling since november 2021 bezos and musk sold shares at the same time late last year fortunately i realized that the market could go down so i also sold most of my stocks decisively so i didn t lose anything this year but i know that a lot of people lost more than 30 today in a falling market environment i also try to do some shortterm trades i also do wti hedging i have also tried many ways but it doesn t work well later testing stock hedging in a demo account led me to a great method and in subsequent trades traded over four weeks using my live account so far the deal looks pretty good simply put a hedging order is set every day the socalled hedging order is to set long and short positions on the same stock at the same time and set stop loss but not set profit then but if the stock goes up or down the next day the reverse order will be stopped and another order will be profitable at this point you only need to manually close the profitable order x200b below i ll post some of my transaction details my trading results for the first week on may 16th i placed a tsla hedge order at 719 the next day tsla opened i closed my position at 744 and finally made a profit of 6k on may 17th i placed a tsla hedge order on 754 when the market opened the next day i closed my position at 746 and ended up with a profit of $1 500 i lost 4k on the remaining two trades this week and ended up making $3500 x200b my second week trading results on may 23 i placed an amzn hedge order at 2137 when the market opened the next day i closed the position at the price of 2083 and finally made 5k on may 26th i placed an amzn hedge order at 2228 when the market opened the next day i closed the position at 2262 and finally made 4k i lost 4k on the remaining two trades this week and ended up with a 5k profit x200b my third week trading results on may 31st i placed an amzn hedge order at 2428 when the market opened the next day i closed the position at the price of 2441 and finally made a profit of 8k on june 2 i set up an amzn hedge order at 2498 when the market opened the next day i closed my position at 2482 and finally made a profit of 3k the remaining two trades for the week lost 5k and ended up with a profit of 6k currently this week i m trying google s hedge order and it seems to be working fine the difference in profit is also related to the amount of trades i use x200b this is my actual trading situation for the first three weeks do you have the same hedging strategy as i do or what method do you use to do hedging transactions of course there may be better ways to hedge in fact in a falling market environment your stock cannot make money so essentially you are already losing money if your stock loses a lot it means your losses are even worse therefore we hope that everyone can achieve better returns hope you guys can share your views or you know a better way to do it x200b warning this is not considered financial advice just for discussion

puts on grbk green brick partners nyse is a public company that builds homes and develops land ans is one of the fastest growing in the country although recently housing prices continue to drop rapidly and this stock is severely overvalued way above their pe when i say way overvalued i mean by around 10x overvalued with a marketcap of 15b and a price of around $32 per share it has grown 70 this past year growth is directly related to the price of the stock and the valuation of the company but the reason this moment is so important is because i believe this is where the growth stops and the stock tanks not financial advice but i am currently in puts
there is only one smart way to do it and i don t mean by bailout at least not directly what treasury should do is to convert some of existing lowyield treasuries to a higheryield treasuries for each willing institution for a fee the goal is to raise premiums from institutions only in the amount needed to allow all svb deposits to be withdrawn so number of treasuries to be converted and increase in yield would be targeted towards that goal but keeping both of those values as small as possible thanks to such process no deposits will be lost svb which obviously sucks in money management remains closed for ever cash to cover deposits comes from other financial institutions not treasury directly treasury spend is kept at necessary minimum with actual cash spend pushed into future thank you good night
a boring post about gex but you had no weekend plans anyway so i ve talked here and again here about gex this is somewhat advanced material to be throwing across the wendy s trading desk but some of you understand delta and can properly execute a spread so learning about gex is important because the more you know about the market the better your excuses for how your trade went against you i know some guys and they did a podcast on gex about a tool to look at it the first part is about the tool blah blah blah okay crap this is a problem i have involvement with the tool so i want this to be tool agnostic and highlight the knowledge of gex but the first part actually has a great intro to what you need to know about gex and options and how it s calculated before talking about the tool so it s a good watch but whatever about the tool anyway but in the second part there are some great examples of how looking at gex can help you read direction in the market the website for the tool has a free chart updated every 2 minutes and unless you really get into this stuff that s all you need before you get started i need to explain some things that might confuse you first there will be no crayons you have to bring your own snacks second most of this talk will be about spx not spy spx is the raw market calculation and spy is that divided by 10 more or less i trade futures so i am used to seeing 4162 instead of 4162 but past spy options trading me might be confused spx options are often used for dealer hedging and has strikes ever 5 points 50 cents of spy looking at these nodes and thinking about price jumps and drops really should light a lightbulb if you ve watched the market for a while third understanding gex is not a magic bullet to get you a boat a sports car and a new waifu pillow as i have said in the first two posts gamma is a tool among many that helps you understand what the market is doing there are a lot of other gex workers on this street corner but your understanding of this concept is important as you continue to pump your minimum wage pennies under the steam roller learn to feel the waves in the market oh and since that first post dix has lost more and more interest as correlation and causation don t seem to be there that s part of the evolution of the market we find something we hope it works we notice it doesn t we move on gex will always be here because gex is baked into the blackscholes model until someone else wins the nobel for a new way to price options that will still be relevant

welcome to my journal club drug dd schizophrenia phase 3 data tldr this is not the traditional dd you are used to reading this is an indepth look at medical research that supports a future event for the dd i did a journal club on the material presented below this is a new type of treatment here s a future play for you all karuna therapeutics is very likely to get fda approval from its phase 3 trial for karxt at this point it s above my buyin ability so i ll let this one go and take what i got disclaimer i m not employed by karuna therapeutics my research is my play my career path is in medicine you decide if you want to lose money by following me i consider this unethical because i did a journal club on this journal clubs in the medical field are discussions about medical treatments on any published paper and test the person presenting the paper if they understand what s going on in the article it requires the presenter to be very knowledgeable about the topic including the interventions questions asked can be very difficult presentations are done in front of a room full of medical professionals medical professionals don t hold back on the questions you can get your ass handed to you if you can t answer their questions especially if it s one doctor who s a top expert on a specific topicdisease state it s the hot water situation journal clubs are highlevel discussion far above wallstreetbets pay grade for the uninitiated with zero medical background this type up i am doing because is going to have medical terms i ll try my best to explain at the level of the general public x200b this whole thing started with this published paper on which i had to do a journal club schizophrenia this is a disease that is characterized by positive hallucinations delusions and negative symptoms lack of interest motivation desire inability to feel pleasure in other words positive symptoms are symptoms that shouldn t be present in a normal person and negative symptoms are the emotions and cognitive functions not present in a normal functioning human being without schizophrenia these symptoms are the result of what is called the dopamine hypothesis where an imbalance of that neurotransmitter gives rise to symptoms of schizophrenia from what i learned about this disease state mechanistically it s a result of too much dopamine released on neurotransmitters so treating means dialing back the release but i m oversimplifying currently schizophrenia is treated using guidlines such as the 2020 american psychiatric association practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that s a direct link to the pdf file for that guideline it discusses the assessment and treatment of schizophrenia current treatments in schizophrenia are divided between 1st generation typical antipsychotics and 2nd generation atypical antipsychotics medication classes of antipsychotics based on the mechanism of action the mechanism of action of these drugs is important because it drives medical recommendations 1st generation antipsychotics haldol chlorpromazinethorazine loxapine mellaril prolixin work on the dopamine pathways present in the brain to decrease dopamine neurotransmitters release antagonizes d2 receptors but cause unwanted side effects called extrapyramidal symptoms akathisia dystonia dyskinesia akinesia parkinsonian and tardive dyskinesia side effects are the reason these medications aren t tried first on patients presenting with symptoms of schizophrenia in the usual cases 2nd generation medications abilify rexulti vraylar zyprexa invega and seroquel are considered firstline agents because there is enough clinical data to support the recommendation of these agents because it has fewer side effects and is more favorable compared to typical antipsychotics another problem with antipsychotic medications is some cause more weight gain than others x200b i ve given some background about the disease state now to go into the paper itself for some patients one antipsychotic isn t enough to control the symptoms of schizophrenia some patients may go through two trials of antipsychotics if that doesn t work patients get put on clozapine which is indicated for treatmentresistant schizophrenia but clozapine has many side effects and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems program because of these side effects due to the current treatments for schizophrenia researchers have been looking for alternative pathways in the brain to treat the condition x200b the published paper in the nejm muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist and peripheral antagonist for schizophrenia this is a phase 2 study about the use of a combination of cholinergicanticholinergic medication karxt to treat schizophrenia the best part of this medication is zero activity affecting the dopamine d2 pathway the two active ingredients are xanomeline and trospium xanomeline is a centrally acting cholinergic agent that can penetrate the bloodbrain barrier but has plenty of cholinergic side effects with zero dopamine pathway activation selective for the m1m4 receptors this agent has been trialed in alzheimer s m1 agonism may improve cognitive deficits and m4 agonism may reduce psychotic symptoms xanomeline s mechanism of action decreases dopamine in the ventral tegmental area which would decrease symptoms of schizophrenia it also increases dopamine in the prefrontal cortex to improve cognition and negative and affective symptoms trospium is an m2m3 peripheral antagonist fda approved for overactive bladder with symptoms of urge incontinence due to the compound s tertiary amine group it cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier polarized compounds generally can t pass through the bloodbrain barrier they must be neutral in charge and lipophilic in nature the combination of both agents trospium is added to xanomeline to mitigate the cholinergic side effects of centrally acting muscarinic agents the study took xanomelinetrospium karxt and compared it against a placebo in patients with schizophrenia over a 5week trial the importance of that study is a statistically significant reduction of symptoms of schizophrenia in the positive and negative syndrome scale scores panss gold standard for antipsychotic clinical trials between placebo and experimental agent over a 5week period the majority of side effects experienced in the experimental group karxt were constipation nausea vomiting dry mouth dyspepsia and vomiting only symptoms of nausea vomiting dry mouth dyspepsia and vomiting decreased over time during the trial constipation remained in the experimental group over time the downside to this trial is some patients do not tolerate the effect of karxt hence the reason they drop out there are medications that can be given to patients for constipation if the karxt medication were to be dispensed as part of treatment for schizophrenia x200b x200b the realized trade i did because i knew the data from their phase 2 trial was so good it was going to pass the expectation of its phase 3 trial what you see here is the realized play of karuna therapeutics a few days before they announced their phase 3 emergent2 results i set a 9 trailing stop loss using past experience to know if the stock was going down further that triggered i was waiting for this company to release its data x200b x200b x200b today 882022 karuna therapeutics released the results of their emergent2 trial for schizophrenia and it went about as expected from what i expected when i read their published phase 2 trial article trial met primary endpoint with karxt demonstrating a statistically significant 96point reduction in panss total score compared to placebo at week 5 p00001 trial also met key secondary endpoints demonstrating statistically significant reductions in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by the panss positive panss negative and panss negative marder factor subscales karxt was generally well tolerated with a side effect profile substantially consistent with prior trials of karxt in schizophrenia the company plans to submit a new drug application nda with the us food drug administration fda in mid2023 x200b they have their phase 3 data which is the final step that will be used as part of getting fda approval
how many stocks do you own warren buffett once advised a bunch of youngsters to get a punch card with only 20 spots in it that s the number of stocks they re allowed to buy in their lifetime he told them imagine how careful they would be if they could only buy 20 companies in their entire life of 80 or 100 years compare that to what many retail investors do nowadays they treat their investments like a playstation game they think that they need to always act if they don t act they lose the game they assume the fact of the matter is investing isn t a game it isn t easy if it was most people would win in reality though the majority of investors actually lose some estimate that 90 of investors lose the problem is most investors believe they are among the 10 that win

us producer prices jumped 112 in march from a year earlier the biggest increase on record us producer prices rose at their fastest pace in march since records began in 2010 underscoring persistent inflationary pressures at the production level and the risk that they could feed into consumer prices the ppi of final demand rose 112 in march from a year earlier and 14 monthonmonth labor department data showed wednesday the monthonmonth increase was also the largest on record and ppi rose across all categories the median forecast of economists surveyed by bloomberg had been for a 106 per cent yearonyear rise and a 11 per cent monthonmonth rise the data show that in the first full month after the conflict between russia and ukraine price pressures in production increased as the conflict led to widespread increases in energy food and metals prices in addition manufacturers and other producers seeking to strike a balance between supply and steady demand face a more difficult situation because of transportation bottlenecks and labor shortages the risk is that at least some of the higher input costs for producers will be passed on to consumers as companies try to protect profit margins tuesday s report showed consumer prices rose in march by the most since late 1981 driven by higher prices for food housing and gasoline the ppi and cpi reports add to pressure on the federal reserve to aggressively raise interest ratesfed officials have opened the door to a 05 percentage point increase in may

cvna recent debt exchange discussion of details sec filing company currently has $5725 billion of existing unsecured notes these are being exchanged in some fashion for new senior secured notes worth $4376 billion but the terms aren t clear to me because i m not familiar with bond exchanges when the sec filing says certain eligible holders of existing unsecured notes collectively representing over 90 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the existing unsecured notesagreed to the terms of the transactions listed belowthe exchange of the existing unsecured notes for up to $4376 billion of the following three tranches of senior secured notes does this mean cvna will still have 10 of that original amount going forward because the agreement references 90 of the note holders not 100 ie $570 million old debt plus $4376 billion of new debt per this agreement or will the nonrepresented 10 be forced to accept these terms and they will only have $4376 billion total going forward the former makes the most sense to me as i can t imagine unsecured vs secured debt warrants that much of a haircut but maybe i am wrong can anyone clarify

soft landings here s my take on the soft landing the runway has only just come into sight our pilot is about to attempt his first ever landing in fact it s his first time flying a plane and he s never seen this airport but it s known to have an exceptionally short runway where there have been several rather spectacular crashes in the past there are some storm clouds gathering on the horizon he comes onto the loudspeaker and announces that he s feeling great about the coming landing after all it s looking sunny outside the passengers erupt into applause and start celebrating their safe arrival meanwhile a handful of passengers remain quiet wondering if they are crazy to be wondering if there s a chance that things might not go to plan sound absolutely ridiculous powell is about to walk a tight rope think for yourself don t be complacent and be careful having a portfolio that is highly dependent on a single hardsoftno landing scenario good luck to you all
qqqanalysis if you split the bear market decline in 4 equal parts highlighted in yellow bar you notice a significant reaction at the bottom of each of the bars the mar 2022 rally failed at the bottom of the first bar aug rally at the bottom of the second bar nov rally at the bottom of the third bar the oct low at the bottom of the fourth bar after forming a low in oct $qqq moved above the nov high this has been a change from what happened before it didn t establish a lower low a full measured move of the oct low to nov high would project a price target to the aug high so $330 $qqq closed around the half way point of the third bar red line if it closes above that level so $313 odds would favor the completion of the measured move to $330 the nov high the bottom of the third bar around $29250 is a must hold support level x200b

do not overidolize anyone some of the bagholders will not like reading this but elon hype is dead it s over i am sorry but this is it you know how stockmarket works once a hype is gone it s gone nobody will ever believe him again even if he goes to mars now or sends 100 tesla to the orbit doesn t matter he will be remembered as doge scammer pump dumper liar etc his ego has taken over his identity and morality look majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life they lose their minds they become arrogant powerhungry lose humility their very identity and morality they start to play minigod and surround themselves with yesman and if their minigod status ever gets challenged they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story just look around you i am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way i am not exaggerating 99 of the time you will see same story happening the guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore he has more money so in his mind he is more successful so that makes him right on everything he no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions i admired elon musk when he had mars landing presentations etc people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity s progression i admired bill gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives i was a binance user for a long time and i admired cz cz is no longer same person as first time binance was launched he has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator bottom line is that do not overidolize anyone not warren buffet not vitalik etc anyone i mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today very very few people don t lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground but at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses that is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again if by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism s game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing having some self principles and self virtues will keep your ego in check and keep your feet on the ground

$mrvi dd i have 0 idea what this company does but after seeing the most suspicious insider trading post i have ever seen i decided to take a look thinks that mrvi is going to get acquired but doesn t know how options work or how to capitalize on it never traded options before somehow has a lot of conviction x200b put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 this is more important since it measures the number of contracts actually opened numbers from put call ratio is lopsided x200b average volume is around 2m but yesterday there was 6m volume and it went up a decent amount for no reason avg volume vs yesterday mrvi has been getting acquisition offers recently offer was at 42$ per share and was rejected when it was trading at 28$ per share recently there was another offer to buy them out earnings is next week and if there are any potential acquisitions i believe it might be announced around then with the ridiculously high amount of calls vs puts ending on aug 15 along with the unusual activity they are decently cheap if mrvi gets bought out at 42$ it would be trading at a 30$ premium compared to currently each option if bought atm could be 30x100 in profit positions 2x mrvi aug 19 125c 95date is different because i m in different timezone tldr mrvi put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 cheap play that could pay off with a lot of money possible acquisition announced soon edit some more interesting links i ve found biotechne tech exploring takeover of maravai lifesciences mrvi source

my full plan for this week 1031 challenge update 7 earnings plays 1 major economic event fomc 5 stocks 1 lotto 10x play hello ladies and gentlemen i m ash and write detailed dd on stocks and events so last week i published my full plan and analysisin this post we will cover $2k to $100k challenge update this week s earnings this week s major economic events this week s watchlist this week s lotto 10 bagger play ok so let s get this show on the road $2k to $100k challenge update for those of you who dont know im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday starting with $2k actually $18k and trade my way to $100k live in front of everyone everyday options starting amount $1000 day 17 closing amount $5038 port change 400 proof futurescommodities starting amount $800 day 17 closing amount $1500 port change 875 i found that people for the most are not really interested in globalfutures plays but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week let me know in the comments this week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves the drop on the gdp release we ran on very bad news for feds the drop was inevitable and another big gainer was pce release got in pm into spx calls when i saw bullish divergence between price action and rsi and added size after pce meet expectation as it was good news for the feds and pce is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes the following is basically my plan for next week major economic events monday 1031 945 am chicago pmi 1000 am dallas fed manufacturing index oct tuesday 1101 945 am sp global pmi final oct 1000 am ism manufacturing pmi oct 1000 am jolts job openings sep wednesday 1102 815 am adp employment change oct 200 pm fed interest rate decision 230 pm fed press conference thursday 1103 830 am balance of trade sep 1000 am ism nonmanufacturing pmi oct friday 1104 830 am non farm payroll oct 830 am unemployment rate oct so all these are very important events that will move the market but the offcourse the important event is the fed conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing so my play here is in 2 parts part 1 the rate hike believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much let me explain as of friday 28oct the market is pricing 0 chance of 100bps 813 chance of 75bps 187 chance of 50bps now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds the fed doesnt like to freak the market they also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50bps in addition to that why do 50bps when they can get away with 75bps without freaking out the market in all cases they definitely not doing 100bps if they do 75bps as expected we run a little ill tell why a little later on if they 50bps we run alot it seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike and sell on the spike for that delicious iv spiked premium part 2 the meeting well this is where it gets very tricky so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the fed to pivot or at least start talking about pivoting this time if they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200ma on the spx 1d chart if they we cant do that yet we are getting new 52 week lows this part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not for funsies ill give you my expectations but honeslty im going to play it by ear im 5050 on what they plan to do and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$ you can also do a straddle anyway looking at the pce report inflation is not so bad thats why ran hard after the report was out its not the best report in the world but its an improvement for sure add to that the st louis fed came out with report stating the fed is wrong to look only at cpi as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now the fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to this is a much worse scenario than inflation thats why the fed is being careful on the other hand gdp came out pretty damn positive the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen while some growth tech companies missed most of them just lowered guidance they didnt actually miss most of the not so sexy companies beat this is good for the stock market very bad for the feds this means that demand is not getting crushed and if demand is high prices will likely remain elevated so all this might signal to the fed that job not done yet we need more pain as you can see there are very good reasons for the fed to go either way i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about the us treasuries the most liquid market in the world is losing its liquidity with uk and japan selling us treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes 2008 2001 great depression will not even come close to the global collapse that we might experience central banks chairs around the world have been pestering powell about that recently i think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen but like i said we shall see

silvergate capital play let me start by saying i don t have a single dollar in this stock and i ll follow that by saying this is half ass dd so anyways i m hanging around the cryptosphere and i keep hearing about this bank silvergate bank this silvergate bank that had no idea who they were before and i know that scene pretty well turns out they re the go to for onramping crypto buys for corporations and large buyers trying to operate legally for example when tesla bought those billions in bitcoin they didn t buy it from a miner they went through an intermediary bank here we get to the meat and potatoes they re in the news because evidently they had exposure to ftx crypto exchange and obviously the bear market has hammered them they ve processed $1 trillion since 2017 and were the trusted go to for on ramping buttt major players are now coming out saying hey don t worry we don t have silvergate exposure the stock has dropped almost 60 today and the shorts are at 72 of float they re filing their 10k late but if they somehow make it out of this alive this thing could go parab0lic and serve some justice
where will the stock market go after tomorrow s fed meeting 0230321 stock market diary x200b us stocks in fact yesterday there was news that jpm they may have to convert the 30 billion saved to frc into stocks or bonds today s news is that frc is going to slim down and save itself the market seems to further think that frc should have dodged a bullet frc surged 40 the tight situation of the banking system seems to be eased so the stock market strengthened further before the fed meeting today the three major indices rose again by about 1 while the market is still expecting a 25 bps rate hike tomorrow current fedwatch probability is over 80 the market is also expecting a possible dovish tone from the fed at the same time x200b i think the current financial market region is stable the fed also emergency bailout of svb depositors as well as to facilitate the merger of credit suisse ubs and in order to alleviate market concerns but also joint other five major central banks to provide liquidity to enterprises in need of us dollars do so much the us stock index also rose above the price of svb before the bankruptcy the financial market is basically stable the fed should be in line with the 80 of market participants expected to go 25 basis points while they may slow down the pace of tapering and the financial markets to make a commitment to market stability last year when the british pension crisis the united kingdom had temporary qe the fed may follow the practice x200b if the united states really raise interest rates by 25 basis points indeed shortterm to maintain the credit of the fed but to the already overburdened financial markets and press a heavy burden perhaps before their meeting in may the financial markets will have thunder to burst and us stocks on the fed s easing expectations have been speculating for 23 weeks from another point of view the fed s round of table expansion is also real the market the liquidity is more and it makes sense for the stock market to rise from the technical graphics qqq broke through the upper edge of the downward trend channel near 308 today closing on the strong resistance level of 310 which is a strong signal but the volume of the stock market in the past two days are very small whether it is an effective breakthrough is still difficult to say or wait for the fed meeting and then judge the direction of the market for a period of time after it us dollar x200b us stocks are strong but the dollar index is still down slightly on the one hand no matter how the fed s rate hike cycle to the end even if the 25 basis point rate hike this time does not mean that the fed can maintain interest rates at high levels for a long time on the other hand the market believes that the risk of the financial system is decreasing so must sentiment is receding which is the main reason for the decline in safehaven assets today x200b that s all for today s analysis your attention is the biggest motivation for my daily progress if you have any questions or questions about the stock market please add a friend to my private message to ask i am amy thank you for your support

inflation won t get to 2 in many years because the fdic will continue to bailout banks to prevent bank failures the federal reserve s dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices and one tool they use to achieve these goals is the manipulation of interest rates if there is a recession the fed will move quickly to lower interest rates as this can stimulate borrowing and investment which can in turn boost employment and overall economic growth lowered interest rates also increase the supply of money in the economy which can help stabilize prices however the fed must balance these concerns with the need to prevent inflation which can also negatively impact the economy ultimately the decisions made by the fed regarding interest rates have farreaching impacts on the economy as a whole and are carefully considered and closely monitored
volume tickers in play trading thesis tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment s price i look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day with a marketcap of no less than 500 million the shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used or shares traded that information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected uptrending tickers ebs 51923 10c 100 downtrending tickers carg 51923 17p 100 wmt 51923 145p 133 knx 51923 55p 120 tsco 51923 230p 165 ccep 51923 195p 65 dhi 51923 100p 90 cprt 51923 75p 75 ul 51923 55p 140 nvs 51923 975p 60 irdm 51923 65p 85 mlco 51923 14p 75 bx 51923 85p 163 things to consider when finding the plays if the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket i will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day if the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before i will consider it for a long play if trading less than the movement of the ticker i would consider a short or put play if all the other factors previously mentioned checks out the trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed
twitter elon musk am i simping or is it just reality elon musk the ceo of $tsla and spacex just bought few billion $ worth of stock in $twtr elon officially hold the majority stake 92 of the social media giant twitter elon history in entering companies as cofounder or founder was a pure success paypal and tesla is a great example of how elon positively change companies to the better elon is not wall street investor he doesn t buy stocks just for profitinstead elon the modern time thomas edison buy into companies to make them significantly better future of twitter with elon twitter as a company will not be the same as before elon already discussing positive changes in the platform like better free speech and the stupid edit button that twitter talked about adding it before 1 year one year 360 days for edit button oh the productivity anyway elon is a business wizard he will make $twtr the $tsla of social media he will use his successful experience in tesla and paypal to advance the company the conclusion elon is not investor the 92 stake is predictive of his great interest in twitter elon will change twitter to the better just like how he changed tesla and paypal twitter will reach all time highs in stock price in the near and middle term future

what recession why the recession seems to not be happening in most places basically it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow despite the fact that there are high interest rates slowing retail spending layoffs high debt low cash reserves the sky appears to not be falling it will however happen in some places right now there are industries cities and technologies that are going to suffer but there are also ones that will do well there are cities for example that are ripe for a housing crash san francisco phoenix nashville there are industries and companies who if they don t keep up with ai won t make it the companies who have been driving ai msft nvda aapl amzn adbe etc have all done well so far in 2023 the movement and velocity of money while slowing down in the macro sense still hasn t broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats all of it has the same common thread some areas will suffer and some areas will boom we find these by evaluating leadership policy and catalysts for growth things can come to a grinding halt if the consumer is in such a tight spot that money stops flowing however that is also not really happening yet and it would seem as if the federal reserve doesn t truly want to get to that point political climates could change and influence this but that probably won t happen until the next presidential election technically if year over year gdp growth starts to go negative then we are in a recession even still there will be opportunities that arise out of that like a cooled down real estate market and maybe some stocks at discounted valuations right now there are definitely stocks that have been ignored compared to the ai rally and may be ripe for buying typically my basic initial checklist looks like this is this company profitable is it run well does the leadership have a vision and good followthrough does it have a strong cash position does it have a competitive moat am i buying a great company at a fair price what are the catalysts for future growth there are many more factors to take into account but this is a good place to start you can modify and apply these principles to real estate as well

don t be a regard and buy stocks from eavesdroping on wife s business calls tyler loudon a 42yearold houston man learned this lesson the hard way he pleaded guilty thursday to securities fraud for buying and selling stocks based on details gleaned from his wife s business conversations while both were working from home he made $17 million in profits from the deal but has agreed to forfeit those gains if you re gonna do it at least post the gain porn for us to see before you go to prison edit i looked more into how he was caught and found this according to the sec loudon stunned his wife by admitting he bought the shares to make enough money so she could work shorter hours she then notified bp and she was put on leave and then fired even though she had no knowledge he was going to do it she then filed for divorce although i think she would wonder when they do their taxes why they owe $500k in taxes here s the full sec complaint seems finra would have found out found on the finra website finra s code of conduct has a restriction that applies to all accounts that require disclosure to them including those owned by a spouse or domestic partner
what s happening in the market reposting in this sub added trades at the bottom as well there is a likely recession occurring that could be mitigated with a soft landing if there is a recession it will occur in two parts first phase the fed indicates rate hikes increased rates results in the market demanding a higher return on equities to compensate for the additional risk which results in a contraction in the overall market pe ratio but while this is happening the underlying performance earnings of equities generally remains strong unemployment remains low consumers continue to spend as they have jobs and money in their pocket and companies can pass along inflationary impacts to the customer through higher prices i think we are at the end of this first phase second phase prices continue to increase to a point where demand begins to slow as demand slows companies have a harder time passing along increased costs to their customers companies tighten the belt resulting in layoffs which increases unemployment obv and reduces overall demand at this time the underlying performance of equities is impacted and the market falls into a death spiral less demand less earnings layoffs less demand etc this death spiral is only stopped by the fed stepping in usually through an injection of cash and lowered interest rates to spur demand the bottom of the market is right before this happens i think we are at the end of the first phase the second phase won t start until consumers stop spending i see a few factors that could contribute to this starting in q3q4 this year consumers dip into savings this summer to enjoy the warm weather they will come out of the summer with less savings available inflation on mandatory goods remains strong and outpaces salary increases after accounting for mandatory goods house hold budgets have very little money remaining and the summer spending blitz extinguishes their savings the result is less discretionary spending freeze on student debt ends in september further tightening household budgets increased mortgage rates further tighten household budgets for any new home buyer this will have a slower impact on demand but still contributes so what would have to happen for this not to occur it all depends on if supply can recover and meet the demand of the market and how quickly this occurs if this happens quick enough the inflation on mandatory goods will stabilize consumer discretionary spending flatlines or contracts slowly companies manage costs without large layoffs the market slowsstalls for a bit but then continues with moderate growth as supplydemand are back in line with each other this is what the soft landing would look like my best guess is that this soft landing won t be achieved due to the ukraine conflict and covid lockdown in china supply is disrupted long enough for us to begin the death spiral supply will only recover to meet demand once demand is decimated and around this time we will see the bottom and the fed intervene market prediction market rallies on the back of strong earnings until 3q of this year at this time people will start to talk about fomo since they missed the bottom at the same time consumer demand begins to contract and the death spiral begins this will result in a strong recession in 2023 and we will see the bottom only when the fed steps in 34q trades shorting common on mat ulta buying sqqq disclaimer i m likely wrong as no one knows what s going to happen

remarks of richard b smith commissioner united states securities and exchange commission before the american bankers association february 8 1971 when the nasdaq began trading on february 8 1971 as the world s first electronic stock market a piece of paper revisited what i want to discuss with you today is a piece of paper it is nothing more than that and yet it represents a great deal more it is a piece of paper that vitally affects you and us and the entire financial community it is also a piece of paper that despite being old and encrusted with a century or more of hoary legalisms has the most amazing the most appalling reproductive capacity it procreates not merely subdivisions of itself but during the course of its life and travels generates an incredible number of relative pieces of paper that cling to it describe it give it directions authenticate it transfer it transform it cancel it encumber it like all relatives these attachments are each very different and together very expensive the progenitor piece of paper to which i am referring of course is the stock certificate a lengthy read that i m too lazy to type it all out link why did i come across this some might ask well i was trying to find out when stock market became electronic then i was wondering who programmed it okay then why am i curious about who programmed it i m kindly regarded hugely but i still wonder things sometimes if some of you are like me and have been glued to these charts past 2 ish years there s a kind of relative thing happening i can t quite describe it but as a uh prolonged barrelrolling sewing machine pattern if that makes sense and it s not making something it s well sort of seeding a landscape we re looking at from topdown which got me to the wondering part who was it that programmed the nasdaq initially 6oo6ling that specific q got me nothing so i broke down what i could possibly render a reasonable direction from computersoftware companies in the 60 s a few things stood out to me ibm fortran and harlan mills ibm because they were a powerhouse of computing hardware dominance back then in the five years since the passing of watson sr ibm was two and a half times bigger its stock had quintupled and of the 6000 computers in operation in the united states more than 4000 were ibm machines x200b fortran because it is a procedural imperative general purpose computer programming language that works well for scientific computations and numeric operations after ibm developed it in the 1950s it soon gained popularity in programming x200b and then harlan mills just look at his timelines and titles specifically editor for ieee transactions on software engineering 197581 x200b here s my thinking sec knew then what we know now banks are assholes doing asshole stuff if you read more of a piece of paper revisted see way above and they figured well if we get rid of the human element to some degree this might make things more legit for more ppl than less of them ibm is a huge american computer company invest in america it was the 50 s60 s afterall we were boomin baby and they have this fortran language that handles all kinds of processes then we have harlan mills i mean for all what was going on above he has a suspiciously obvious time gap then has sudden relevance at around times where one would have proven their worth pretty sus cuh x200b all right you ve gotten this far in my rabbit hole along my tinfoil travels i came across this other dude edsger w dijkstra he apparently influenced harlan mills as an ibm research fellow mills adapted existing ideas from engineering and computer science to software development these included automata theory the structured programming theory of edsger dijkstra robert w floyd and others and markov chaindriven software testing but what got me in dijkstra s legacy section was the banker s alorithm the banker algorithm sometimes referred to as the detection algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by edsger dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources and then makes an sstate check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue and this is when i came full circle on the part above i was trying to describe at i m kindly regarded anyway this rabbithole kinda tripped me out figured a share regards

ai deez nuts preamble note this is a play concerning c3ai ticker ai recent nvda earnings report is used as supporting evidence i am not suggesting any nvda positions only ai positions prelude so it s no secret that all the nvda bears got ass blasted by their betterthanfeared earnings report even i must concede that it was a pretty good report especially given that their gaming revenues came in at $183b compared to analyst expectations of $159b even in this ass gaming market they even raised guidance 5 due to further anticipated recovery in the gaming market however data center actually missed revenue estimates coming in at $362b vs $385b for the unaware smooth brains data centers are where the gpus that process ai training workloads are stored and maintained this should not have been too surprising as most big tech companies that reported already told you they were cutting back on clouddata center spend stay with me as this brings me to my next point there has been an ai hype trade recently obviously and i am call bullshit now there is nothing in that nvda report to suggest that spending on ai infrastructure is manifestly increasing in the near term at all the conference call was filled with straight up hopium the reality is that most tech companies are scaling back their spend on new data center infrastructure due to tougher macro conditions most earnings calls have made that clear ignore the hype follow the money enterprise spend is slowing therefore the recent ai hype rally irrational exuberance remember when you buy a stock you are paying for future earnings not jensen huang s hopium laced bathwater all of a sudden a bunch of normies are excited that chatgpt can give them a pizza recipe and they think ai is the future of everything ai was not invented in 2023 these companies have been making these investments for decades and this hype cycle is not materially changing anything as far as i can tell sure goog feels some more pressure to not shit the bed on execution but most ai related companies like nvda are just following their long term plans and acting more conservatively if anything due to tighter monetary conditions and macro headwinds oh did you forget that money is literally not free anymore this brings me to my final point and play the 6m treasury bill is yielding 5 literally a year ago that shit was basically zero therefore the riskreward on owning stocks that burn money with no earnings grows more regarded by the day furthermore the economy is holding up better than expected and recently inflation has proved to be stickier than expected so you bet your left ass cheek that rates are going higher enter c3ai ticker symbol ai this is some shit tier company with literally no moat they make enterprise ai for high value use cases and their website looks like some coked up incel vc s wet dream it ipo d in 2020 during peak market insanity for billions of dollars and is still worth billions of dollars did you know that it is possible for a company to not be worth billions of dollars that shit may have flown in a zero rate free money environment it is not gonna fly now but would you look at that it is up over 100 ytd because of the aforementioned ai hype trade this is where rational market participants can take advantage of irrational exuberance using defined risk strategies regarded options plays the play look at the 421 options chain the 20 strike poot is trading around 25 likely lower tomorrow due to the nvda sympathy pump this breaks even at 175 and gives you 58 dte ai was trading around 10 literally last month therefore i believe the options market is inadequately pricing in the risk of a severe correction crash in this ticker this is not gonna be a 10 bagger due to high iv but a 1 bagger at 15 is easily doable and a 34 bagger is possible if it makes a new 52w low i like the riskreward and i don t like this low quality ai rally bear case fundamentals large scale ai adoption actually makes it harder for smaller companies to compete not easier the performance of ai models depends mainly on the quality and amount of the training data big tech has a run away advantage here everyone is using roughly the same algorithms even your whore grandmother is running stochastic gradient descent on her lenovo thinkpad these days in the words of our lord and savior jensen huang large language models are called large because they are quite large this is the reason deepmind goog came up with the best solution to the protein folding problem with alphafold2 in decades which is arguably the most fundamental and high value problem in molecular biochemistry and biophysics data sets are more important than algorithms so big tech will always win this battle by the way alphafold came out in 2020 ai is not new jfc bull case fundamentals they get acquired and ber r fuk i will leave you with this quote from a machine learning review am reading this is far from the first time we have seen the use of the term artificial intelligence and the grandiose promises that it implies in fact the early 1950 s and 1960 s as well as the early 1980 s saw similar ai bubbles see this interesting summary by luke muehlhauser for open philanthropy muehlhauser 2016 these ai bubbles have been followed by what have been dubbed ai winters mcdermott et al 1985 tldr buy ai 421 20p or similar strikesexps to destroy the ai rally targeting a 12 bagger or don t i m not your fucking mother positions i will buy 10x of the aforementioned poots tomorrow they will likely be on discount due to the nvda sympathy pump
time to invest in $calm as eggs continue to go uo egg prices have soared 60 in a year resulting from the avian flu which caused the death of 57 million laying eggs hen i performed the analysis below to determine the impact on the supply 57 million laying eggs hen death resulted in a decrease of supply by 15 from last year here are the following reasons why the eggs will not moderate in the next 3 months 1 it takes 45 months for a hen to mature and start producing eggs 2 the demand for eggs is inelastic and consumers will not seek alternatives no matter what the price 3 avian flu continues to spread wildly which is different from what we saw in 2015 according to the cdc website last month the largest us egg producer calmaine foods $calm said the avian influenza outbreak would keep the overall supply of eggs tight until the national egglaying chicken flock is replenished $calm is the safest investment to benefit from higher egg prices as revenue continued to increase their revenue in the second quarter increased by 110 from last year the company pays 13 of its net income in dividends and has a clean balance sheet with no debt
qe for me qt for thee simple hypothesis for my fellow regards jpow don t give a fuck about you and me he s balling with his friends like jamie dimon so he has to help them out and the only tool he has to do it is an asset exchange facility where he can take long dated bonds off their balance sheets and let them go buy short dated tbills but at the same time his money honey jyell is telling him that he still has that little inflation thing to take care of or her sugar daddy joeb is going to go down in flames so what s a player to do is it bros before hoes or what jpow is like hold my beer here s what is up jpow is doing qe for the banks through his backstop facility printing money for them but in a way that isn t going to cause much inflation because it is technically an exchange program so that money doesn t make it to us ass clowns this takes the interest rate risk off the table for banks at the same time he is going to keep tightening on us regards by raising rates because he still wants to crush the jobs market and cool down inflation because let s face it he doesn t want to pay the pool boy more than minimum wage sure letting banks fail would have the same effect but then no one would come to his autobiography release party if he let the banks fail tldr qe for the banks qt for us and jpow comes off looking like a really stable genius

netflix so i m pretty bad at all this and don t know what i m doing that makes me fit right in i guess netflix is about to limit password sharing and force users to login through their home networks monthly at the end of march i m thinking for all the people that share accounts maybe this will somehow end up with people cancelling for example i use a buddy s hulu and he uses my netflix but if and when he can t access it anymore he could then theoretically cut my hulu access forcing me to either keep netflix and add hulu or drop something so my spending doesn t increase every article seems to be bullish on netflix so maybe i ll buy my first ever put and then follow up with a loss post anyone else think netflix is going to hurt themselves with this move

astrotechnical analysis i ve heard people say technical analysis is basically using astrology to make your trades and that s fine to see it that way and i think that s a very apt analogy like with astrology it gives you a structure to organize your thoughts and your position about that what you are discussing this diagram i drew demonstrates how technical analysis can help us make sense or what is happening and what can happen it gives us a structure to think about where it makes sense to try to buy in and where it makes sense to sell out the goal is to buy at the bottom of ranges and the seller if it breaks through the bottom of the range the goals to buy at the bottom of range and if it breaks above the next level either sell for profit or keep seeing where the company or the security goes
hate to piss on your parade it s the i told you so guy and i hate to piss on your inflation dead bro parade fellow regards inflation is already entrenched in the system it has moved from goods to services which is what 70 of us consumers spent on and it s nearly impossible to remove without a severe recessionwhich is nowhere in sight while the inflation in goods has been caused by supply chain shocks commodities spike and money printing those have pretty much gone away now however they have shifted toward services where labor costs are the main cause wages are very sticky and folks are not willing to take pay cuts just to save the economy from inflation at the same time people are still spending like no tomorrow so there are no reasons for businesses to stop hiring people or raising wages just take a look at retail sales 2023 x200b x200b wolf ritcher from wolfstreetcom has provided charts of the data for a 10 years period this is the total retail sales with 3 month average to smooth it out i draw the green line to show the average trend x200b x200b x200b where the fk are all you broke ass mfers got money to buy all these stuff do you think arthur burns oops i mean jay powell will cut rates with this kind of stupid spending he is raising rates to tame down on demands so you all stop spending he is asking you regards to stop buyingtrading monkey jpegs and imaginary tokens and do you really think he is succeeding do you think he is done with an unemployment rate at 37 do you think this time is different do you think the phillips curve and the law of economics will be suspended in midair for regards that don t know the phillips curve represents the relationship between unemployment and inflation you cannot have low inflation with low unemployment unless the inflation number andor unemployment number are rigged x200b x200b x200b conclusion jay powell has failed to get the us consumers to stop spending without a recession prices for services will not go down voluntarily rate cuts in 2024 will only pour gasoline on the inflation fire powell knows this he does not want to be known as arthur burns he is using one of the tools from the fed toolkit which is to jawbone you to think p1v0t is coming it s not the us economy is almost 70 consumers spending and until you monkeys stop spending there will be no recession there s no reason for him to risk inflation skyrocketing back up again with the markets up dow at record high spy close to record high the wealth efforts will pour more gasoline on the fire source

microsoft is in a much better shape than google or meta i really don t get it meta and google missed earnings hard microsoft at least exceeded earnings we can talk about some missed revenue from azure all day but if you compare the three microsoft is the safest and totally didn t drop the ball as much as people are acting like the 78 stock drop feels emotional i understand the google and meta cliff drop don t think microsoft one is justified seeing all these big companies miss earnings and see microsoft actually exceed makes me feel optimistic in the future i m obviously bullish on msft
trouble ahead for amazon what do you all make of recent newsresearch about amazon 1 bloomberg article couple months ago said amazon had expanded its logistics footprint too quickly and would be looking to sublease warehouse space source 2 cnbc reported that amazon is planning a second prime day event later this year why would amazon do this other than they have wayyyy too much inventory source 3 new data from retail research firm hibben shows that last week amazon prices actually fell for the second consecutive week also demand has been weak leading up to this week s prime day event not something you would expect if prices are already coming down source
nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit nvidia nvda is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others including advanced artificial intelligence processors according to nine sources familiar with the company s plans the dominant global designer and supplier of ai chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom ai chips and to protect itself from the growing number of companies interested in finding alternatives to its products the santa clara californiabased company currently controls about 80 of the market for highend ai chips a position that has sent its market value up 40 so far this year to $173 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023 its customers which include chatgpt creator openai microsoft msft alphabet goog and meta platforms meta have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative ai sector nvidia s h100 and a100 chips serve as a generalized allpurpose ai processor for many of those major customers but the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs doing so helps reduce energy consumption and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom ai chips that have flowed to rival firms such as broadcom avgo and marvell technology mrvl according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly if you re really trying to optimize on things like power or optimize on cost for your application you can t afford to go drop an h100 or a100 in there greg reichow general partner at venture capital firm eclipse ventures said in an interview you want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need nvidia does not disclose h100 prices which are higher than for the priorgeneration a100 but each chip can sell from $16 000 to $100 000 depending on the volume purchased and other factors meta has said it plans to bring its total stock to 350 000 h100s this year nvidia officials have met with representatives from amazon com amzn meta microsoft google and openai to discuss making custom chips for them according to two sources familiar with the meetings beyond data center chips the company has pursued telecom automotive and video game customers in 2022 nvidia said it would let thirdparty customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips the company has said nothing about the program since and reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time a nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company s 2022 announcement dina mckinney a former advanced micro devices amd and marvell executive heads nvidia s custom unit and her team s goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud 5g wireless video games and automotives according to a linkedin profile those mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after reuters sought comment from nvidia amazon google microsoft meta and openai declined to comment $30 billion market according to estimates from research firm 650 group s alan weckel the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year and double that in 2025 the broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023 which amounts to roughly 5 of annual global chip sales according to needham analyst charles shi currently custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by broadcom and marvell in a typical arrangement a design partner such as nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology but leave the chip fabrication packaging and additional steps to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co 2330 or another contract chip manufacturer nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into broadcom and marvell sales with broadcom s custom silicon business touching $10 billion and marvell s around $2 billion this is a real threat said dylan patel founder of the silicon research group semianalysis it s a real big negative there s more competition entering the fray beyond ai nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder ericsson 61qs for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer s graphics processing unit gpu technology according to two sources familiar with the talks 650 group s weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year ericsson declined to comment nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets according to sources and public social media postings weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20 a year and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the nextgeneration consoles from xbox and sony 6857 nintendo s current switch handheld console already includes an nvidia chip the tegra x1 a new version of the switch console expected this year is likely to include a nvidia custom design according to one source nintendo declined to comment x200b reuters

us msos stock prices at all time lows he stock prices of curleaf trulive green thumb cresco and others are at all time lows many investors in us msos have given up but consider the progress already made in 2023 and the possibilities in the 4 months in 2023 missouri and maryland started recreational sales minnesota and delaware legalized in november voters in ohio will likely legalize if ohio legalizes all big midwestern states illinois michigan and ohio will be legal in addition to minnesota pennsylvania legislators will introduce legalization when they return in fall pennsylvania is surrounded by legal states on three sides there is a reasonable chance pennsylvania legalizes in 2023 or early 2024 thus for state level progress 2023 was significant but as we have seen state level progress hardly impacts the stock prices of us msos only federal reform will cause the stock prices to surge on the federal level safe is likely to pass later this year which will be a big shot in the arm for the industry some analysts think safe may be enough for the us msos to up list to nasdaqnyse here is the reason safe will allow banks and financial institutions to serve marijuana businesses and allow banks to process proceeds to sales transactions safe in effect will declare that is legal for banksfinancial institutions to serve marijuana businesses and process transactions eg credit cards debit cards loans and financing if congress declares that it is legal for banks to process marijuana transactions that really means marijuana businesses are legal why would congress allow banks to serve marijuana businesses and process transactions if these activities are illegal congress cannot pass safe and at the same time hold marijuana businesses as illegal finally hhs will likely reschedule marijuana to schedule 35 or deschedule less likely in novemberdecember 2023 if safe is passed and rescheduling happens us msos will surge vertical so there is still the possibility for 2023 to turn out to be the best year for the us msos

gme cult thinks everything is about them barclays fine was not related the barclay s fine was not about gme it was about etns next conspiracy please or just talk about how drs of 20 will prevent other 80 of shareholders from being rational and selling a company with negative $500 million of ebitda when its valued at $7 billion and go ahead and ignore the fact that gamestop is falling apart with no inventory on hand
new controversial gme dd removed from supersubs because it s an arb play long gamestop short rocket labs usa i m not sure how up to date you are on the whole gamestop situation but rklb is heading for bankruptcy and gamestop is now their biggest competitor market cap isn t there yet but the company plan is on track also spacex is the target of every major corporation now rklb cant survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering space and burning unused inventory labor rights with their workers being violated rklb sounds great until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming gamestop is targeting rklb to be the epicenter space tourismasteroid mining this gamestop earnings has been massively anticipated and i believe rklb will continue to develop a negative correlation to gamestop so what do they have to do with each other competitors and gamestops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular
$coin how this icarus can make money so i made some great money short coin on their first big downfall this year glad i had some risk management because round 2 of my positions got absolutely fucking obliterated when blackrock pumped this shitheap the week before earnings my thesis was centered around reentering coin puts between 6070 for the inevitable shitting the bed at earnings with no major expected news or catalysts this slam dunk left me feeling secure as i went out of service camping in the beautiful rockies only to return to civilization to find out blackrock was fucking my shit up rip so some loss porn i had taken about half of my 120k original gain into coin for round 2 as of now i am going to assume most of that 60k is gone ngl 6 months of planning changed in one day didn t feel great but take that as a lesson why stop loss and some risk management can save a portfolio sure as hell did to mine anyway why i think there is now lots of meat on this bone $coin flew too close to the sun and now they have a very serious operating cost issue with a rapidbly closing revenue window first some fundamentals from their last earnings and future prospects they are seeing a decline in users especially in retail which is their bread and butter not only was the active users down more than expected in q2 their q3 and future outlook expected an additional decline between 1030 for retail users insitutional activity pretty flat and not much out of their forward guidance on improvement even with the blackrock pump about their partnership which i see at least in any immediate timeframe as a nothing burger $coin themselves are not prediciting any immediate impact into revenue or price action continued loss of global market share this doesn t look good for kreptoe thanks wsb us adoption in general effectively coinbase went after the generic taxpaying american user with a focus on operatering within the us financial system and not pissing off uncle sam at first i thought this was great during kreptoe mania and you can see if in their historical earnings it was a cash printing plan that would even make the fed blush find a way to bridge the most difficult thing that kept grandma from buying the magic internet money was the ui and link to traditional banking easy transfer between usd and kreptoe with a simple ui was genius but the price was to know your user and let the taxman know about all your assets as well as not directly holding cyrpto in your own wallet custodial services but now this is hurting them as kreptoe markets retreat and shake out more casual users these are the first audience to jump more hardcore kreptoe users likely don t want to pay high fees s have their assets under the nose of the taxman and probably don t want their assets in custodial services we can see the preference on kreptoe volume and global share for offshore exchanges not following activity of coinbase instead seeing more positive changes in trading volume on their exchanges multi failures to enter other markets this pairs with point 3 they really seem to be struggling to leave their little us niche after a fuck up of platform releases in the likes of india and a failed nft market i do not see coinbase being able to grow outside the us well which limits my scope of analysis to what they may to do in the us and to give a fair counterpoint the us market is the most valuable one but leaves them vulnerable to how us regulators decide to get involved regulatory headwinds we already know the sec has subpeoned them and has an open investigation to be honest i am not expecting the sky is falling from this i think $coin for the most part has been true to their original plan that they want to be compliant so i think high level execs randomly charged is just not on the table and major internet coin youu know which wsb are likely safe from a huge upheaval however all the altcoins have a bullseye on their back right now by regulators and they represent nearly 50 of coins ongoing revenue and activity trouble in altcoin land can quickly destroy a large portion of coins remaining revenue stream and my opinion is that the sec is going to look at the more speculative listings as securities operating costs and timeline they flew too close to the sun they thought kreptoe infinite money glitch for ever well i can t blame them for growing into exploding and mind boggling revenue but that is gone for at least the next 4 quaters even by their own predictions so they now have a problem where they need to innovate towards a new revenue stream while burning all their cash in the process i see this as being difficult to balance it is functionally difficult for an immature company with a need for growth to effectively cut costs while finding new revenue streams i am not optomistic now for some of the auxilliary blackrock when a player this big steps in you should always pay attention their recent 13f showed an increase in position sometime in the last months although their cost average is still above 130$ these guys pretty much increased their position and then said hey want to do a paternship shady i know but when you are this big and have a hand in everything well is what it is they also announced a buttcoin trust so on a face level this seems bullish for coin and investors certainly agreed rip my puts but i don t see this as an absolute the original announcement between being able to access coinbase prime from alladin is meh even coinbase doesn t believe this is going to do anything short term for them and kreptoe markets didn t seem very excited either if you want to be a us compliant financial instution you were limited by kyc already so as of now i look at this as more of qol change than actual money invested the ability to invest does not always mean the money will follow most institutions are not going to want a target on their back depending on the outplay of regulators kreptoe may not be that attractive of an investment and staking is still a massive grey area of risk primarily for how illiquid it is coinbase agrees also the future of major kreptoes is in question right now 60k buttcoin might be on a horizon too far out for instituional investors who would otherwise see little value in staking coupled with regulatory risk so here are the cases i see for each direction downside sec rules in anyform unfavorably for altcoins or kreptoe in general this further hurts kreptoe recovery altcoin revenue and can scare way institutions which is where coin is trying to pivot its revenue too they may alienate hardcore kreptoe users as well by trying to play compliant with regulators good for their instutional adoption who prefer the regulatory grey area of offshsore exchanges acceletrating the trend of users to them kreptoe prices flatline or drop either right now is revenue destruction people were happy to pay wild fees to coin when price up 5 in a day but continued kreptoe winter simply means less money in this impacts all their metrics trade volume users and revenue per user their fees are going to have to drop to remain competative upside cyrpto take off if kreptoe rockets again and buttcoin goes back to 60k well we will see what we saw before fucking eye watering mind boggling revenue favorable regulatory outcomes if regulators make coinbase the defacto exchange if don t want uncle sam down your throat this could be very beneficial to coin forcing us based institutions to them this may also protect their fees also if they don t consider altcoins securities this will protect their revenue a strong positive regulatory structure has the potential to legitimize kreptoe in the eyes of main institutions as well which willl help coin pivot from the retail mania wave that it started out in to a real institutional based exchange platform timeline price targets my original price target was 4050$ after last earnings which i think would have happened if blackrock didn t jam my jellies but that timeline is gone if kreptoe remains flatish the sec doesn t unexpectadly suck coin dick and september cpi doesn t show a steep fall off than i think investors will have to reevaluate the recent pump to $90 s in reality against revenue kreptoe trading volume is pretty easy to find online and through which exchange and it hasn t been getting better this continued trend is going to force another bad quater q3 which is coupled with further poor guidance i think will bring this stock price back to where it belongs 50$ my timeline is 930 as the most aggresive with bad cpi and 1209 to play november earnings and general dec sell off my strike target for those plays is 80 and 70 respectively i have some positions in but am currently waiting for a little of the volatility of the recent rally to clear down and get a better picture of how much legs this rally has i am not expecting any major downturn in price in the short term 90$ is just too sticky right now be on the watch for any indicication that kreptoe is about to rocket or that the sec may favor coin because in that case drop your puts like its the monkeypox and get on the call train because if retail volume trading explodes this company will start printing money again tl dr coin headed back below 60$ eoy with out a major boost in kreptoe pricesvolume and favorable sec outcome i wouldn t enter positions today or maybe even this week but keep an eye out for good entry the sucker punch blackrock can keep buying stock and keep pumping it by news releases about their future coin products whether this makes money or not also i am neither bullbear on the kreptoe just as far as i need to see how it impacts coin wsb rules make me talk like this dear mods please reign in the visual mod this isn t a kreptoe post godspeed

inflation decelerates slightly from 40year high as cpi rises 83 in april so this is the best spin they can put on this source article the bureau of labor statistics april consumer price index cpi rose 83 in april over last year coming down from march s 85 advance that rise had marked the fastest rate since 1981 consensus economists were expecting an 81 increase in april according to bloomberg the pace of price increases moderated but not as much as expected excluding a decline in energy prices which appears outdated by this point the increases remain widespread greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate said in an email wednesday morning inflation is still increasing but the best spin they can put on it is that it is slowing a little bit sounds like things are still bad but hey at least the rise has slowed a bityou re being priced out of things a little bit slower than before good times

regarding banks in order to make an informed decision for those tempted to invest in banks i d like to share what janet yellen is considering insured and uninsured deposits according to her svb and signature banks were outliers and the decision to secure all deposits was done in order to avoid contagion and probably because it wasn t the average joe it doesn t mean your deposits over 250k will be safe in other banks on that note why would anybody with over 250k leave their cash in any banks at all when they could earn 45 in 3months treasury notes usually those who have over 250k do their due diligence yellen on which deposits are secured and why svb and signature banks had all their clients secured
critical recession update we just entered into the 1 sigma birthing zone the cradle of recessions key takeaways below key takeaways 1 seven of the last eight recessions have started within the 1 sigma birthing zone which we just entered on july 20th 2023 the only recession that started outside of this zone did so less than 3 months above this zone 2 the projected start date of the next recession is estimated to be centered on early december 2023 461 months 3 there is a very high likelihood of 84 that a recession will start within the recently entered 1 sigma zone which spans over the next 922 months 4 currently there is a 16 probability that the next recession has already begun with the likelihood increasing rapidly from this point forward as time progresses 5 there is a high probability that the stock market will reach a peak highest price point within the next 38 months likely centered around a late august to early september 2023 time frame this will be preceded by a parabolic stock market blowoff top which will then be followed by a longterm secular stock market downtrend an enduring drop in stock market prices across the board lasting an average of 119 months once a trend is established it tends to persist 6 the stock market is expected to hit a trough its lowest price point indicating a bottoming formation sometime around late august 2024 this is a sign for averaging moving back into equities 7 as we progress through the 1 sigma birthing zone a secular downturn in the overall us economy is extremely likely to manifest itself with rising unemployment rates and deteriorating corporate earnings which will begin to gain momentum as the negative feedback cycle spirals downwards once a cycle begins it tend to perpetuate itself 8 and the 50day sma inversion has just begun to reverse its downward direction for the first time since the curve inverted 8 months ago a conformational signal that we are leaving the late stage of the business cycle just prior to the beginning of the economic contraction phase recession explanation of top diagram over the past 50 years inversions of the 50 day simple moving average sma of the deltas between the 10 year and 3 month daily treasury yield curve rates have all preceded the start of a us recession there have been no false indicators or exceptions to this rule and no recessions have occurred in the absence of these 50 day sma inversions the 8 recessions that occurred over the last half a century have started within an average of 1218 months from the first day that their 50 day sma inversions began explanation of bottom diagram this recession probability distribution illustrates the positions of the last eight recessions over a 50 year period these positions are superimposed on the probability curve with each recession s location based on the time from the first day of their corresponding 50 day sma inversions 10 yr minus 3 mo to the beginning of each recession the bestfit representation employs a normal distribution with a mean of 1218 months and a standard deviation of 461 months the solid red vertical arrow that is pointing upwards represents our current time position on the probability curve initiated from time zero the first day of the latest 50day sma inversion and sliding to the right as time elapses the prediction indicates a 50 likelihood that a recession will commence on or before early december 2023 with a greater than 95 probability that a recession will start on or before late july 2024

choppy chop chop 22823 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis well what was looking to be a pretty boring and untradeable day got to be a little exciting there eod i actually was very surprised to see bulls push it up like they did middle of the day as most technical did not really support a move like that however as seen below a perfectly timed tweet seems to have coordinated perfectly with that massive $313 sell off it is not common that we go coast to coast hod to lod but we sure did today x200b actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $12 to me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and cpi being hot however they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today with markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow x200b taking a look at spy here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here there is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel red inside of that that could very well be a falling wedge if that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 3974 tomorrow that level coincidentally enough was major support almost all day long the biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50200ema for the first time in over a month not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn t even touch it despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that i still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until spy closes back over 400 we also have an established supply level at 39642 that we did break back and close under today this level could turn itself into nice resistance here we have a large gap on supply back down to 38381 and upside to 41441523 after establishing demand at 4006 on 223 we retested that yesterday and rejected there we should with that rejection seek on next demand at 38866 unless we can establish a new demand this week first supply 39642 38381 demand 40062 38866 key spy support 3963 3954 3936 39144 key spy resistance 3973 3985 400 4006 x200b taking a look at es futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than spy i said i was worried that we could see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind however bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection crossing the daily 8ema below the 50200ema and closing under the daily 100ema now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here demand was established at 3975 on friday which could have provided a bigger push up however we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here with a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand however supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988 with a rejection off supply and also losing demand here i am very much so bearish on futures and i am looking for that 39153920 area to be touched i remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020 supply 3988 4020 demand 3975 3915 key futures support 3965 3945 3920 key futures resistance 3975 3990 4000 4008 4020 x200b tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today i would have expected more strength today leading into investor day however after establishing a supply zone at 2077 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 21424 and was unable to with that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 1963 however with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way supply 2077 21424 22475 demand 19629 16418 key tesla support 2056 2021 1978 key tesla resistance 2107 2142 2192 x200b kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the vix did not spike when we had that massive eod sell off it id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema but with a sell off of that size i would have expected more bounce there that could come tomorrow though one thing i did note that besides friday the pc ratio is very low this week on spy daily log x200b today was another really great day trading my only loss came from a put that i cut early on that huge run up overall a great day and a great week of trading so far this tight $3 range days with slightly elevated iv and extremely wicky volatile candles is making trading hard but so far so good extra patience in this type of market is always key

lunr based dd preface i am not an astrophysicist nor am i an acoustic space nerd this is my first space stock i am fairly new to investing in general this is definitely not financial advice i m sure this will be highly regarded going forward intuitive machines symbol lunr has launched novac to deliver payloads to the moon this will be the first moon landing completed by america in over 50 years and as far as i know the first moon landing completed by a private company the novac is only a day away from being in the moon s orbit and about two days away from landing the success in the landing will be a monumental moment for this company but also incredibly pivotal this will be revolutionary for the commercialization of space and the novac is just the beginning with goals of delivering payloads and eventually retrieving precious materials from space this company clearly has a strong future for more general information and more technical dd reference this post will it fail i was nervous to bet on the launch because we ve seen countless failed launches but how many failed landings have you seen we haven t landed on the moon in awhile but we have never failed an actual landing now to be fair we ve had failed moon missions because of technical difficulties in the spacecraft that occurred before the actual landing such as apollo 13 or intuitive machines leading competitor astrobotics recent failure because of a fuel leaknative american curse more on that later when have we ever failed a landing on the iss never now again i am not talking about missions being aborted before attempting touch down i am talking about the literal moment of landing which at this point is really all that s left for the novac we have never failed this if we have someone please send me a source most of this information was gathered in about 30 minutes is there still a chance we fail the landing of course are the chances of failing lower than ever yes our technology for trajectory and directional control in space has been stable for a long time breaking out of the atmosphere is the hard part the landing is straightforward especially for this company they specialize in accurate landings bard said this intuitive machines uses novac a singlestage lander designed for precise lunar landings and delivering payloads they leverage existing technologies and partner with other companies for specific needs they re landing tech is perfected beyond belief just look at this inspiring animation on this current mission they are set to deliver 5 nasa payloads that means fucking nasa trusts this company to handle their billion dollar instruments instead of just delivering it themselves apparently it s cheaper for nasa to deliver this way but either way that is a lot of trust this company will be responsible for all commercial payloads going forward they will have a monopoly on delivering custom contracted research equipment and other payloads to space here are all the payloads the novac is carrying x200b current update novac is expected to be in the moon s orbit by the 21st they plan on announcing the time of the landing tomorrow the 20th they are currently looking to land sometime in the afternoon on february 22nd and will be live streaming the event on their website i m planning on purchasing 1000 or so shares tomorrow i will post a screenshot when i do bonus bull their main competitor has literally been cursed by native americans astrobotic drummed up its own freight business packing the 6foottall 19metertall peregrine lander on board the lander a chip of rock from mount everest toysize cars from mexico and ashes and dna of deceased space enthusiasts including star trek creator gene roddenberry and science fiction writer arthur c clarke the navajo nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains saying it would be a profound desecration of a celestial body revered by native americans astrobotic chief executive john thornton said the december objections came too late but promised to try to find a good path forward with the navajo for future missions novac clearly has god on their side but do they also have anime we ll see tldr rocket go up stock go up

if you haven t heard this one already thought you all might appreciate this one if you haven t hear it already a hunter goes into the woods to hunt a bear he carries his trusty 22gauge rifle with him after a while he spots a very large bear takes aim and fires when the smoke clears the bear is gone a moment later the bear taps the hunter on the shoulder and says no one shoots at me and gets away with it you have two choices i can rip your throat out and eat you or you can drop your trousers bend over and i ll insert appropriate colloquialism for sodomy here the hunter decides that anything is better than death so he drops his trousers and bends over and the bear does what he said he would do after the bear has left the hunter pulls up his trousers and staggers back into town he s pretty mad he buys a much larger gun and returns to the forest he sees the same bear aims and fires when the smoke clears the bear is gone a moment later the bear taps the hunter on the shoulder and says you know what to do afterward the hunter pulls up his trousers crawls back into town and buys a bazooka now he s really mad he returns to the forest sees the bear aims and fires the force of the bazooka blast knocks him flat on his back when the smoke clears the bear is standing over him and says you re not doing this for the hunting are you

what s happening with biotech lately i m becoming more convinced that biotech was just another bubble waiting to burst as expected only the best are surviving firstly a bunch of biotech companies is constantly dealing with the fda then lawsuits then fda again and it goes on and on in recent cases for instance fibrogen is in the process of settling its mess over an anemia drug lots of companies accused of not disclosing fda investigations properly and it turns out it s not just investigations but potential patent revocations many other companies like bloom energy and kiromic had troublesome ipos and i won t even mention kiromic s performance in my view the fact that biotech companies are constantly facing lawsuits is a downward slide for all of them which signals a decline in performance and overall dynamics just my humble opinion tho so do you consider biotech promising and do you invest in it if yes what s on your top list and hope list also

es technical analysis by adam mancini only one pattern matters in es a perfect falling channel from march we hit support at 3630 4080 now resistance plan next week fill falling channel 3920 is resistance and if its to dip its here with 3890 385565 supports as long as they hold 3985 4085 next up levels and details in chart i am sure your thinking take this manure to rinvesting hear me out why do you think so many buy high and sell low they see price going up and they buy calls and as soon as they buy the price goes down they blindly purchase just before a resistance level or they see price going down and as soon as they buy puts the price starts going up again they purchase those puts right into a support level i know your probably not the brightest tool in shed i know your on your break from flipping burgers and don t have much time but listen to me technical analysis works it s just your getting your information from morons probably from wsb the crayon lines your looking probably are drawn by idiotic barely intelligible functioning members of society they don t understand how are they supposed to analyze what they don t understand okay they might be 23 people here in wsb who know technical analysis so you don t know anything about technical analysis and probably no one in your circle either you have a little of money to gamble you work hard at wendy s this is your hard earn money your tired of been poor you decided to buy options you don t know technical analysis how can you give yourself a chance with those options luckily for you there is a nerd out here that publishes accurate supportresistance levels his name adam mancini with over 134k followers he publishes supportresistance levels for es daily in his twitter account okay i should explain this since your probably slow es sp futures is almost identical to sp standard poor s 500 index during normal trading sessions and spy spdr sp 500 spy etf tracks sp i know what you will say that nerd who draws crayon lines is trying to sell me a newsletter for $23 a month you don t need it i am a subscriber i find it very useful and educational adam provides supportresistance levels bear scenario bull scenario his trading plan and his strategy your here in wsb to trade like adam you need a brain need to be disciplined need to be sophisticated need to be able to read price action need to be patient your working at wendy s your not a trader your a gambler okay so his levels useless to me no mate please read the following for you to understand a support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level a resistance level is the opposite of a support level this means that there are more sellers than buyers it is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises again this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level a previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up and conversely a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back once an area or zone of support or resistance has been identified those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because as a price reaches a point of support or resistance it will do one of two thingsbounce back away from the support or resistance level trading ranges or violate the price level and continue in its direction trading breakouts until it hits the next support or resistance level the basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sellsell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold therefore consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume the first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points once the asset trades beyond the price barrier volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout s direction breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases large price swings and in many circumstances major price trends when trading breakouts it is important to consider the underlying asset s support and resistance levels the more times an asset price has touched these areas the more valid these levels are and the more important they become at the same time the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to this doesn t happen all the time but when it does it is called a false breakout therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts markets regularly cycle between clean trend and choppy consolidation spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall usually after a large move in market a consolidation phase occurs after choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken everyone focuses on being smart but not being stupid is actually more important not being stupid is essential for survival do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance if you do either expect heavy losses buy calls when strong resistance shatters buy puts when strong support fails in other words for your yolo options trade break outs i probably will regret this but i will answer any question regarding supportresistance levels not responsible for how you use this information your money your decisions lotto tickets 01 dte options buying puts if price goes below 3795 buying calls above 3920

new wsb legend so the other day this guy bought meta 32250 calls expiring this friday worth all of his life savings roughly 35k the next day meta opened in the green and he was 50 up but as a true wsb legend he diamondhanded his way to a 10k loss in the afternoon selling every contract to make everything better he then proceeded to buy with the remaining money 218 contracts of 1550 calls of the company that shouldn t be named only to lose 60 today at the time of this post on those same contracts if you think this is the worst just take into consideration that those initial meta 32250 contracts today skyrocketed 150 so if he had diamond handed another day he would have actually managed to make some decent money truly a legend

billionaire warren buffett swears by this inexpensive investing strategy that anyone can try in the past 20 years investing in lowcost index funds like the sp 500 has come to dominate much of the investing landscape the reason it s cheaper than investing in most mutual funds there s far less trading which increases costs and the primary structure that is used to invest in index funds exchange traded funds etfs also have tax advantages no one can pinpoint the exact date when it became clear that investing in index funds had won out over investing in active management but warren buffett declaring it to be so was certainly a pivotal moment the year was 2007 buffett had entered into a bet with protege partners a new york city money management firm that runs funds of hedge funds that an index fund could beat an active manager source

my $002 which now has less than $0019 buying power i think the fed will go another 75 basis points in july but then they do not meet again until late september by that time the major indexes will be down from all time highs by between 30 and 45 ixic maybe more and i think unemployment will be starting to print summer will be ending gas will still be high and consumer spending will have continued to drop but the fed always starts late and ends later when it comes to hikes so they will hit the rate one more time in september but i am thinking 50 basis points for a total of 3 and i think this will become the new neutral the fed has been telegraphing for the past couple of years they are cool with 3 core inflation a relatively mild recession will be induced unemployment will go up but the fed won t lower rates to combat it this time there will be too much in play they will hold at 3 and wait the supply side bottlenecks are already unraveling oil demand may decrease after summer with a mild global recession depending on china libya and russia and opec of course and then we will have an economy somewhere between stagflation of the 70s and the fed money printing bubbles of the past 4 decades something more like trickle down 80s the markets will go sideways for a couple of years with 5 unemployment and less than 2 gdp and no free money and an average pe closer to 15 the fed may also let the balance sheet continue to unwind by aging off and when we get another bull market companies will have to do it with old fashion fundamentals as the fed keeps their powder dry for the next 2 or 3 years

$rivn rivian s losses nearly triple to $17 billion update rivian s losses nearly triple to $17 billion update by sean mclain dow jones rivian automotive inc reported its net loss in the second quarter nearly tripled to $17 billion further putting pressure on the electricvehicle startup to conserve cash and move quickly to fill customer orders the californiabased suv and truck maker said revenue for the quarter was about $364 million as it increased production and deliveries of its first three models rivian started manufacturing vehicles for the first time late last year the auto maker affirmed its 2022 production guidance of building 25 000 vehicles by the year s end but said its operating loss is expected to grow to $545 billion from its previous projection of $475 billion for the full year rivian said the figure was due to higher raw material and transportation costs as well as other supplychain issues rivian said it had trimmed capital expenditures and expected to spend $2 billion rather than its original projection of $26 billion at the end of june rivian had about $1546 billion in cash and cash equivalents about $15 billion less than at the close of the first quarter the results come as the startup enters the second half of the year a stretch in which rivian must prove that it can rapidly increase its production rate and deliver vehicles to tens of thousands of waiting consumers the company has said it produced 4 401 vehicles in the second quarter a figure it needs to more than double in each of the final two quarters to hit its target of 25 000 for the year rivian s ability to hit that target took on a greater sense of urgency as rising interest rates and inflation stoked fears of a potential recession the company last month said it would cut 6 of its workforce and slash spending rj scaringe the chief executive said the cuts were needed to ensure the company could meet its production goals without having to raise additional cash rivian s efforts to boost sales longerterm were dealt a blow this week with lawmakers proposing to add new restrictions to a $7 500 tax credit available to electricvehicle buyers the revisions would add a price cap to current subsidy making any electric truck and suv costing $80 000 or more ineligible for the federal credit rivian has said most of its vehicles sell for more than that amount as a result the company said the changes put it at a disadvantage to more established car makers who used the tax credit to grow their ev businesses the revised tax credit proposed as part of a broader climate bill in congress contains protections for customers who have made a binding contract to purchase a vehicle allowing those customers to qualify under the old tax credit system rivian recently emailed customers offering them purchase agreements to lock in future sales ahead of changes and allow them to qualify for the $7 500 tax credit as offered now last month rivian delivered the first of its batterypowered delivery vans to amazoncom inc the company has a contract to deliver 100 000 vans to amazon by 2030 mr scaringe has said production is improving at the company s sole factory in normal ill after overcoming initial problems that prevented the plant from operating at its full capacity rivian said the factory can produce up to 150 000 vehicles a year rivian shares have fallen 62 so far this year as the company has struggled to increase production write to sean mclain at seanmclainwsjcom end dow jones newswires

thoughts on rtx this is something i ve been sitting and watching for a minute and i am unsure if i want to jump in to this stock but it appears they have their stuff together over there they had an issue they took steps to correct it and it appears they did so pretty well the stock is still below where it was and there is a significant amount of movement taking place in the company they ve started this week with a nice little jump and i kind of feel like there s some momentum to be ridden here even if it s just returning to where it was originally also with the wars going on currently in the world wouldn t this also tend to fall into the gains territory for a stock like this to top it all off i ve heard two different conversations today randomly at that regarding rtx so i know people are talking about it in a positive light i genuinely feel like i should take this as a sign from the powers that be and just jump in already and i plan to do so this evening does anybody have any insight to offer on this
dd shows coinbase third quarter earnings will be less bad coinbase is manipulating their balance sheet to improve earnings what they re doing is locking a percentage of random accounts for a couple months to prevent them from withdrawing funds too quickly been trying to get them to unlock mine for a month and every day there s new users locked out they ll end up showing less bleeding in earnings from this and have good pr to fall back on about being financially responsible think their stock price is going to move up from these showing a potential stop to insolvency i wouldn t buy any yet i think it s going to fall more from my ta i ll buy when satoshi starts making new lows

uaw s standoff more than just wages at stake the uaw has initiated a strike generally i m not prounion take the uaw for example now that car prices have skyrocketed in the wake of their last contract the union is quick to demand a share of the massive corporate profits somehow i doubt they d be as eager to shoulder the burden of increasing component or energy costs however given the current climate i can empathize with workers wanting a wage boost for years markets and corporations have reaped the benefits of lenient monetary policies leaving workers grappling with soaring living costs their frustration is justified this situation also highlights why the fed might not be so free to roll out another qe should market issues arise the safety net the fed provides could become less reliablea point worth pondering

warning the us dollar is a scam do not invest the bretton woods aka gold standard rug pull back then the us guaranteed that the value of us dollar is pegged against the price of gold they suddenly dropped the gold standard with no warnings and ran away with 20 000 tones of gold this is a classical rug pull and many countries are very mad at the us for this the petrodollar scam the us scammed many poor countries out of trillions of dollars worth of oil they launched the opec scam where poor countries are required to sell all their crude oil for usd and usd only they forced many countries into adopting the petrodollar system they even fought wars in afghanistan and assassinated obasma bin laden just to force poor countries with lots of crude oil into selling their crude oil for usd now they are fighting russia since russia refused to sell crude oil for usd the fed can print as much usd as it want literally giving them unlimited free crude oil the biggest stock market manipulation scam ever the fed planned every stock market rallies and crashes in advance their stupid monetary policies manipulate the economy in the fed s favor if they want the stock market to crash they raise their stupid interest rates and make everyone sell stocks and buy debt securities and if they want the stock market to rally they decrease their stupid interest rates and make everyone move to stocks since their savings paid very little interest the inflation scam whenever the us government is short on money the fed prints money this created severe inflation that severely hurt their citizens back then you only need a few hundred dollars to buy a car now you need a lot more what can we do move all your wealth to fedresistant assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies asap
the autists guide to inflation listen up before you pop your morning dose of adderall and give your wife s boyfriend a foot massage let me clue you in on something really important the masters of the economy and hence the master of the remains of your tech portfolio are shit scared of inflation jerome powell the fed charlie munger biden wallmart wallstreet and everybody else is shitscared of inflation your mother is scared of inflation how will she pay for your wetabix and xbox games tomorrow what is inflation though common knowledge is that it is the increase of price levels by a surplus of money or a shortage of things too much money chasing too few things stuff gets more expensive too little money too many things stuff get cheaper so far so easy there is however a psychological component to it companies adjust prices and production preemptively based on their future expectations in order to protect their inventory and shield themselves from compressed margins they might produce way more than forecasted or adjust forward pricing based on their expectations on their rising cost and higher sales prices producers might start hoarding parts as they might be more difficult to obtain down the road the great chip shortage appears to be greatly intensified due to the fact that everyone and their mother order way more than than they need just to ensure the other guy is not snatching their inventory this is a really hard problem to tackle in times of super intricate global supply chains that try to get everything just in time because warehouses and inventory are surprisingly expensive this is also why amazon will rather burn your returns than deal with them with any degree of intimacy so as a business owner you have to predict the demand for your stuff the availability of the stuff you need the prices of the stuff you need etc super hard remember everybody has to do it for themselves and the guess what the others are doing so like when people are rushing into a stock you have these selfreinforcing systems george soros calls this reflexivity this worked surprisingly well for the last 30 years there is only one issue the whole organism of global trade is much more fragile than anyone expected so when this happened x200b the shitshow that was the last two years the models did not really capture the dynamic nature of reality completely the infinite money glitch from the fed was just the icing on the cake so what we got was a perfect chaos and weird hard to predict effects like negative oil prices liquidity bubbles in housing stocks sneakers etc weird shifts in demand due to work from home and 7 billion people changing their lifestyle completely all at once used cars costing more than new cars gpu s retailing for 3x the normal price a global shortage of toilet paper an insane shortage and price bubble in lumber and construction prices this send shocks up and down the supply chain as today prices very dependent on expectation of tomorrows prices it caused a lot of distortions very similar to how the stock market works where future expectations make up 90 of the whole valuation so with everyone guessing hard what will happen next you can end up with something like this the bullwhip effect httpsenwikipediaorgwikibullwhipeffect as our good friend michael j burry points out here so nicely is that the dog has a really long tail and that the predictions of all the market participants when it comes to inventory prices and supply drive a really really long tail this brings us to the problem of measurement as you might have heard the means to measure inflation predate the second world war and not really doing a good job or even attempt to model the chaotic nature of reality described above you buy a couple things that are roughly the same each month cpi you try to smoothen it a bit by excluding strongly fluctuating food energy items core cpi you ask about of producers how the are feeling about the economy ppi and then you can estimate where you are right now you can try to make a prediction by drawing the line a bit further out but this is as helpful as technical analysis on penny stocks that we all are so tired off one should keep in mind that these are simplified mental model based on our incomplete information of the parameters involved and the inability of the human mind to grasp the incredible complexity of large scale chaotic systems or as my good friend jerome powel uttered on yesterday we overshot a tiny little bit maybe federal reserve chair jerome powell admits we now understand better how little we understand about inflation and insists 41year high prices were unpredicted so what that all really means is that the inflation we are measuring today is something that potentially is caused by effects that are long past us due to the nature of long intertwined supply chains and relatively comprehensive disruptions of shipping and transportation markets we really have no clue when and how today s numbers where actually made so if nobody knows anything at all why am i even even reading this the answer is that there are clues of what happens next in order to get a feeling where we are right now lets have a look of the start of any physical supply chain commodities coming down good already as you can see these are not charts of runaway prices there are of course spikes for instance in lithium but commodities as a whole have relaxed quite a bit from the recent peaks lets have a look at some shit people are actually buying instead of some madeup basket from the last century gpu prices are coming down hard https retail shelves are full again used car prices have leveled off https and everyone s darling investment homes prices start coming down in some areas as a result of quickly increased lending rates shipping cost is on the retreat too httpsfbxfreightoscom so these are just some isolated and of course cherry picked examples but it should illustrate that things are a little a lot more nuanced than the redhot monthly readings are suggesting it might actually be that inflation has already peaked and the worst is behind us which leads us to the most interesting question should i buy calls or puts now well this really depends as you maybe know the fed uses interest rates to accelerate or brake the economy by making money cheaper or more difficult to borrow in simple terms this works because the more money you have the more shit you can trade and make and buy less money is taking the oxygen out of the room lets overlay the fed balance sheet which is a reasonable benchmark for money supply with the sp500 to see if we can spot any correlation how much two lines like each other a little bit of overlap maybe https as we can see they are somewhat correlated so to summarize when inflation numbers are high the fed raises rates in order the choke the economy a bit as a consequence the price of shit goes down or at least does not raise anymore when inflation numbers are low the fed can push the pedal a bit more and make money more widely available this makes everyone a bit richer and stimulates the economy this is desirable as it means more jobs and more shit to buy in general historically the markets are relatively resilient they survived the great depression world wars oil shocks and what not generally investors are fine as long as they have a feeling where things are going right now nobody really knows shit and these inflation readings are the number everyone is focussing on because it will in last consequence mean the difference between another bull mania or a long and painful bear market so should i buy puts are calls now for fucks sake easy if you take the blue pill you are on team bear gang you submit to the great uncertainty and you are scared of runway inflation you buy puts because you believe it will be necessary to kill the economy for a quarter or two to bring down inflation if you take the red pill you are on team burry and make the bold contrarian bet that inflation has already peaked and it is likely that we see a nice reversal especially in the battered down tech sector zuck i still love you you buy calls because you buy when there is blood in the streets and the worst is already behind us it you take the pill with the mitsubishy logo you are team smoothbrain and believe it does not matter because we will have a strong reaction either way and the vix at 29 is super low edit for how shit the market is considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently so you buy puts and calls because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet or we have another faceripping rally like in 2020 edit to time your bets better please consult the bls calendar the next cpi reading is on jul 13 2022 x200b tldr nobody knows what is going to happen but there is opportunity in guessing how wrong we are about inflation position 110 shares of voo 261 disclaimer i have no idea about any of this shit and this dd is just prose so check everything and invert yourself this is a casino x200b edit repost as first one was deleted for accidentially mentioning a banned

bridgewater s jensen sees stocks bonds dropping up to 25 greg jensen cochief investment officer of bridgewater associates expects that equities are facing a significant drop to align them with the real economy in aggregate the asset markets will decline from 20 to 25 he said in an interview with bloomberg television speaking with kailey leinz and guy johnson on bloomberg markets the market is pricing a decline in inflation to occur in a relatively stable economy he said but isn t factoring in the impact of higher interested rates and the federal reserve s quantitative tightening jensen expects that qt and rate hikes will drive down both inflation and economic growth and unfortunately the inflation will be more stubborn resulting in higher interest rates across the curve particularly on the long end asset prices will also fall he said they need to decline citing a big disconnect between the financial economy and the real economy we re still 25 to 30 above the normal relationship between cash flows and asset prices if the fed is forced to tighten longer in the face of stubborn inflation and an expected easing in six to nine months doesn t materialize he added this will make a tough road for assets in which liquidity dries up as profits and economic growth are weak when asked how to invest in this market he said that you are not going to be able to totally avoid this for investors who are long only jensen advises lowering risk and being more diversified both globally and environmentally globally he expects the euro area economy will contract 4 in the next 6 to 12 months with the policy makers facing difficult choices between battling inflation and fostering economic growth china is facing a very dangerous situation dealing with the economic slowdown debt and real estate bubble at the same time the nation is dealing with tensions over another covid19 outbreak and taiwan the fact that china does supply side stimulus while refusing to do the demand side stimulus is also a problem he said source stocks are facing a significant drop to align them with the real economy according to greg jensen cocio of bridgewater associates he expects in aggregate the asset markets will decline from 20 to 25 do you agree that stocks could fall further to 25

new market hypothesis i m testing with positions i followed my own advice and applied my system to a larger set of assets it appears that amc could go to $24 if any of you care to know just thought i d do that research for anyone who is in amc as a form of encouragement for those who helped me through my own episode of mania for those who are interested here is how i ve been pricing my prediction for amc we know that the market is a nonlinear system that defies prediction most of the time by most actors in that system we also know that each individual investor and trade occurs in a universe with physical laws which include nonlinear physical systems it is also known that for a variety of physical systems that something called the principle of least action applies wherein the kinetic and potential energy of a system want to always be in balance so that they cancel each other out we also know that people such as myself are prone to fits of mania fear and greed the question i then asked myself was knowing this is it possible to efficiently find an equilibrium for an asset that can be used as a potential benchmark of future performance that is when a stock is below that equilibrium price and we buy provided waiting through market chaos do line go up so far i have found in other tests without capital that it very much does
inflation has peaked there s one inflation gauge that bucks the trend the new york fed s often overlooked uig believes us inflation is past its peak whenever there s an economic consensus on anything it s worth considering how it might be wrong there seems to be general agreement that inflation and rates will be higher for longer and team transitory has been defeated but what if we are at an inflection point on inflation this is the question policymakers should be asking by one key measure inflation in the us has already peaked in fact it peaked in march the same month that the federal reserve began raising the benchmark rate the new york fed s underlying inflation gauge has largely been ignored for decades that s understandable and not just because of the snoozer of a name there wasn t any significant underlying inflation in the years after the global financial crisis while the fed and financial markets are fixated on the 2 per cent inflation target the uig isn t primarily a level forecast its real value is in predicting inflection points it correctly anticipated the lasting high inflation we are now observing and while it s still high the uig is suggesting it will be abating the media and the public are obsessed with the consumer price index while the fed s target is based on the personal consumption expenditures index both can be noisy since they include the prices of volatile items such as energy and food but they are not the only price measures the atlanta fed tracks nine other indicesopens a new window for inflation that aim to strip out noise they show inflation somewhere between 47 and 73 per cent in september most of these gauges remove data to try to identify underlying inflation core cpi excludes energy and food costs for example while trimmed mean and median measures strip out components with the largest changes in prices to smooth out the index but the risk with these indices is that they can miss large price moves up or down that could be a signal of inflation changing direction the uig is constructed differently removing noise rather than items from the index the idea is that movements in trend inflation happen alongside related changes in the trends of other economic and financial factors the index looks at moves in prices the labour market financial markets and the real economy every month and checks the historical data going back to 1995 to see if similar moves had previously lasted at least a year if so they are included in that month s uig and if not they are filtered out as noise you really can t use the uig to forecast the level of inflation as has sometimes been suggestedopens a new window where it matters is in showing when the inflation trend is changing and on this it has a decent track record in both normal and unprecedented times when cpi hit a peak in 2018 for example uig clearly showed the peak while core cpi and trimmed mean and median indices suggested inflation would continue rising in mid2009 uig showed a trough in inflation while the other measures took another year to reach a nadir what about during the pandemic core cpi did a good job of signalling a bottom for inflation in mid2020 before rising but dipped in the third quarter last year wrongly suggesting that inflation would come down the trimmed mean and median inflation indices failed to indicate a shift towards higher inflation showing a trough more than six months after cpi and core cpi uig found a bottom roughly in line with headline cpi and then started a steady climb upwards rightly ignoring the slump in the third quarter of 2021 of these metrics it provided the earliest and most reliable signal for a rise in underlying inflation the fed is now looking for signs that trend inflation has peaked and that monetary tightening is bringing inflation back towards its target much to its alarm core inflation dipped in the second quarter of this year before accelerating in august and september median and trimmed mean inflation have been on a steady upward climb with no signs of stabilisation but the uig peaked in march 2022 stabilised at high levels and has been gradually falling since july all the different gauges for inflation suggest it is way above the fed s target but we know monetary policy works with long and variable lags and there is a danger overtightening could spark a recession the central bank aims to look through transitory factors and set policy based on the underlying trend the uig shows the trend is finally starting to reverse course with rates now restrictive that suggests it s time for fed officials to consider slowing their tightening path

more gex and how to have it so as the four of you who still have money in their account since my last post will remember gex is a cumulative picture of how many options positions are around the bid and what mms have to do in order to satisfy their hedging requirements to maintain a neutral position to the option and eat very nice waigu steak off the margin your terrible positions pay them you can tell i m a bit more saucy than last post both chemically and contextually and i will make today s post rather short sweet and helpful to some or not i make zero dollars if you make or lose money but i started out here and paid my dues so perhaps a bit of knowledge won t kill you or at the least can lower your tuition to get into the game many of you here trade options which is like a futures contract for poor people and like most poor people things falls apart rather quickly due to theta options do however have the great value of allowing you to pretend for a brief few days that you own 100 shares of a stock you can never afford and give you the existential dread of a margin calls however understanding gex and being attentive to your options can pay off in useful ways let us start off with some basic facts that a few of you remember and more of you have dunning kruger d yourself in believing you don t need high gex means stock price no want to move sad panda low gex means stock price move all over the place frightened panda negative gex means mms sell when market sells buy when market buys murder death panda now theta is the killer in options because the clock is always ticking on your position the one smart person here is shorting bonds long term has figured out that higher volatility can permit faster moves to new price levels so if you believe a price will move in a direction soon your options are more likely to make a strong directional move faster in higher volatility so lower gex so negative gex is best for a quick score of i don t know you guys sell at $20 right is that what crack costs now uzjz what does crack cost now i m sure you know anyway i mentioned in that previous post that gex changes during the day and it would be sporting of me to help you figure out how that changes gex will get lower as it gets away from the recent average price and higher as it approaches the recent average price how recent is your problem figure it out but if i mention opex maybe that will help so when we re already in low gex and getting away from average price be wise in thinking about where the market is strong or weak and place your bets make your positions in the market today was a good example of this so it came to mind earlier and i thought i d say something that was some great chop today and options could make some money unless you bought that head fake up to the opening range around 2pm ouch

tfw your cynicism about the ai craze blinds you to the fact that trends make money through all this both skepticism and cynicism have blinded me to nvidia a share price approaching previous ath while i was busy decrying executives desire to employ ai in place of creatives and drive the final nail in the coffin that is arts and creative work as a source of reliable livable income the obsession with chatgpt as if it s some sentient all knowing oracle and not just the mosaic plagiarism machine it is and the obsession with literally saying everything is or has ai i never once thought hey you do like nvidia products and the company why not buy up some of those shares you let go of early last year you know you got a nice pump from nvidia in december 2021 maybe it s time to at least play them long again

we are making money too hard on ourselves so i ve been observing stocks for the last six months i understand the group wanting to go to stocks that has been around for quite some timeare about to die however i feel all of us could make the most money by investing in new ipos pushing the ipos price up and reaping the benefits of our work obviously there is some risk with this for example if you sell too late you re going to miss out on the profit that could be made however the individuals that push the product and the individuals that are following along with the company will have enormous gains so just food for thought

how and why the crisis will happen start here to learn the basics you can skip to the conclusion at the very bottom i wrote this a few months ago for my friends in tech and the more time passes the more correct it turns out to be so i wanted to share it with more people hope it is useful to yall the current nonfarm unemployment rate stands today at 36 in the us as of april 2022 source the current cpi inflation rate today stands at 83 counting food and energy source you can control inflation by raising interest rates raising interest rates makes it so people loan less money loaning money is how money is made for the most part it happens because of the money multiplier effect which works kinda like this imagine i m a bank and you deposit 100 dollars with me well as a bank i am legally required to keep 10 of deposits in storage this is called required reserve rates just in case you want to come and take money out so from your $100 deposit i loan out $90 to person 1 person 1 now takes that loan and spends it wherever he wants but i have to keep $9 of those $90 in storage by law so i can loan out $81 to person 2 and so on money multiplier effect if we make accounts and sum out all the money that i have as a bank it s 10090817296561 and so on in total for just these accounts you see on the graph i as a bank can lay claim to $71757 total that s called the money multiplier effect there s more to it but that s the gist now how do you stop all this money creation you make it very costly to loan money usually the fed raises interest rates but they cannot simply raise interest rates across the board what they do is raise the federal funds rate which is the interest rate at which banks can lend each other money which eventually trickles down to the interest rate by which we get loaned money federal funds rate vs inflation when the fed wants to rein in inflation they raise interest rates very high above inflation now you have also noticed the big spike there in the middle left of the graph this was a period of incredibly high inflation in the us during the 70s and 80s it was solved by a man called paul volcker who s revered today among economists the federal reserve at the time was unwilling to raise interest rates because it would cause a recession and kill jobs but the persistant inflation problem was too much so the chairman of the fed was fired and replaced with paul volcker paul went on to raise interest rates to such incredibly high levels that it caused a recession and raised the unemployment rate to double digit numbers people sent him threats and 2x4s where construction workers wrote you are killing our jobs but the man persisted once inflation came down it remained down in the us ever since we have enjoyed almost miraculous levels of stable 2 inflation since in the eu they had 26 bouncing around turkey between 630 and mexico 230 however the work of paul volcker only reaches so far today inflation rate is soaring high again why do we not just raise rates again quickly because high inflation in the short term produces lots of jobs x200b the phillips curve now despite the fact that this graph says wage inflation because it is trying to explain a single phenomenon it actually applies to all inflation high inflation creates low unemployment here is why imagine you want a widget that costs $90 it costs $90 next week and the week after no problem at all but now imagine this widget instead cost $90 now and $95 next week and the week after $100 if you want this thing you better buy it now an increase in the speed at which people spend because they have to buy everything right now means businesses have more business because everyone is spending so much so they hire more people ok so whats the problem why does this have to end enter the michel burry graphs this is the only site i could find them i m not an internet coin guy this graph is for debt for consumers think credit cards for example this is consumer savings the first graph is consumer credit outstanding meaning the amount of debt consumers have for example credit card debt the second graph is personal savings which is just what is sounds like the amount of savings people have in their account michael burry said of this of twitter us personal savings fell to 2013 levels the savings rate to 2008 levels while revolving credit card debt grew at a recordsetting pace back to the precovid peak despite all those $trillions of cash dropped in their laps source is the article above the graphs why are people doing this is this a failure of personal responsibility maybe but not likely here is the mechanism of why inflation actually predicts this lets go back to that $90 widget imagine that not only is the widget going from $90 to $95 to $100 but your total personal savings are $100 if you need this widget then you will buy it immediately and kill your savings usually this is the stopping point for runaway inflation even if companies keep raising prices consumers simply wont buy them because they ran out their savings so companies go easy on the pricing and consumers slowly build back up their savings you have probably done this as well i imagine at least one of you when gas prices were first rising from $2 to $4 decided to fill up your gas tank at 3$ just in case next week prices were even higher and you were right well why has this not stopped why are prices rising and why are people taking out loans here is why imagine you take out a loan for $100 with a 5 interest next week and inflation is say 2 next week you will owe adjusted for inflation $100 $5 in interest $2 in inflation $103 total now imagine that inflation is at 4 $100 $5 interest $4 inflation $101 total taking out loans has gotten a lot cheaper in adjusted terms what if interest is also very low well today interest stands at around 075 going up to 1 so now imagine low interest rate and high inflation $100 $1 interest $7 inflation $94 total you now owe less in real terms by taking out a loan which you then use the money multiplier effect and you can see why all these things combined have been so bad tldr in conclusion the federal reserve will be forced to raise interest rates by a lot which will increase unemployment crash consumer spending and make a temporary but hopefully controlled intentional recession

dry bulking companies discussion i ve been looking at zim and the dry bulk industry in general because all of the prices are incredibly depressed their liquid assets alone are almost equal to their stock price they have little debt they turned a profit for the first time this year and the pe is 1 right now the reason why dry bulking and zim are low is because of china s corona outbreak and the war in ukraine but those can t go on forever and the demand will inevitably rise at an all time low price of $3449 this weekend its a must buy right any advice fellow retards edit i have changed my opinion on short squeeze possibility because the short interest that i had found was outdated

uranium energy uec first of all uranium energy has the advantage of an extremely strong balancesheet which contains no debt at all currently the company is in possession of 466000 lbs of strategic uranium inventory at an average cost of around 34$lb the company has been able to sell 3150000 lbs of uranium during the fy 2023 at an average price of 52 05$lb which resulted in around 163950000$ assuming that they will manage to keep the average price of 52 05$lb the strategic reserves have a value of at least 8411300$ the average market price has been 51 24$lb over the fy 2023 which shows that the company has been capable of selling their product above market price on feb 7th 2023 after the russian attack on ukraine has started the us legislation has ban the import of russian uranium into the united states just after the european parliament passed a resolution on the 2nd feb 2023 with 489 votes in favour that calls for an immediate and full embargo on eu imports of uranium from russia and sanctions on russia s rosatom on oct 24th 2023 the nuclear fuel security act got approved by the house energy and commerce subcommittee that will establish and expand critical us nuclear fuel programs to boost domestic uranium mining production enrichment and conversion capacity obviously the sanctions on russia as well as the on the 23rd of october established bill support the companies actions as well as the pricing of their uranium since demand is surging and supply is struggling to keep up and since the us iswas importing around 90 of the uranium fuel used in domestic nuclear reactors from foreign countries there is a certain risk factor that shouldn t be skipped to talk about threads to the nuclear supply chain of the us can have a severe impact on the countries energy supply therefore many us representatives support a shoring up of domestic uranium mining production enrichment and conversion capacities uranium energy uses a miningmethod called insitu recovery in some parts also known as insitu leaching this method is much more sustainable and efficient than digging a large pit and carrying the uranium rich soils with large trucks back to the processing facilities the insuit recovery method is a form of solution mining where the minerals of a earth layer which contains uranium gets washed out and collected the pregnant and mineral rich solution then gets pumped back to the surface where the minerals can be recovered those get filtered and in the end after a series of different filter methods and a drying process the company has successfully extracted a kind of uranium powder called yellowcake ready fore sale currently there are two main hubs in the us which the company is trying to expand one in wyoming with a licensed production capability of 25m lbsyr and another one in texas with a licensed production capability of 4m lbsyr of 7 projects in wyoming 4 have already been permitted in texas its 3 out of 5 both mining sites are mining u3o8 it is generally considered to be one ot the more attractive forms of uranium for disposal purposes because under normal environmental conditions u3o8 is one of the most kinetically and thermodynamically stable forms of uranium therefore reducing the risks of fatal failures or incidents dramatically after cameco and orano uranium energy now controls the largest diversified resource base hosted in multiple assets in canada s athabasca and thelon basins the expansion site in canada has a land position for future growth opportunities of approx 1136083 acres uec also acquired the roughrider project a developmentstage from rio tinto for 1462m$ planning on an initial assessment economic study and completing further delineation drillings to upgrade the current inferred resources in the purchased developmentstage the project is already licensed for toll milling which should speed up the process of collecting revenue at the site drastically in total uec is in possession of a large portfolio of uranium mining sites across north and south america they are currently the fastest growing uranium producing company out there the fact that carbon emissions are tried to be reduced by almost every western county on this planet provides a sensational growth opportunity statistically speaking there are more people dying by co2 poisoning a year than due to an atomic catastrophe this may also be a reason why many countries besides germany for example are expanding on their uraniumpowerplants to lower their carbon footprint while still being able to provide a reliable energy source to their economy the reactor demand exceeded primary production significantly so that there is an estimated supply gap of 52m lbs worldwide by 2033 this gap is expected to grow to almost 480m lbs nuclear power faces the lowest levelized cost of electricity for extended life plants vs any other source of energy so not only is nuclear energy safer and cleaner than other

your lotto play for amd s earnings tonight is it time already for another earnings post last week was killer let s see about this week advanced micro devices amd is set to release its firstquarter 2023 results today afterhours in recent weeks analysts have lowered expectations and amd probably has a low bar to clear for this quarter amd s recent quarterly reports have been subpar with the company and the semiconductor industry in general grappling with supply issues with the economy seemingly headed toward a hard landing amd s financial performance has probably not bottomed yet for this semiconductor cycle so far in 2023 amd s stock has rallied big time however we need to take a closer look at the company before joining the amd bandwagon ahead of its q1 report in today s post we will preview amd s upcoming report and evaluate the stock to see if calls or puts will be the play specifically for earnings today what is the earnings forecast for amd in their q4 2022 earning press release their management guided for q1 2023 revenues to be in the range of $5$56b and this guide fell short of consensus analyst estimates of $56b furthermore the guide for nongaap eps also fell short of estimates however the market somehow reacted positively to amd s er with the stock jumping up 18 in just two postearning sessions as investors seemingly looked beyond the immediate results and guidance well that s not all amd s management had some good news for investors from the q1 earnings call transcript you can see that amd s management sees macro headwinds lasting through the first half of this year however they see the demand environment improving in the back half of 2023 with emerging technologies like ai set to drive greater demand for amd s products for years to come now amd s management has a history of underpromising and overdelivering and so we may very well end up with betterthanexpected results from advanced micro devices in 2023 i believe that the longterm dynamics driving amd s growth will continue for many more years in this challenging macroeconomic environment amd is increasing market share across all of its business categories even if its nearterm financial performance is expected to remain under pressure unfortunately in this environment negative growth rates are unlikely to go unpunished and amd stock may continue to decline after its q1 report particularly if amd fails to meet the revised consensus expectations before we look into consensus analyst estimates for q1 2023 let s briefly review amd s q4 2022 earnings report to understand ongoing business trends how was amd s previous earning report in q4 2022 advanced micro devices revenues grew by 16 yy to $56b with growth in its data center and embedded business segments being offset by client and gaming business lines while amd delivered a marginal beat on revenues eps fell short of expectations eps normalized actual $069 beat by $002 eps gaap actual $001 miss by $020 revenue actual $560b revenue surprise beat by $8293m amid a sharp decline in global pc shipments amd has been under shipping in its client business segment over recent quarters which saw a 51 yy drop in q4 2022 for 2023 amd is planning for the pc total addressable market tam to be down 10 for 2023 with the second half of the year expected to be far better than the first half according to idc global pc shipments fell by 29 yy with shipments being hurt by weak demand excess inventory and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions its client and gaming segment revenues also declined yy due to the current demand environment now despite amd s business becoming data center centric over the last few quarters amd s growth outlook remains challenging until the global pc market weakness persists as economic strength wanes amd s gaming business has also come under pressure in recent quarters and this trend continued in q4 2022 for 2023 amd s management expects client and gaming segment revenue to decline for the full year 2023 due to lower demand more alarmingly amd s management has expressed caution on the data center segment for h1 2023 due to some of its major cloud customers having high levels of inventories revenues from the data canter segment which had been a major growth engine for amd during 2022 increased 42 year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022 amd s embedded business section is expanding significantly along with its data centre business segment however this expansion is due to amd s strategic acquisition of xilinx i ll be keeping a close eye on the embedded segment in the upcoming quarters to understand the real trajectory of this business for the last several years amd has been winning market share across its various end markets and amd is continually adding new and improved products across its segments which means that the market share gains are likely to continue in the coming years among these innovations are amd s ryzen 7040 cpu series ryzen 7045 cpu series and radeon rx 7900 series graphics cards the new graphics cards built for gaming laptops providing 26 higher performance on average than previous generation raedon graphics amd also announced the availability of three new ryzen processors adding to the portfolio of highperformance pc products for desktops and mobiles in the tobereported quarter on top of a sharp revenue growth deceleration amd s financial performance is suffering under the weight of margin compression with a supply glut forcing inventory writeoffs among semiconductor companies in recent quarters amd s margins have tumbled lower in q4 amd s nongaap operating margins came in at 23 down 400 bps yy here s a graph on their operating margins in each segment over the last 5 quarters the company attributed the fall in the client segment s margin to lower revenue however the decline in data center margins was attributed to additional rd and gotomarket investments to support the next phase of amd s revenue growth in upcoming quarters i d like to see an improvement in amd s margin profile however things are unlikely to get better until the macroeconomic environment eases off is amd expected to beat earnings according to consensus analyst estimates amd is set to deliver total revenue of $531b for q1 2023 and the range of these estimates is from $525b to $550b higher end of management s guidance for this quarter eps normalized actual $056 eps gaap actual $002 revenue actual $531b over the last three months amd has received 24 downward revisions for q1 2023 revenue as analysts scamper to adjust to management s lowered guidance as of today the consensus analyst estimate for amd s q1 revenue sits at $531b in line with the midpoint of management s guidance range the consensus outlook for amd s revenue has been trending in the wrong direction over the last couple of quarters or so however the earnings outlook is getting markedly worse that said amd is already a cashgenerating machine and with scale profitability is only going to get better in the future based on recent business trends management s guidance and earning revisions i think amd is not likely to deliver a beat on consensus expectations and even if we do get a beat from amd the quantum of the beat may be minimal and i am currently working with a q1 2023 revenue projection of $53b midpoint of management s guidance how are the technicals amd s chart looks far better than it did six months ago however the stock seems to be forming a rising wedge pattern and a breakdown to the $7280 range is likely given the rollover in rsi macd and trading volumes while amd s stock has continued to climb up in recent months its earning estimates have been shifting lower interestingly there are no sell ratings from wall street firms on amd at this time yet the upside potential that analysts are predicting from here isn t huge with a consensus analyst price target of $9772 wall street sees an upside potential of just 10 in amd so what to do for earnings advanced micro devices inc remains a fundamentally sound business and going into the q1 2023 report i continue to like it as a longterm investment but for earnings there seems to be a mixed bag of good news and bad news making it difficult to predict whether the stock will go up or down tonight an amd calls spread looks good grabbing the 55 95c for $139 and selling the 100c for $55 at the time of writing this this means you can get the spread for $84 this could offer 6x gains if amd goes up 11 keep in mind with earnings you can never predict things with certainty just for fun yesterday i made a comment saying that uber was going to go up 10 today with earnings and it did this post is not financial or investment advice consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it s time to make a last minute earnings prediction in fact just because i m posting it amd might crash just for fun
progressive pgr bear analysis i remembered seeing this post from a month ago about how progressive is overvalued and has avoided the recession to this point and surprisingly progressive has only stayed up since then wsb has been wrong before but what has shocked me most about progressive is their 5 year chart 1 year chart with lack of financial growth in the past year and a wild pe ratio of 88 i think pgr is due for a much needed correction in the near future positions 1118 $125 puts

car repossessions are surging a troubling sign for the used car market there s a troubling situation spreading among car owners that could portend an implosion of the used car industry according to a new report repossessions of vehicles are surging and have even doubled among socalled prime borrowers or people with good to excellent credit scores who are considered the least likely to default on their lows lisa beilfuss popeo a senior writer for barron s told cbs news repossessions occur when a borrower falls behind on their car payments giving the lender the right to seize the vehicle the rise in repossessions comes after car prices surged during the pandemic as auto manufacturers struggled to meet demand amid chip shortages and other issues used car prices rose particularly sharply with the average used car price jumping almost17 in mayto more than $32 000 you have used car prices skyrocketing and people having to borrow more and more to get their hands on a car beilfuss popeo said used car market bubble americans had temporary pockets of income during the pandemic thanks to stimulus checks extra unemployment aid and child tax credit payments allowing them to pay up for pricier cars she added that s caused concerns among experts that the used car market is in a bubble beilfuss popeo noted but those government supports have ended and many families are now facing budget shortfalls given thehighest inflation in 40 years as a result more consumers are defaulting on their auto loans with subprime repossessions up 11 since 2020 accordingto the autonews site jalopnik and repossessions among prime borrowers has doubled from 2 to 4 during the past two years beilfuss popeo said one red flag is the rate of repossession for prime borrowers is starting to rise it s not just subprime borrowers that are having problems she noted but there is a bright spot said popeo who believes the rapid rise in interest rates as a result of aggressive fed hikes should cool the market as intended demand is cooling it should lower prices for certain things like cars
etf and market evaluation for week of 06052023 recap on last weeks market action spy closed up 145 qqq closed up 075 dow jones industrial closed up 212 vix closed down 659 for some reason images were not allowed to be posted can be access through my website but not necessary good evening everyone i hope this past weekend has allowed you to relax and prepare for the upcoming week although this was only a 4 day week we still saw nice upward moves across the market we are also beginning to see broader participation in the market rally the only major schedule announcements for this week are jobless claims coming out thursday morning spy continued pushing above a long base and closed strongly on friday even though this was a shorter week volume on the weekly chart was only marginally below average spy also had larger weekly price gains than qqq this could be signalling that the market rally is finally broader and spreading to other industries and sectors price is approaching august 2022 highs which may act as an area of resistance qqq has been much stronger than spy over the past few weeks this is largely due to a select few mega cap stocks making huge advances qqq is somewhat extended and it would not be surprising to see a pause soon sideways action here would be constructive as it would give underlying stocks the chance to form new bases with that in mind there are still plenty of etfs that have broken out of bases as well as those that are currently approaching base breakouts arkg is an etf that focuses on genomics companies and has a trigger price of $3370 there are two things that catch my eye when examining this chart first in the last few weeks there is more heavy buying volume than selling volume second there is a large tail bar that got rejected at the trigger price therefore if price begins to breakout it must be associated with heavy buying volume to get past the sellers at that price if price is advancing on only average volume this would be a risky purchase clou is a cloud computing etf that is approaching a long downward trendline that began forming in august 2022 this is not the cleanest chart as it is clear that there is alot of variability in price a push above fridays buys could be an entry point however a safer entry would pushing above $1950 with heavy buying volume ffty is an etf that tracks 50 stocks that match ibds growth selection criteria friday saw a large pop in price that put ffty within striking distance of a base breakout this base breakout could be met with extra resistance as the base roughly coincides with the 200 day ema white ijh is an etf that tracks midcap stocks ijh is fastly approaching the trigger price of $25160 as a result of fridays price gains we saw a sharp decline in price that coincided with several bank collapses however price found support and has been trading sideways since tna is very similar to ijh except it tracks smallcap stocks instead of midcaps the price action is just below the trigger price of $3300 however tna is sitting below the 200 day ema white which may lead to some resistance while there are only a handful of etfs that i found to be approaching base breakouts there are many more that are currently beyond their price bases this is a positive sign as is shows stocks that broke out are working and new setups are still forming the most encouraging etfs on this list are the midcaps and smallcaps these demonstrate that there is finally a broader participation in the market rally this is what is truly needed for the market to actually advance the best way to capitalize on these bases is to look at the top ten holdings in each and exam the chart setups as always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment if you have any comments or question on what is discussed in the article or otherwise please feel free to reach out

bought puts a couple days ago on tesla lots to be desired in earnings reports a healthy dose of fear looms over the market even a moderately low revenue miss could shake up a stocks price tesla was overvalued i mean it sells less cars then gm and ford by a lot but has a market cap of 301 comparable to other car companies as other companies get in on the electric car boom tesla will have more competition then in the past some electric cars coming out of germany could rival tesla slowing demand higher rates and supply chain issues cloud tesla

dd $afrm calls this week $afrm is setting up for a reversal to the upside in the weekly chart it s currently at $1701 if $afrm can break and hold the $1745 level i expect the stock to go to $2160 a 24 move to the upside now before some of you start talking bs in the comments i get sensitive sometimes ok here are some of my recent trades $f entered oct 25 at $1269 currently at $1451 a 1442 move in my direction after 3 weeks $dkng went long on oct 25 at $1391 sold nov 1 for $1634 for 1747 profit in 7 days $rblx last week i posted this trade to this sub check my profile also some of you told me you made money which is pretty cool honestly if you want to see more evidence of my past trades you can pm me and i ll send it to you now that we got that out of the way let s talk about $afrm here s $afrm s weekly chart it has a beautiful hammer candle 80 of the time this means that it s going back up to the previous candle s high $afrm took a beating on earnings though which is not good but $afrm is also a shit stock that makes no sense the market is on its way up right now within the next 2 weeks we re going to see $spy hit $411 and $qqq $311 so a 7 move to the upside on $qqq and around 3 for spy $afrm will move with the rest of the stocks but $afrm is a stock with a lot of volatility so the move will be of higher magnitude that s my thesis entry don t be stupid and enter the trade on monday when the market opens $afrm has a resistance level on $1745 if $afrm does not break that resistance level you should not enter the trade as you can see in the chart this level was previously support now it s resistance i like to use the hourly chart if $afrm breaks that resistance level and confirms on the hourly chart i m going in confirms means that you wait for an hourly candle to close above the resistance level if you want to know whenif i enter the trade you can pm me x200b x200b

historic inflation dd long time listener first time caller all the discussion on here has been very interesting so thank you for that i love numbers and i m good with excel so i got curious about historical periods of high inflation which i am defining as over 8 i created a table that crossreferences monthly inflation with a 20day average of the djia spanning the first of every month there have been 6 prior periods going back to 1914 where inflation has held above 8 the longest was in 1916 at 49 months the shortest in 1951 at 5 months and the average is 26 months we are presently at 2 going on 3 months on 713 i next looked for the highest index value in the 12 months preceding 8 inflation and the lowest index value in the period after crossing 8 threshold capped at 12 months following inflation dropping back below 8 the time period from peak to trough as outlined was shortest in 1951 at 3 months longest at 23 months and averages 15 months we are presently at 6 months i also computed the returns over the peak to trough period which were highest in 1951 at 5 lowest in 1973 at 41 and averaged 20 we are presently at 14 the attached shows the data time normalized on the first month where inflation rises above 8 0 row with the preceding highs and following lows flagged i chose to adjust occurrences 1 and 6 to the earlier flag to compute the above metrics i have a long history of being retarded and i m literally a gay bear thanks for reading x200b
guys we must short china i m telling you guys in the next few weeks china is going to have an economic meltdown 100x worse than the 2008 financial crisis china s largest companies are financial institutions and property developers and all of them are tied in a cycle of speculation fraud and risky lending practices they ve built a house of cards on top of jelly and an earthquake is about to hit at first i thought the chinese government would bail them out but honestly this problem is too big for even them to fix and good luck getting bailed out by other countries because everyone hates the ccp important though i am not a stock expert i m an idiot who loves politics and economics and i can clearly see this economic disaster waiting to happen property developers banks financial institutions short them all and maybe pull your money out of the stock market in september because this economic crisis will fuck up the rest of the world too
iron butterflies aka buying a similarly priced long call and long put on a stock expiring at the same date saw it on rh is this a viable way to capitalize on high market volatility obviously the basics apply everywhere research diversify etc but really as long as you re not going in too deep you re very likely to keep making your money back at the very least right it s been working out for me so far so i was thinking about doing more contracts on my next one just wanted to hear from some people who are maybe employing similar strats with higher stakes

how is growing income inequality and rapid cost of living increases sustainable in an economy that depends of societal wide consumerism like i m sorry if i sound like a conspiracy theorist but none of this adds up to me the only reason why rich elites are rich in america is because they gain their wealth off of selling goods and services to the american consumerism if cost of living and income inequality keep rising to the point people can only afford to work and eat they stop having kids and buying shit how are the rich owners of walmart taco bell and all those other companies supposed to sustain themselves like won t it just grind to a halt you can t have an economy where 1 own everything 8 are highly paid software engineers and everyone else is a wage slave something has to give right what is that breaking point

us factory sector continues contraction for eighth straight month raising concerns of impending recession the latest report on the us factory sector reveals a persistent slowdown throughout june as the overall index remained in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month among the details only four out of eighteen industries experienced growth during this period the economy is now below its prepandemic high leaving little room to deny the evident slowdown our analysis leads us to maintain our belief that a recession is looming with today s report emphasizing that the goods sector of the economy is likely to be the leading contributor respondents of the survey in june expressed concerns about the deceleration of the us economy and more importantly anticipated reduced demand from customers new orders index also remained in contraction territory for the tenth month in a row similarly the production index fell back into contraction territory in june consumers have been shifting their preferences away from goods and toward services further exacerbating the situation the combination of decreased consumer demand and accumulated inventories at retailers indicates that factory output is likely to remain sluggish there is some positive news as factories have managed to catch up on order backlogs due to fewer new orders and improvements in supply chains however the backlogs index although showing a slight increase in june remains near the lowest readings since the 2008 financial crisis unfortunately the slowdown in orders and the reduction in backlogs have started to impact employment as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction at 481 in june on the inflation front the prices index witnessed a decline to 418 in june marking the second consecutive decrease after a recent upward trend in conclusion the latest report on the us factory sector presents a worrisome picture of a persistent slowdown and contraction in june with the overall index remaining in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month and only a few industries showing growth it becomes increasingly difficult to deny the evident slowdown this analysis strongly supports the belief that a recession may be on the horizon with the goods sector likely to be the primary contributor respondents concerns about the deceleration of the us economy and anticipated reduced customer demand further emphasize this outlook order backlogs which have slightly improved due to fewer new orders and supply chain enhancements they remain near their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis regrettably the impact on employment is becoming apparent as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction furthermore the decline in the prices index suggests a possible easing of inflationary pressures taken together these findings paint a challenging landscape for the us economy the accumulation of inventories and reduced consumer demand are likely to keep output sluggish in the coming months vigilance and proactive measures will be essential to navigate these economic headwinds and mitigate the potential impact on various sectors of the economy

probably going to go max margin short for cpi some thoughts through some introspection and recognition of my inability to stop myself from yoloing which is why i have found myself back here even though i said i would take a break i will concede that some of you may have been right about me potentially having a gambling addiction i looked through some gambling addiction symptoms and let s just say i recognized one or two of them in myself maybe a little more i am probably going to have to put some safeguards up sooner or later to protect myself from myself i recognize i already won the game at this point and i m fking over myself and my family with my actions yoloing max margin shortlong in concentrated positions is not normal behavior but i m having trouble from stopping myself i don t think that me posting yolos on wsb helps either we underestimate tail risks even if you know that you underestimate tail risks and we underestimate how losses and wins can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolioending decisions fk i really don t want to screw up anyways back to the point i am going to likely go max margin short for cpi on thursday everyone and their dog is thinking we get a cool cpi print we might but i think the upside is limited even if we do fed members speaking that day will likely talk the markets down if we rip cooler cpi print seems like it s already priced in market is poorly hedged for the downside but if we get a hot cpi we might get a rerun of what happened during the september cpi print it wasn t pretty basically imo the r r is skewed towards the downside and i cannot say no to shorting that the bear market rally already happened and it s behind us imo imo cpi hot higher rates for longer stocks down cpi low likely indicates demand destruction bearish for earnings stocks down maybe up in the immediate term maybe not might be a sellthenews event i already have a large short position using quite a bit of leverage so i will need to sell my only remaining long position asts to initiate a bigger short position they are expected to fully validate the technology by t6 months from launch and that gives us a midmarch date i really do not want to miss out on the potentially explosive upside eg if they announce the test results were successful earlier than i imagined so i will keep a core position probably somewhere between 1020k shares i will be selling the rest tomorrow in hopes of playing the short side of the market and in hopes of entering long again in asts in the future hopefully i can get the timing down i will hopefully post what i short end up shorting tomorrow this is also contingent on us being the same price level or higher when i get the chance to sell asts and initiate more shorts some of the stocks on my short watchlists $crm $nflx $li $sq $dash $uber $cat $de $nvda a ton more none of this is financial advice and without notice and at any given moment i can open new positions and close any position that i may have i might also change my mind on how i view these companies and the broader market as always do your own dd and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing love you all and wish you all the best
credit suisse so what s up with credit suisse how are they still alive i was thinking about how massive and important it is to fail but if credit suisse is lying about having enough funds there is no way to save it literally every government is in a oh fuck fiat currency sucks moment only way governments have been able to get money recently is by ponzi scheming bonds and no country big enough has funds available to them to bail out a bank like the us can t figure it s shit out england is on a brink of failure china is being china and locking everyone down and getting rammed in the rear from their land investments so is credit suisse really in a good spot and have funds to stay afloat or has something happened to keep people away from attacking cs to prevent the collapse of the world i ask because i haven t seen anything on cs in awhile and it s stock continues to climb just seems odd it had lots of heat on it and now nobody is talking about it

$apd a technical breakout and potential options play hi everyone i have recently been following a company called air products and chemicals inc apd because of a very nice technical setup that i have seen evolve i know this isn t your typical tsla yolo that you might find on wsb but this could still make you money nonetheless if played right a little background before i get into the ta apd is a company which sells gases in fact they are one of the largest producers of hydrogen gas which makes them poised to be a big player when the hydrogen economy starts taking off one thing that i found interesting is that there are actually big players out there taking steps to move towards hydrogen as we speak just the other day plug power got a contract with walmart to supply several them with several tons of hydrogen on a daily basis to power their warehouse equipment forklifts etc as a results i do see a big opportunity for companies such as apd when it comes to the ta i first watched a break of the resistance seen in the above chart after the breakout however resistance was formed at the 382 retracement the stock has held strong and formed what looks to be a handle to a cup and handle formation a bullish pattern seen in stocks in addition the macd looks to be cycling back to bullish territory soon and the rsi has room to run on this timeframe on the one hour chart i saw yet another bullish pattern forming this time an inverse head and shoulders here you can see the stock is well on its way to forming the last shoulder of the pattern following a strong finish to yesterday even as the general market was dropping completion of this patter could propel the stock past the resistance of 253 which lays at the 382 retracement level previously mentioned with a breakout there are several gaps that the stock may reach which could again propel the price to higher levels i am playing this with 520 250cs i wish everyone the best in their trades

$iova fda approval on flagship drug imminent name of the company iovance iova is a biopharmaceutical company from the east coast with impending fda approval on its flagship drug for treating advanced melanoma the flagship drug lifileucel is currently in the process of fda approval which is expected before feb 24th lifileucel has had a rocky time over the past few years initially iovance aimed to file for approval in 20202021 this process has been very much delayed much like me saying i would move out my parents house in 2020 it is 2024 and the final deadline is only now approaching the approval was expected in late 2023 however the fda pushed back approval until feb 2024 due to resource issues which is why this post exists the body has immune cells known as tumourinfiltrating lymphocytes tils which are capable of killing cancer cells they occur completely naturally what iovance effectively do is take a sample of a person s tumour then multiply the number of these cancer killing cells then put them back into the patient s body as a personalised cancer killing drug whilst this personalisation has shown evidence of being highly effective one of the downsides is the manufacturing process to quote one expert from a nature paper from a biotechnology perspective everything about manufacturing tils is difficult translating scientists can be a difficult as they are afflicted by similar neurodiversity as witnessed in the daily discussion therefore i will do so for you developing these types of treatments is fucking dogshit and we only do it because it works iovance have refined the manufacturing process in particular since it is something which is personalised several times in order to pass fda approval this is the big risk on this play if the fda reject the drug it will be incredibly difficult to come back from this stock will get fucked if this fails as with any mid cap biopharm company although i think the chances of this are quite low given the advanced steps we re seeing being taken by the company as any wellversed investor in pharmaceuticals i went straight to linkedin page seeing a number of job offerings in the manufacturing sector posted in the past few weeks this to me is a highly bullish sentiment and the strongest indicator for this stock this would mark the first approval of cell therapy for solid tumours similar processes exist for blood cancers which have shown to be effective and profitable furthermore lifileucel does not require any genetic modification unlike those for blood cancers the company are also conducting trials to allow this as a first use drug allowing for treatment in less advanced cancers additionally iovance are aiming to submit lifileucel for approval in both the eu and uk in the upcoming months iovance also have a drug in clinical trials for lung cancer which is highly promising ln145 this clinical trial was halted because someone died although these patients were incredibly vulnerable and since similar problems have not been seen in ln144 lifileucel approval of lifileucel will only boost sentiment in this treatment amplifying gains i ll leave you a quote from the annual report showing they think this is getting approved the current cash position and anticipated revenue in 2024 from lifileucel and proleukin the only existing product they have is expected to be sufficient to fund current and planned operations into 2025 unfortunately the iv is higher than most people reading this right now so this is going to be a share only play from myself i know 9 dollars seems high for something that has burned so many but i m still bullish i have no pharma experience my top holding is boeing please take this information carefully no position until tuesday
twilio is a tale of two directions like the great ai philosophical question is twilio a tool or a destination i am interested in opinions on twilio s stock from the wsb community given the last earnings report in which earnings and revenue beats came in handily it is interesting that there was such a large decline in the stock price in large part i think due to the looming decision on what to do with the segment business and the uncertainty of whether twilio can leverage ai for its offerings in a meaningful way there were a number of meaningful data points to unpack but i found it interesting that they moved $54m in revenue previously attributed to the segment line of business previously data and applications to the communications side this seems to imply sale of the unit positioning while retaining assets that may be accretive to the overall communications core business that can be leveraged more effectively in the future other semi positive data points that i consider meaningful segment is strategically important mentioned several times by the ceo seems contradictory to a decision to reallocate a portion of the segment revenue what s the point if the unit will continue as part of twilio the impact of crypto volume on the business this seems to have good long term tailwinds for twilio although a short term drag not sure the long term impact is considered fully cash and cash equivalents of $4b $1b in debt implies 30 of the market value of the business roughly based on current valuation improving earnings picture and revenue and nongaap earnings better than consensus consitently share buyback in progress and cash incentive plan to reduce share price dilution moving forward stock based compensation declining as a percentage of revenue from prior quarters continues to be a visionary leader and has a leadership position in its space significant high value customer wins although not much detail provided there was allusions to the impact of the ai features tipping the scale improving gross margins except in segment a target for acquisition usually this is good for stock pricebut perhaps the valuation price is unclear for them negative data points include management stock incentive plans still meaningfully dilutive for the short to medium term macro interest rate environment reducing valuation of growth tech revenue growth 10 annually which is not a high growth tech trajectory more competition in space fragmented offerings that promise use of ai to customers yet may not be sufficiently differentiable macro headwind on small cap tech with money all flowing into largest tech titans i see this as analogous to shift in consumer markets from small business to big business mom and pop shifting to big boxthis is now happening in the market which is unusual in my mind and it is not all clear to me at least what the implications are with that so what are your thoughts for twilio based on the above and your own dd what are your other thoughts based on the above is twilio a tool that will be supplanted by something better or will it become a destination again for investors thanks for your opinions

newron is karunas biggest rival newron pharmaceuticals evenamide is also moving more into focus with articles like this the next study data will be coming soon at less than 100 million mk is 70 times less than karuna the us regulator has set an action date of 26th september next year for a decision on karxt which combines muscarinic agonist xanomeline tartrate and muscarinic antagonist trospium chloride as a treatment for adults with schizophrenia a condition that affects around 39 million people in the us and 24 million worldwide for around 70 years the treatment of schizophrenia has relied almost entirely on drugs that block dopamine d2 receptors but karxt is one of a clutch of new therapies emerging from the pharma industry pipeline that works in a different way along with rivals like newron pharma s evenamide and sumitomootsuka s ulotaront karuna s drug is thought to exert its antipsychotic effects through muscarinic m1 and m4 receptors in the central nervous system targeted by xanomeline while trospium prevents side effects by blocking the drug s effects on the peripheral nervous system karuna maintains that the drug could help tackle symptoms of the disorder without causing side effects common with older drugs like olanzapine and risperidone such as weight gain movement disorders tardive dyskinesia and sedation a recent draft review by the influential institute for clinical and economic review icer in the us concluded that in clinical trials it had been shown to improve the proportion of hospitalised schizophrenia patients showing a 30 or greater improvement in symptoms compared to placebo over five weeks without the weight gain that is a problem with current antipsychotic medications a lack of data after five weeks is a concern according to the review which says the drug appears to be promising but with an inconclusive net health benefit compared to older drugs karuna is currently conducting two phase 3 studies looking at the longterm safety and efficacy of the drug globaldata has predicted that karxt will launch in the us next year and achieve sales of $11 billion by 2031 thanks to its safety profile and ability to broadly target symptoms of schizophrenia ie both positive delusions and hallucination symptoms and negative social withdrawal and apathy looking at its rivals ulotaront an agonist of 5ht receptor 1a and trace amineassociated 1 taar1 receptors stumbled in phase 3 failing to meet the primary endpoints in the diamond 1 and 2 trials reported earlier this year that makes karxt s closest rival evenamide which modulates glutamate and blocks voltagegated sodium channels and is currently in latestage testing for patients with treatmentresistant schizophrenia as an addon to current therapies and as a monotherapy for those who don t respond to current drugs
astrazeneca looks bullish technical analysis hello everyone a few days ago i posted my views on gme but it apparently got deleted i don t know why whatever be it i m back with another technical analysis of mine would love to hear what you guys have to say about it x200b script name astrazeneca plc tick azn view bullish x200b weekly timeframe view 1 astrazeneca had a breakout with increasing volumes recently and subsequently it hit a new alltime high 2 after hitting the alltime high azn fell for 2 weeks straight and this week it has taken support from the previous resistance levels thus confirming that the resistance has now become a support zone the volume confirmation solidifies this view azn on weekly timeframe daily timeframe view 1 if we slap in a fibonacci from the last low to the recent high we can see that the price has taken support from 382 levels 2 not only that but we can also see that the 382 level coincides with the 50ema not to be mentioned that it also coincides with the weekly timeframe support zone 3 it is safe to say that if the market remains bullish azn can surely hit a new alltime high very soon azn on daily timeframe points to be noted 1 it might seem that my technical analysis on azn is a bit late since in the last trading session it already had a good bullish movement but what i believe is that yesterday s movement might give a little pullback since it might have been due to the results disclaimers 1 please perform your own analysis before taking any positions 2 please let me know if i m violating any sub rules by posting such analysis asked since my last analysis got deleted tldr i m bullish on astrazeneca x200b thank you happy trading x200b edit 1 entered at the opening today since it was a gap down

are we really heading towards recession what visible telling signs says so i travelled coast to coast in past three weeks i saw that the hotels flights are all booked airports are crowded in la atlanta outside dc and this weekend in nj saw all malls are full parking store registers food courts restaurants people looked oblivious to high gas prices or inflation didn t see any stressed out faces like last great recession moreover discretionary spending shops looked all doing well so what exactly is the telling sign that we are really heading for the recession other than that the market index has adjusted by 1015 and fiat coins have gone down from aths if at all we heading for recession it s still a long long way down the road seems lot of steam still in engine to cause any significant dent to demand what signs will definitely signal the arrival of recession edit i think even those in know also feel like even if recession is coming or is already here it s not going to affect me maybe it s for others
the fed will pivot before the election congress has responsibilities in the inflation fight too have a feeling the fed will pivot in their november meeting right before the election i believe this directive will come from the white house as they need the market to look better even if its temporary should see the market bounce big time they ll say something along the lines of we need to give the rate hikes time to work their way through they system and there is global risks to continuing raising rates at this level also that the elected officials have a responsibility in the inflation fight this isn t a job just for the federal reserve

i m all in this stock will 125x if trump wins the election with limited downside fnma earns $22byear in income but the market cap is currently at $08b the reason is the us treasury dept arbitrarily changed a contract from letting shareholders keep 20 of the company to 0 in 2012 trump wrote a letter this past november 2021 stating that this is theft and he will undo this if he gets reelected letter is here the president controls treasury so he will have full authority to reinstate the original contract terms before they were violated by the gov if he gets elected these shares will move from $08b market cap closer to their $100b fair market value 20 of $500b total market cap including the treasury dept s 80 stake that is a 125x move in just 2 years and obviously if something has a 5050 ish chance of 125x ing in 2 years it will 10x immediately once the market becomes aware of it so here is a free immediate 10x and a 5050 shot at a 125x in 2 years all of that upside exists because these shares have long been forgotten and everyone assumes that the us treasury owns 100 if trump loses it s unlikely the shares go much lower because it s already largely priced in that treasury owns it but it will continue to get litigated and therefore retain its longterm option value so the downside is somewhat protected here too i can no longer wagecuck so i am all in position below none of this is financial advice edit after seeing initial comments if you ever wanted to fade wsb for a 125x here s your chance everyone s dismissing this in the comments so far
the dd on monkeypox and how you can profit off it the bull case for siga technologies and bavarian nordic a lot of folks here on wsb and other places have been making light of the global monkeypox outbreak but as the months have gone by it has gotten progressively worse those who scoff at monkeypox could in fact be scoffing at a quick ticket to a lambo and a yacht the disease is rapidly spreading to new countries and in places like new york city demand for vaccine is so high that clinics typically run out within minutes of announcing availability the global epidemic has gotten bad enough that theworld health organization is meeting today to decide whether or not to declare monkeypox a global heath emergency as with any crisis disaster or pandemic there are those who stand to profit from the chaos so the natural question us here at wsb will ask is just how can i make money of monkeypox the answer lies with bavarian nordic that makes monkeypox vaccine and siga therapeutics that makes the only effective antiviral treatment for monkeypox so just what is monkeypox monkeypox is in the orthopoxvirus family and is closely related to smallpox cowpox horsepox camelpox and vaccina virus monkeypox like all orthodox viruses spreads through close contact with infected persons and the pustules that form on the skin of those infected was the deadliest of the orthopox viruses it had two subtypes 1 variola major the most common type had a deathrate of 30 and 2 variola minor which had a deathrate of about 1 similarly monkeypox also has two variants the congo basin variant has a death rate of about 10 and the west african variant has a death rate of about 1 the west african variant is the type that has now spread across the globe and infecting people worldwide while outside of a minor outbreak in the us midwest important for reasons we will get into in 2003 and some isolated cases monkeypox was not known to spread outside of africa until the current outbreak however it is entirely possible that some cases of monkeypox many decades ago had been mistaken for weak variola minor cases most of the other orthopox virus are much milder than smallpox or monkeypox but all cases of orthopox can be disfiguring leaving scars hence the pox leaving literal pock marks on the skin after infection monkey pox is spread through contact with an infected person or through contact with infected rodents the 2003 outbreak was spread through contact with pet gambian pouched rats very different from today s epidemic which is spread through close person to person contact given that animals can spread the disease even in the event it is eventually suppressed in humans in a particular area if a local animal population becomes infected that could provide a new reservoir for the disease monkeypox is already endemic in large swaths of africa its stands to reason that even if the current epidemic subsides that additional monkeypox outbreaks will occur in the future globally without widespread vaccination so how can i profit off of it as i mentioned above there are two primary pharmaceutical products that stand to profit from the expanding global monkeypox epidemic 1 siga technologies nasdaq siga amazingly even though monkeypox was not a widespread disease of global concern until recently there is in fact an antiviral drug on the market that is effective at treating monkeypox and other orthopox viruses this is siga technology s tpoxx antiviral drug its sales have soared as the monkeypox outbreak has worsened since it is practically the only effective treatment for monkeypox the result is that as monkeypox spreads to new areas countries have no choice but to place orders for more and more of siga s tpoxx drug with siga racking up tens of millions of dollars in orders tpoxx s applications actually go beyond monkeypox siga just signed a deal with kalivir immunotherapeutic to use tpoxx as part of a cancer treatment kalivir s cancer treatment uses vaccina virus to target and destroy cancer cells since tpoxx appears to work against all orthopox viruses including vaccina virus its use can moderate the effects of the vaccina virus injections given with the cancer treatments siga s tpoxx drug was also designed to be effective against smallpox and countries were originally interested in it to protect against any bioweapon attacks using smallpox in fact siga s development of tpoxx was subsidized by the government specifically for use in the instance of biological warfare involving smallpox a benefit to this is that siga has lower rd costs associated with tpoxx due to the subsidies and therefore reaps in higher profits on each new order siga technologies is actively traded on the nasdaq under ticker symbol siga and yes there are options available since tpoxx is the only treatment if the monkeypox outbreak continues to get worse siga will reap in the profits of couse if the outbreak subsides the demand for siga s drug will slacken but the opportunity for its uses outside of treating monkeypox such as in kalivir s cancer treatment will potentially still be there siga reports its quarterly earnings in early august 2 bavarian nordic nasdaq copenhagen bava in addition to tpoxx there are also vaccines that have been approved by the fda and the eu that are effective against monkeypox however bavarian nordic s jynneos vaccine is by far the most popular and useful on the market for reasons that we will get into similar to how tpoxx is seemingly effective against multiple orthopox viruses most smallpox vaccines are also effective against multiple other orthopox viruses generally infection with one type of orthopox virus provides protection against the others the first vaccine ever created was simply cowpox virus also an orthopox virus deliberately given to people in the late 1700 s to protect them against smallpox since the deathrate for cowpox is very low people would survive the cowpox and be protected against smallpox most modern smallpox vaccines use vaccina virus which has a death rate that is infinitesimally small mostly just severely immunocompromised people however vaccina virus does have side effects since it is a live virus most notably it causes a scar at the injection site but it can occasionally cause mild illness in otherwise people smallpox vaccination purposes this is perfectly acceptable because of the absurdly high deathrate and disfigurement smallpox caused however this also meant that the smallpox vaccines that had been on the market could not be used for immunocompromised people as a result the company bavarian nordic bava on the nasdaq copenhagen obtained government subsidies to develop its jynneos vaccine which is made from a severely weakened nonreplicating attenuated version of the vaccina virus again the government s interest in aiding the development of jynneos was spurred by concerns of a bioattack with smallpox interestingly enough before the monkeypox outbreak even occurred jynneos was specifically also approved for use to prevent monkeypox while other smallpox vaccines are not even though they are also generally effective at preventing same since jynneos s vaccine does not have the nasty side effects that traditional smallpox vaccines do is specifically approved to prevent monkeypox and is safe for immunocompromised people bavarian nordic has been receiving millions and millions of orders from across the world for is jynneos vaccine on july 1 2022 the us federal government ordered an additional 25 million more vaccine doses from bavarian nordic the orders clinics offering the vaccine are routinely running out of vaccine doses most notably in new york city where the virus is spreading rapidly bavarian nordic reports is earnings on august 24 so what about the future outlook the more monkeypox spreads the better business will get for both siga and bavarian nordic once smallpox was eradicated in 1979 countries generally stopped vaccinating their citizens for smallpox the result is that most of the population today is unvaccinated against smallpox and therefore susceptible to all orthopox viruses including monkeypox in the us the only people who had been vaccinated the past few decades had been soldiers participating in the invasions of iraq where it was feared saddam hussein would use smallpox as a weapon certain researchers and medical personnel since most of the population is unvaccinated against monkeypox in the event monkeypox becomes permanently established aka endemic within the population of any particular country that country will have to start routinely ordering jynneos vaccine and tpoxx to prevent and treat the infections in the event countries want to vaccinate their entire population and attempt to wipe out monkeypox like they did smallpox literally billions of doses of jynneos vaccine will need to be ordered to vaccine most of the earth the result of course is utterly insane profits for royal bavarian and siga even in the event the current epidemic is ended the prospect of another international monkeypox outbreak will always be present and therefore countries will continue to order and keep on hand does of bavarian nordic s vaccine amazingly enough even though bavarian nordic keeps racking up orders from across the globe it is still currently trading at 20 less than its 52 week high of 369 dkk in august of last year i am long both bavarian nordic i own 670 adr shares and siga i own 151 shares and a variety of august 19 and september 16 to

lumn is it really worth only $4 a share after cutting the dividend trying to move towards growth lumn has fallen out of favor with the market i don t see them killing in it in the future or anything but as someone who works in the industry i think their focus in enterprise sales instead of legacy voice consumer broadband which has a ton of government red tape around it will be successful in the long term what do you guys think is lumn really worth only $4 a share and given the possibly irrational negative industry sentiment what are the chances we could see a short squeeze here not really sure which metrics would indicate that was a possibility

regional banks face uncertainty will the fed s projected rate hikes spell trouble jpow s move to play it cool with interest rates for now but also teasing rate hikes later in the year could spell some serious trouble for the banking scene it s not all roses and rainbows there are some potential pitfalls to look out for what are some good stocks to target 1 loan demand higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive as a result the demand for loans particularly for things like mortgages or business expansion could decrease this could limit the growth of the bank s lending portfolio 2 increased default risk with the higher cost of borrowing the risk of default could potentially increase which could impact the bank s credit risk 3 market volatility the stock market reaction to rate hikes can be negative as higher interest rates can make bonds more attractive relative to stocks leading to volatility in the financial markets this can affect banks that have significant holdings in marketbased securities or depend on a robust stock market for their wealth management businesses

understanding options iv crush so yesterday twtr call options crashed after the acquisition announcement and i am here for some reasoning so say before the acquisition announcement the stock has a 60 chance to go up to 52 if the deal is agreed upon and a 40 chance to go to 45 if the deal failed an option with $50 strike would have an expected value of $12 without considering ttm american style option rules interest rate after the announcement the option may have an 80 chance to go up to $52 and 20 to go to $49 so the expected value of the option would be $16 however that s obviously how the option was traded after the announcement the stock went up but the $50 call went down of course there s something called uncertainty and iv crush etc but the above probability assumption would obviously yield different result can you explain a bit edit also i though it probably relates to put call parity is that the case

inflation announcement my prediction back a couple months ago i made a post about how inflation is a lot higher than reporting and that inflation reporting is time delayed well today is that day those predictions start to come true and it s only the start unless the fed goes hard and fast on taming it which will have other repercussions inflation will exceed expectations possibly coming to 9 annually then the 10 yr treasury yield will punch through the resistance level of 28 and then we will be in a new territory that we haven t been in for 30 years the fed action will determine continued inflation stagflation or deflation enjoy

$gct shitty dd squeeze cuming so this is one i was watching on ipo day and i m sure we all seen it fly sky high following that it has since came down significantly to the point where i started my buying in yesterday and today i ve been sitting on my original gme gains for a while to find the right stock to yolo into i ve sold off my boomer stocks to accomplish my goals as of this post she s sitting at $2652 so here s the deal insiders own 4854 of the share count with institutional shares sitting at only 198 floats at 324 the insiders can t start shitting on us until after the 180 day lock up period giving them incentive to put out some type of good news in the near future gross profit margin is at 198 with a 2021 revenue of $4142m with a gross profit of $896m with revenue up from $2755m in 2020 it s a growing business 77m volume today where it leveled off on a big down day makes me feel like it s not going lower and the riskreward would be great after already pulling back substantially and the hype just starting on this one and idk about y all i like buying stocks while they re down although i get it $bbby to the moon it s a chinese stock and i know lots of people don t like playing those but money is money to me and this certainly isn t a long term hold for me but if there is a possibility of the next big jump like hkd i ve got to believe this is it in price discovery mode which is why we buy low and i m sure the hedgies have shorted the fuuuck out of it already hence the massive trading volume 1 such low float 2 insider lockup for 180 days preventing them from fuckin our watermelon 3 jdcum owns a large chunk of it 4 international business with offices everywhere including us 5 started in 2006 and they re sustainable and profitable 6 i ll post a video of me aggressively fuckin a watermelon if it hits $2500 like hkd did what do you got to lose but money trust me bro lmao my position 50 shares at an average of $3228 will be adding many more in the coming days most likely havn t yolo d yet but it s coming just trying to become a millionaire not investment advice just posting my thoughts while i poop edit vote this up if you agree

the situation at twitter is dire update lmfao msm is desperately pumping their bags with bullshit headlines about deal talks in anticipation of elon rug pull peak clown energy this morning distractions ahead execution is our own hands tune out the noise not financial advice following up the twitter hindenburg series the markets look like they have been pricing in a 5050 riskreward of price to 30 or 60 the problem is these risk premiums don t have much insight into how bad the twtr situation really has gotten this video has some good graphics and breakdowns for smoothers about how bad the situation is with financials and the antitakeover provisions this guy is good but he doesn t know just how bad the situation really is i ve seen a lot of smooth brains say board members don t have shares yeah ok who do you think appointed the board members there are powerful interests behind this thing and i m not going to go into too much detail here per sub rules exactly how bad this situation is for the people who actually find value in controllingowning twitter act in the interests of the share holders again who do you think this is it s not you their bottom line is the furthest apart from yours you can check some recent sec filings on twtr if you re curious etc anyways the board is having a meeting today to discuss exactly how fucked they are and probably put more awful shit for shareholders in place like golden parachute incase they get shit canned somehow i m almost positive that they are not considering elon s offer they ve already rejected him also we don t even know if elon will actually go through with it he could reach out for a handshake and then comb his hair instead of following through he s under no obligation yet it is almost guaranteed not financial advice that the board will reject elon again and officially it may come in conjunction with is almost certainly going to be a terrible earnings on thursday so they get two pieces of bad news on one spike instead of compounding it there is still a slight chance of an alternative buyout from gates perhaps like elon on twitter has sort of been eluding to but why hasn t this happened already i ll tell you why it probably is because no one wants to throw that much capital at this dumpster heap yet but why it s simple if you bid now you have to compete with elon s bid fuck that i would wait until they are forced to reject it let the fud come in hard let the bad earnings hit hard let someone like carl icahn come in and put pressure on the dilution fears maybe even start activating the scorched earth poison pill and golden parachute enactments really drive the fucking price down hard then start a new bidding war between people like gates bezos etc try to buy twitter for potentially 12x nav or less twtr nav is 731b there currently 865m shares this is about $815 a share but it gets fucking better why scorched earth can provide 5b additionally at any time latest 10kpg90 see op top links poison pill can provide 200m more per enactment twitters float could double triple 10x or even fucking 100x etc share price could go down to sub dollar prices or even lower than a penny and then getting back to a dollar to stay listed via reverse splits then your 100 shares could be made 1 share by adding the shares the marketcap price is the same value of the company being near net asset value nav but the per share price will be astronomically low because of all of the new added shares potentially death spiral x200b pill x200b and earth x200b parachute x200b not financial advice june 20p x200b x200b short sale regsho exempt return on issuance x200b x200b there are at least 5 types also look up flipon and flipoff twitter s is multiple x200b 5b authorized 61 3x the normal latest 10kpg90 x200b make sure nothing grows back x200b x200b severance bonuses x200b x200b x200b $1 listing requirements

united airlines ual bearish earnings dd airport traffic data united airlines one of the big american carriers is reporting earnings tonight they are up about 10 since last week s delta airlines earnings which beat expectations to some extent the market is thus pricing in and expecting positive numbers the outlook provided during their last earning s call was relatively bullish with a further recovery expected in q1 2022 compared to q4 2021 capacity expected to be down 1618 compared to 2019 down 23 in q4 revenue expected to be down 2025 compared to 2019 down 25 in q4 basically united airlines is expecting further improvements this quarter compared to last getting closer to 2019 traffic levels however i have some doubts based on public traffic data from january and february 2022 most airports publish monthly passenger and cargo traffic data on their websites some of these are broken down exactly by airline though not all the united airlines hub airports are x200b hubgranular data available for united denver internationalyes houston intercontinentalyes los angeles laxyes newark airportyes approximated san francisco internationalyes approximated washington dullesno chicago o hareno guam airportno data available these are the passenger traffic numbers i was able to find for the 5 hubs that have precise numbers for united airlines x200b passenger numbers for united airlines flights i noticed that for these 5 airports that have granular numbers only denver showed an improvement compared to last quarter for example the houston passenger numbers in q4 2021 reached 864 of their levels in q4 2019 however in janfeb 2022 houston passenger numbers only reached 745 of their level in janfeb 2019 overall united traffic in these 5 airports reached 785 of its 2019 levels in januaryfebruary compared to q4 2021 when they had already reached 831 of the 2019 levels caveat march numbers aren t out yet for these statistics and it s possible that they were an improvement compared to the janfeb numbers they will also be included in tonight s earnings report the picture looks somewhat similar for chicago o hara and washington dulles i would take these numbers with a grain of salt since they are for total passenger traffic at these airports not united specifically if market shares of airlines have shifted over the years the numbers might be misleading but the overall picture is the same in q4 2021 numbers came pretty close to q4 2019 but in januaryfebruary 2022 they have actually gotten worse x200b note january numbers only for washington dulles i think this is a pretty good time for putsbear spreads on ual expectations are relatively high based on delta s numbers at the same time we ve seen a few other consumerfacing stocks get punished during earnings because demand decreased due to consumer concerns about inflation i will open a small bearish position tonight before close and post it here

bitcoin is going to the fucking moon hello dumb fucks i ve been watching bitcoin and the crypto sphere for quite some time now i really do believe bitcoin could see an exponential increase of value here soon here are my reasons being 1 bitcoin is theoretically the best hedge against inflation 2 current monetary assets are not backed by any real commodity 3 the theory behind bitcoin and the idea of scarcity will be key to keeping this monetary asset as a highly valuable item 4 as the internet grows and i believe it will grow even more within the next decade as we become more interdependent on the web and the innovation behind technology forcing us to keep up with current technological trends will force us to think about buying commodities that will allow us to have leverage in transactions over the internet 5 optimism is growing with the introduction of spot etfs and the 4 year halving this could realistically fuel a massive bull run as it creates a sense of panic for retail investors to start buying up bitcoin commodities to not feel left out 6 the classic hype surrounding scarcity as is the same idea with diamonds gold and birkins the price point is driven higher with low supply and high demands 7 bitcoin is becoming a more popular transaction method around the world now i know many of you have probably come to some if not all of these conclusions on your own but what do we make of the early bull run rotations and do we think it is feasible

$tsla be warned with $tsla earnings coming up and the recent rally i want to warn all you fellow cupandsniff investors who are planning to long tesla 1 yes there currently is a slight relief rally with the stock i m seeing a sudden barrage of tsla to 150 180 200 by next month comments that aren t satirical and are completely serious i invite you to open a simple stock chart and look at three months back $tsla is at a severe downtrend if earnings also disappoint do not be surprised to see sub $100 very soon 2 earnings are coming up and $tsla will likely disappoint we previewed a hint of it with deliveries missing largely this in addition to factory shutdowns and demand issues will absolutely harm earnings for the quarter as for the price cuts these price cuts were just recently introduced and will benefit the stock in the next quarter not q4 something that is constantly misinterpreted 3 elon musk is losing the trust of investors he is no longer the super cool space guy he is now regularly being commented on as deceiving his own investors and getting far too political further alienating himself and harming the brand as a ceo why does this matter he can be attributed to one of the primary reasons tsla exploded as a stock with such an unreasonably high value 4 with tightening margins and a greater scope of the company to the public eye it s becoming evident that tsla is simply a car brand with additional benefits such as battery technology the concept of the ev is becoming more common and tsla isn t the only one producing them eventually this will transfer towards the stock the company will still likely be great likely late 2023 and onward but certainly won t have the futuristic hype it had previously and certainly won t be valued like it used to i say this as a previous $tsla investor who sold his shares bought in 2019 midyear in 2022 i know many of you need helmets on your head when you re in public but please be cautious investing in $tsla in the short term tldr $tsla short term is fucked down the road potential good buy
debt ceiling passed and hidden legislature for a defense contract spending cap aliens i saw a dd on this thread yesterday rationalizing buying redacted due to the possibility they are in possession of alien spacecraft they intend on using this technology in the future blah blah blah i don t have schizophrenia and i don t have mania to drive my decision making all i have is logic brain so this is for those who rarely do any research deeper than their youtube conspiracy rabbit hole the debt ceiling bill has been passed not only that but if you did any sort of reading you d also realize that defense spending has been capped until 2025 national security spending in fiscal 2024 will be capped at $886 billion which would be a roughly 3 percent increase from current levels in fiscal year 2025 defense spending would be capped at $895 billion just a 1 percent increase from the previous year trust when i saw that this trend will continue if we have a democratic president andor a democratic majority in congress but people rarely think past next tuesday let alone consider what our country will look like in 2026 when new leaders of the free world emerge no unprecedented growth no hefty increases to the pentagon s budget just a fixed budget target where will that money go you might ask sure some of it will go towards providing support to ukraine through manufacturing tactical aircraft which is redacted largest seller i ll tell you right now it s not going towards alien spacecraft technology it s not going towards ground breaking innovation within the defense industry they are making bullets missiles and tin cans for these types of conflicts not some pipe dream alien hoverboard spacecraft that can take you back in time to when you peaked in high school then again what do i know people get lucky all the time

do you believe in nvidia in the long term so nvidia 7 today because morgan stanley thinks nvidia is their top pick rating overweight price target $500 $437 today i agree with morgan stanley that i don t see demand will drop anytime soon considering all the ai startups are booming and some of them are actually useful ie midjourney but i also feel that nvidia has gone up too much in 2023 for a trillion dollar company nvidia earnings are coming up on aug 23 what are your thoughts fyi the following are some of the quotes from morgan stanley s notes nvidia remains our top pick with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards ai and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters demand is high we expect nvda s data center business to drive much of the growth over the next 5 years as enthusiasm for generative ai has created a strong environment for aiml hardware solutionsnvda s being one of the most important incremental opportunities in aiml software services networking and adas can drive growth even higher last quarter s guidance for $4 bn in revenue upside was the largest single increase in one quarter in semiconductor historythe implied $75 bn in quarterly data center revenue is trending to $15 bn over the next few quarters which is our primary focus driving enthusiasm for the stock supply is low per our conversations and public data points less than half of the current demand is being met the exact revenue number in october is less important than the overall trajectory october shipments are clearly gated by supplya material amount of july quarter shipments came out of inventory guidance was conservative while supply is clearly the gating factor we believed that the initial guidance was very conservative to begin with we still expect a meaningful beat and raise quarterand more importantly strong visibility over the next 34 quarters

twtr question so let s say twatter rejects the $5420 deal and doesn t counteroffer in that case how does elon get out of this at a profit if the announcement of the deal not going through share price drops back to the mid 30 s and elon is bagholding 92 the only way i see him exiting at a profit is to keep the hype going and rugpull all the musktards for a 300m profit but what are the sec rules for selling that much stock is he allowed to just dump his shit like that keeping in mind he s not majority shareholder anymore
blackberry earnings iot 1given that more ev s built in china than north america the qnx royalties from these firms will ramp up 2 according to mattias eriksson 7075 million new vehicles in 2022 which is increasing to prepandemic which was 90 million 3 the iot profitability is 82 and the revenue for the last three quarters has been $50 million thus if the ramp up is in effect for new vehicles yoy revenue is growing at 20 and head count is also growing if design wins these first two quarters was more than in last fiscal year and qnx backlog is $560 million a conservative number would be that this quarter $56 60 million cyber and licensing 4 cybersecurity had revenue of $111 last quarter but if you remember cylance was being bundled with other products and channel partners were acquired in asia free try of cylance was marketed for 6 months to replace legacy products in midsize companies and now the revenue from that should flow this quarter note that john giamatteo who is heading this is from mcafee cylance founder was from mcafee thus a beat on cyber is a possibility 5 either a patent sale in progress or revenue recoup for ip licensing is in effect so that either news will mean $$$ therefore a beat on revenue is likely
it s all about allocation choices allocation choices are what move stocks big money enters markets stocks bonds every year during the covid crash the fed made people prefer the riskiest stocks by putting a floor under junk bonds this time they haven t so where does the money go stocks of free cash flow per share growers right now berkshire hathaway trades at a 75 evffcf yield that s for a company that had positive free cash flow during the covid19 shutdown quarter so it s safe to say it is at least as safe as junk bonds plus it grows its free cash flow over time after you buy it most of its holdings benefit from inflation junk bonds don t grow their yield after you buy and currently only yield 65 berkshire is not alone but it s the model for these types of companies as an allocator do you buy the asset that had to be saved by the fed during covid despite its lower yeild vs the one that did great without help and a higher yield this is an environment of positive real yield for the foreseeable future so you buy berkshirelike stocks

week ended april 21 recap and thoughts for next week valuation model update no pain no gain marketmoving news 1 the fight against inflation is making progress this week with good news from both domestic and abroad friday s pce fed s preferred gauge for tracking inflation data showed inflation continued to moderate a nice surprise is core pce exhousing was only up by 024 lowest in since summer last year another welcoming development was the uptick of personal saving rate from 48 in march to 51 in april indicating consumer spending continued to cool and even better news came from europe where german cpi lowered more than expectation but the triumph of disinflation was at the price of slow economic growth with us gdp growing at 11 2 estimated and eurozone growing at 01 02 estimated the bond market rallied yield dropped in concern of global economic outlook and 10yr tbill was down 33 for the week boj s decision of keeping its yield curve control policy also contributed to the rally as a result the summary of this week s inflation related news is mostly positive 2 this week s economic indicators were a mixed bag again with some showing improvement while others dropping to new lows another week of mixed data we are seeing signs of recovery and bounce back from previous lows but certainly not out of the woods yet on the global front there were a lot of uncertainty too with austria april pmi declined further from last month and china s april pmi unexpectedly fall into contraction again especially export fall by 28 indicating poor foreign demand in april here is the summary of major economic data from this week focused on the manufacturing side however things are definitely better on the service side card spending still very strong in restraints and bars as well as hotel and other travel but since service normally lags manufacturing i won t put too much weight into it but here is the bottom line consumers today are very well positioned financially with the highest amount of cash tucked away and the lowest debt to asset ratio in decades so the us economy has a very thick cushion even if things are continued to deteriorate from here 3 earnings last week were quite a pleasant surprise but in the end they didn t move the fullyear estimation much we are not at the midpoint of the earnings season sp 500 companies are reporting their best performance relative to analyst expectations since q4 2021 with 79 of companies reporting q1 2023 actual eps above estimates in aggregate companies are reporting earnings that are 69 above estimates while the blended earnings decline for q1 2023 is 37 in terms of revenues 74 of sp 500 companies have reported actual revenues above estimates and companies are reporting revenues that are 21 above estimates the blended revenue growth rate for q1 2023 is 29 looking ahead analysts are projecting earnings growth for the second half of 2023 with earnings growth of 12 predicted for cy 2023 from 219 to 221 my personal take is earnings are much more impactful to individual stock than overall market for sp500 no earnings surprises will move the estimations much whereas the eps multiples is the most important factor to determine where we will land by the end of the year and multiples are mostly affected by liquidity bond yield and economic outlooks more to explain in the next section my positions and predictions us equity valuation after this week s earnings reports sp500 eps increased by $1 from last week see what am i saying the multiple is the key 2023 full year eps $221 ntm $228 2024 full year eps $247 current forward pe 183 lower than 5year average of 185 and higher than 10year average of 173 so in terms of valuation we are essentially the same as last week and if you read my weekend post last week you know my biggest concern is the risk premium current sp500 risk premium is at a decade low level so either bond yield is going to drop significantly which is unlikely given we are still in a tightening circle or valuation needs drop significantly and for valuation to drop either earnings need to grow significantly or stock prices has to give again we are in a contracting economic environment i literally don t see how forward earning growth and significantly beat estimation 12 yoy and grow 20 or even 25 yoy so the upside of the sp500 is very limited but down side risk either a hawkish fed or deteriorating economy is still very really and not at all priced into stock price updated valuation based on risk premium 10year average risk premium is around 335 so if we use 3 risk premium for valuation stock today should have a forward pe of 154 and given ntm eps is $228 and 2024 eps is $247 spx should be at 3511 today and 3804 by year end might be higher since tbill yield is probably lower at year end tailwinds inflation continues to go down while the economy stabilizes disinflation continues last week s pce data confirmed disinflation trend with major inflation contributors like housing consumer spending and commodity price continue to decline the risk of inflation coming back is small but we are still far from fed s target of 2 and since we still have a very tight labor market higher for longer is still the narrative in play the economy is still contracting but showing signs of recovery last week s economic data was once again a mixed bag when looking at leading indicators such as transportation and commodities we are still contracting instead of expanding globally china s pmi miss is quite surprising considering they still have loose monetary policy these trends all point to a cooling economy and inflation but we need to watch closely as overcooling could lead to a recession companies and consumers are doing great q1 earnings was a blast companies are financially in great shape and was able to transfer majority of the inflation to consumers so margins even though lower than last year was still at the level of 2019 and expected to increase going forward ceo outlook ticked up for the first time in q1 since last year consumers are sitting on a nice cushion of cash that may last for the next couple of years both will support earnings growth and health of the economy headwind a tightening environment and risk from potential credit crunch cb liquidity tightening on track same as last week liquidity is still on track to decline but news on boj decision eu better than expected cpi and worse than expected gdp as well as disappointing china pmi have the market speculate a less tight policy globally going forward with bond market rallied across board no news on cb policy changes but this week s fed decision is the absolute focus liquidity currently is on a down trend but still elevated from last year debt ceiling nothing has changed from last week it s still drama in the derivative market cds but it s not priced into the stock market credit crunch while everyone was excited about first republic bank last week it was more drama than creating any real damage to the economy however if this becomes a trend in smallregional banks then that s a totally different story overall credit tightening is not significant see my post on friday but it might be affecting small businesses unevenly a lot more than large corporations also regional banks are heavily exposed to commercial real estate and with declining occupancy rate and in turn their valuations they will be dealing with a lot more unrealized loss pretty soon valuation model and yearend projection i ve decided to simplify my projections and focus only on current data without modeling multiple scenarios removed bull and bear case my base case shown in green predicts sp500 earnings of $221 for 2023 and $247 for 2024 consensus with inflation stabilizing under 4 and continuing to decline the fed will likely hike rates in may and keep them unchanged until yearend before starting to cut them in 2024 the light blue box represents where we are today using a 10year average forward pe ratio 17x a more appropriate level would be 3900 while the risk premium model suggests we should be closer to 3600 x200b i get asked a lot whether i am bullish or bearish i am bearish as i think the stocks are overvalued but not because i think we are heading into a recession i simply think that the eps multiple at the current price is too high so there is very limited upside for stocks but a lot of risks are not priced in i think a pullback of 510 would provide a much better entry point the best strategy right now is probably theta harvesting but where is the fun in that so i have puts on a side note it s been another week of wins for the large growth investment style current positions not changed spy 615 400 put iwm 615 165 put tlt jan 2024 110115 leap call spreads

people who are still holding on to coins i m assuming that people who are holding on to them is because they bought it at above 40k and would rather not sell it at a lost i don t see the point of having a coin at such a time no one uses it at all and it is much more risky than keeping it as cash tbh it ll drop in value over the course of this whole economy crisis and holding on to it only loses value definitely not a good thing to have for the time being when economy goes back up then sure you can hold on to increase its value

am i correct in thinking option spreads are a worse idea than individual stock picking someone told me about the idea of option spreads and i m honestly just being lazy about figuring out if they re a good or bad idea i think they re probably a bad idea and people may not realize how much because they don t consider the cost of the premiums but i figured you guys could tell me if i was wrong most importantly it seems like it s not only betting on individual stocks but betting on individual stocks at certain prices against a generally more wellinformed party am i correct in my thought process here are they even worse or are they much better in some way i m not considering what are the chances of actually making money on them that last question is surprisingly hard to google and get a quick solid answer

81222 spy es futures and apple weekly analysis and market recap if you ask a trader what your favorite kind of day to trade is you are going to get lots of different answers some people love and can only trade trend days others love choppy range days for me my absolute least favorite days during this 2022 bear market to trade are trend days like today the reason why is that fundamentals are pretty much thrown out the window and the price action doesn t match the chart and fundamentals watching spy sit in overbought territory all day long set up for the perfect rest reversal and then blow through resistance like it wasn t even there is one of the most frustrating things out there which brings me to my other frustrating side of this is that we have yesterday which was setup just like today was and came out guns a blazing in the morning and made me fully expect a bigger green day like today however as soon as you buy calls it drops and never recovers then you got days like today that follow it up where you cant even trust the price action cause of what happened the day before on nearly identical setup i swear the mm just like to mess with us the weirdest thing about today for me though was the iv rank generally speaking on a very bullish day like today as price goes up iv rank drops however there were quite a few times today where the iv rank actually raised while price raised in addition todays opening and end iv rank is higher than yesterdays iv rank which was a red day 000 but dumped during the day this did mess with some premiums today as i know i had quite a few people in the server today that mentioned their 0dtes were moving a snails pace like 7dte i know i had a 0dte put qued from about 1115 to noon and the premium despite the price action going away from it barely turned red i also watched a put at one point go up in premium as spy went up too it was very odd today okay now onto the ta pretty big win for the bulls today so lets cover the bull vs bear case for next week and some highlights a lot of people are talking about the 50 retracement mark which is at 42108 apparently this number is significant as most bear market rallies don t break the 50 retracement level also most bear market rallies have apparently averaged about 1012 recovery and we are currently trending at 179 as of close of market today so the question now becomes are we reaching the end of bear market rally or are we already in the next bull market borrowing this picture from ugaur but it shows that we cleared the 50 fib and should be headed to the 60 fib which is around 434 this level is key and aligns with what i see on the daily too actually interestingly enough these fibs overall align with my levels i have on spys daily chart too bull case we have closed over the daily 200ema with three candles now and today we saw that extreme bull momentum return that we had the two weeks before this one we are slowly pushing through all the resistance lines we are headed for the major resistance line of 4322 on monday why does this resistance line matter so much well this resistance line is the last higher lows from spy this uses the high of january 4th and march 29th to give us a resistance line which come monday will be sitting at 4322 effectively if we were to cross over this line one could say bear market is over we would be well out of bear market territory and we would be inching closer and closer back to the ath vs the 52 week low now the real question will come when we touch this level do we break through it and continue a trek to 440 or 458 its possible if we were to continue trending bullish like we are now then i would suspect that we could see 458 by middle of september at the latest if you look at this daily chart with no lines on it and compare the late 2020 2021 bull market to now you can see we actually are trending upward more rapidly then the 2021 bull market even did the 2021 bull market trended over the daily 8ema and then would back test support and the 20 and 50ema ever few weeks or months i suspect we are seeing a retail driven rally and that the rally is going to come to an end eventually bear case despite todays extreme bull momentum and push green the bulls are still showing weakness this mornings price action was mostly driven by sellers not buyers and looking at the previous days from this week its hard to say that buyers are in control 100 we have monthly opex on friday and we also have fomc minutes on wednesday i doubt fomc minutes will be a catalyst but it could be the excuse to shake the markets up and drop us markets are expecting a 50bps hike right now and if there is something at that meeting indicating a 75bps hike regardless this could sell us off with mopex coming up we will finally see all those puts down below expire worthless this august 19th opex is heavily weighted in puts the mm know this and my theory is with this large run up we are going to see everyone rotate into calls and that s when the next sell off comes starting monday the 22nd it would make sense to see a consolidation week here around 430 and then we finally drop we still have two aggressive rising wedges playing out on the daily right now that eventually i envision coming to an end key supports for next week on the daily 4245 black dotted rising wedge support 419 red solid bull support 4175 daily 200ema 4076 daily 100ema key resistance for next week on the daily 4273 4294 black dotted rising wedge resistance 4306 sold black rising wedge resistance 4324 green solid bear market resistance 4381 4465 the futures daily chart shows a very similar picture however i almost think its more clear we have the red bull channel if you zoom out its more of a rising wedge tho but gives us resistance monday at 4295 and support at 4184 there is also the extreme black rising wedge we are in right now too that is 4290 resistance and support 4250 that key level i mentioned on spy green resistance bear market line is 4340 spy weekly we continue to trend in a pretty massive breakout down triangle key weekly resistance is going to be 4327 which interesting enough is the weekly level and the black dotted rising wedge resistance support is at 4196 for this current 9 week long bull channel futures has a similar outlook with 4340 as weekly resistance and rising wedge resistance support for bull 9 week long bull channel is at 4192 which ever of these weekly support or weekly resistance lines are broken first next week i suspect to be the trend for the rest of the month and beginning of september amazingly apple is only 629 from its ath that s absolutely mind boggling when you think about the fact that we are in a bear market right now it will be interesting to see what apple does next week apple is on a near vertical extend that has only accelerated as time has gone on from june 13th to july 22nd we had a nice bull run but from july 26th to today apple is on some unbelievably extreme bull rally for comparison apple has rose 123 from july 26th to today over 13 trading days while from june 13th to july 22nd it rose 136 over 24 days apple has covered almost the same ground upwards in nearly half the amount of time or a total of 259 over 37 trading days for another comparison the march rally from march 14th to march 30th apple rallied 196 over 12 days this run apple is currently on right now during a bear market is the same size and strength that apple went on from october 2021 to december 2021 the only rally that apple has been on of this size and strength is the july 2020 to september 2020 bear market rally and yes it dumped immediately after this might be the strongest and fastest biggest rally that apple has ever been on since covid 2020 crash key daily resistance for apple next week 1741 rising wedge black dotted resistance 1747 bear market resistance line 1791 key daily supports for apple next week 1722 black dotted rising wedge resistance 1694 red dotted support line 1664 red bull channel support the weekly chart for apple looks like someone forgot to change the printer ink and its only printing in green now key weekly resistance is 1745 weekly bear market resistance and 1766 red bull resistance channel key weekly support is 1657 bull weekly support the vix continues to be more and more interesting everyday we rejected again off that support line today however while the vix didn t continue to unwind spy did continue to go up eod today we did see a close below that 197 top 2021 red trend line i am going to be keeping an eye on the vix to see if it gives us any sort of guide into if and when this bear market rally is over if we were to see the vix break over 215 and especially over 22 next week i would start considering that we might be in store for some downside overall my thoughts next week is we are for sure going to see the 430s whether or not we are going to see 440s after that remains to be unseen while i believe the bottom is in i would be shocked that we don t revisit the 370s to fill the gaps on the daily chart we currently have three gaps down below on spy if we were to leave these behind not fill them and just go back onto the next bull market for spy i would be shocked my overall plans for next week is to wait for 430s and wait for apple to hit mid to high 170s from there i will be looking at the vix to signal the top is in i would like to see the vix break over 23 i believe that would be the perfect storm spy touching 430435 apple touching 175 and vix back over 23 from there i think some 60dte puts would be a golden ticket the key if you are going to play puts here long term and you are looking for the downside is to buy yourself some time 30dte would pay like crazy if the drop is just as big if not bigger then the rise remember in june we dropped 13 in 8 days and in april we dropped 17 in 15 days and 115 over 10days in february and of course in january we dropped 14 in 13 days we should be looking for about a 1388 drop over about 115 days for perspective that would be say 435 on tuesday august 16th to a drop of 3746 by september 1st this would fill all the gaps on spy so like i was saying the key here is to buy yourself enough time the perfect sell off and a 30dte is going to pay unbelievably well however if we chop on the way down and this isn t the normal sell off you are going to need a 60dte 30dte with a 12 drop would be about 1400 on a way otm put 60dte with a 12 drop would be 478 on a way otm put just something to think about the key about this though is to not be early if you are early and we still have another week of rallying and we end up hitting 440 or 450 your puts going to be toasted hope you guys have a great weekend lots of good lessons this week youtube weekly video will be up later tonight
inflation is donekinda the fed controls the supply of money supply and demand determines value just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down same thing with money we do not have a demand issue the base economy fuckin sucks we have a supply issue where the fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation well now it s the opposite they will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation but they will cause a recession that may already be here the main component of an economy is consumer spending investment government spending and net exports are the others inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment the fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession as debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people we are starting a nasty cyclethat will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years the fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming but the problem is that we don t actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economyso what is the end result going to be deflation how long for i got no fuckin idea so we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again yesno one has said this yet but the fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don t act properly the problem is i have no idea what to do but i do know one person that does and consistently beats the market when times are tough for equitiesmr buffet go with brkb and close your eyes for the next 12 months

what happened to evergrande and country garden why china s real estate is in a huge ponzi tldr china s property developers move collaterals take debts from banks and issue offshore bonds to acquire new lands and sell offplan units in order to pay off constructions on the older development when new developments stop selling everything goes burst including those offplan sold units which are under construction as it is no more news by now china s property crisis is happening at full speed two biggest property developers evergrande and country garden one just filed chapter 15 bankruptcy and the other one is in the grace period of paying off its us bond and will almost certainly to default there were an article pointing out that chinese real estate development is more of a ponzi scheme than a bubble let me explain more in detail why this is the case article link the real estate development cycles work like this in china 1 first the government will start an auction for real estate development land various property development companies like evergrande and country garden will bid for the development land the winner gets the right to develop and sell the apartment units and collect hoa afterward 2 the winner can sell offplan apartment units before they even start building but they need to put down collateral for all the expenses that require building the apartments 3 after all the units are finished and sold they will have the profit price of total sold units developmentrelated expense the bid for acquiring the land this system is designed nothing out of order however almost all real estate developers instead of having the collateral sitting on their balance sheet doing nothing they move the collateral borrow money from banks and issue bonds simultaneously to bid on more lands and construct new developments this put on huge leverage on those companies in earlier years many lands that they took on are good areas in first and secondtier cities like shanghai beijing shenzhen hangzhou etc the apartment units built on those land were almost sold out immediately when the housing price goes up and the economy is doing well those leverages pay off greatly because the later developed units are always sold out leaving enough money for finishing off earlier developments paying off the debt they took from banks and a fat profit the profit goes to the owner of those real estate developers as a form of stock dividends and those owners move the money offshore through their charities in hong kong this process encouraged the property developers to take on bigger leverage to acquire more new lands and speed up the property development cycles after good lands are all developed the property developer aims to lowertier cities that have less population and economic activities however things changed after covid hit what happens to evergrande and country garden is that after a huge slowdown in china s economy along with the cooldown in the property market average chinese citizens don t have any more money to buy new apartments unit which are under development especially in lower tier cities once the new developments stop selling what is left with those real estate developers are huge debt they took through banks and bonds and unfinished construction in those lowertier cities finally let s look at the stats for evergande and country garden evergande debt $340 billion asset $256 billion country garden debt $195 billion asset $252 billion most of it are iliquid x200b edit the reasoning behind those real estate developers is that housing price only goes up in china basically nonstop for the past 20 year before covid that s literately how china s central bank stimulate economy after 08 when exports drop significantly the money from auctioning lands is the major source of income in many lowtier cities as well on a different topic most of local government in china have huge city development debt as well they are leveraged to the tits x200b
fed pivots here is something really peculiar about the financial markets i ve been seeing much chatter about a central bank pivot and how that might affect the different markets so i looked up some historical data on federal reserve rate policy versus sp 500 price swings what i found was quite fascinating 1 the big variable affecting equities price swings was not so much the pivot from tightening to loosening when the fed holds rates steady after a period of tightening equities move higher and in some cases move to new all time high as long as fed rates are held steady 2 when the fed does actually pivot to loosening after a period of steady rates equities prices drop history seems to indicate that the market perceives a sudden drop in rates as an indication of crisis 3 if exogenous shocks occur at the time of steady rates by the fed those shocks may have far larger impacts on markets than the fed 4 there were exceptions for example in 1980 to 1982 fed funds rates were so large that equities markets remained down until it was clear that the fed would lower rates and not raise them back up 5 the 1980s marked a turning point in response time between fed policy decisions and market response this was likely due to the fed becoming more open with future policy plans it will be interesting to see how market sentiment shifts around if the fed actually does decide to pivot significantly history doesn t repeat itself but it often rhymes

when do you think bbby rise will be intervened it s so nice to see the rise of bbby and to witness a lot of people in this sub making big gains but let s not fool ourselves we only need to recall on what happened when gme went up too fast and started endangering the livelihood of those poor hedge fund managers we know that they will not sit down and let us enjoy our tendies as such let s look at what happened during gme run according to the wikipedia record of gme short squeeze the squeeze start on january 11th at the price of around $1990 by january 28th and after reaching $347 robinhood and other exchanges start restricting trade and thus cancelling the squeeze at the expense of a lot of ordinary gamblers i firmly believe that it is not the matter of if but when they will intervene so my question is when do you think this will happen this time
meme stocks and my ass been looking at the debt levels for so many of these companies and realized the gamestop short squeeze gave that company the ability to erase all its debt liabilites to their creditors companies like amc apparently still owe 6 billion in debt bed bad owes 25 billion ccl carnival owes over 30 billion in debt and the list goes on all these meme companies owe more debt than their valuations just those 3 companies alone owe 40 billion in debt the ability for them to declare bankruptcy would trigger massive losses to the creditors my estimate would be hundreds of billions of debt liability loss when you combine all the zombie companies wouldn t the creditors have substantial interests in causing squeezes to prop the market valuations higher so they continue operating as zombie companies this then does not allow them the ability to declare bankruptcy and forces them into years drawn out of still paying back all that debt that the creditors want just eating chili and coffee for my late morning breakfast over here scratching my own ass lmk what you fools think
what is the rationale behind yoloing it i stick my money in blue chip stocks and etfs like qqq voo schd i have a roth ira and a regular brokerage account and i think i m pretty conservative compared to what i have seen on this sub say what you will but i enjoy the longterm boring buy and hold strategy so can somone explain to me the rationale behind yoloing it maybe it s a fundamental difference of temperament or goals but i seriously do not understand the philosophy of throwing 10k 50k 100k into questionable virtual currencies or short term otm options is there some bigger picture i am missing i m 25 and i see people both younger and older than me making these sorts of decisions so i don t think it s merely a matter of maturity any responses would be appreciated
how did the us recover from the great recession the rhythms of the roaring twenties and great recession seem to be playing out right now with loaned out money being the legs on which this economy ran i understand that the economy broke in the early 30s due to that kind of reliance on anything but cash i understand that ww2 was at least a big help to get the us out of the hole back then but how specifically did the us recover from that hell back then further are those some things that can be done now if we do fall to lows that are at least a fraction of the gr thoughts
why is the 30 year bond considered safe on bearish markets in topics like the bond yield the inverse curve its created when the 30 year bond is being bid up more than the 10 year and 20 year bond and as you know almost every time inverted yield curve has predicted recessions so my question again is why is the 30 year bond considered safe investment during fears of market recessions

sleeper q1 for $coin total trading volume for the platform in q1 22 was the lowest we ve seen in the trailing 4 quarters the 2nd lowest was q3 21 with a total volume of $327b in the first quarter of 2022 the platform did $309b source nomicscom assuming the ratio of retail to institution trading was roughly the same in q1 22 as q3 21 the revenue s from trading would be $1031m vs $1089m but this is where it gets interesting revenue from subscriptions and services in q3 was $145m and in q4 it surpassed $200m the growth rate for ss revenue for the last 3 quarters has been 56 per quarter left off q1 21 because it was an anomaly with 25x increase quarter over quarter with this in mind i expect q1 22 ss revenue to be over $300m if i m right then a very significant thing will happen in the earnings history of $coin there will be a relative increase in revenue despite a relative decrease in trading volume $1331m vs $1234m this is going to highlight one segment of exponential growth that has historically been shrugged off and might cause analysts to take a closer look at their models do i think coinbase is going to pop on earnings no i think there s a good chance we still go lower from here in the short to medium term but i think this data point will mark a shift in the conversation around the company

apple q4 earnings preview all eyes on iphone 14 sales and guidance apple will release q4 earnings thursday after the market after several disappointing earnings posted by its faamg fellows microsoft alphabet and meta a weakerthanexpected quarterly result or guidance will further trigger stocks sellingoff mode still apple s current market cap is around $24 trillion with pe 2465 the stock is down 1554 ytd beating sp 500 s 20 here s what wall street expects revenue $8868 billion 64 yy diluted eps $126 up 2 yy x200b investors should mainly focus on the performance of us and chinese consumers who contributed 45 and 18 company s revenue in q3 the iphone 14 in other regions such as europe and japan saw price increases of 520 compared to last generation due to unfavorable exchange rates and higher costs however prices for those two areas remained the same probably for higher sales iphone global market share increased further and the pro series help driving asp to a record high wall street expects iphone q4 revenue to be 4266 billion up 10 yearoveryear thanks to strong demand for iphone 14 series research firm canalys reported that global smartphone q3 sales fell 9 yearonyear recording third consecutive decline this year however apple was the only vendor in the top five to record positive growth improving its market share to 18 thanks to relatively resilient demand for iphones which includes latest iphone 14 models x200b it is noted that iphone 14 went on sale on september 16 a week earlier than 13 series allowing apple recorded roughly oneweek sales into q4 results the initial demand will also set the tone for the december quarter covers the busy holiday shopping period which typically achieves the highest revenue during the year consumers are more willing to buy costlier pro models this time due to huge improvement compared with 13 pro max equip the latest a16 chip the first ever 48 mp camera and dynamic island etc iphone 14 the base model got slight improvements from iphone 13 but roughly the same price which failed to capture consumers interests due to 14 pro s higher shipment proportion and prices counterpoint research estimated that iphone s asp average selling prices will rise to a record $892 in the september quarter and $944 in the december quarter higher than current record $873 achieved in the fourth quarter of last year but that also means iphone s revenue will be mainly supported by two pro models and it also raises a question can big demands for iphone 14 pro be sustainable throughout the next year currently if someone orders an iphone 14 pro 512g online in los angles it will take at least 34 weeks a week shorter compared with same period last month x200b apple hasn t offered official guidance since 2020 and it may offer this time as well investors will be closely watching what apple says about december quarter the shopping season during the year any forecast or guidance that suggests lighterthanexpected results will be a risk to shares will new apple watch and airpods pro help earnings this time wall street expects wearable devices home and other products q3 revenue of $ 879 billion flat yearonyear accompanying with iphone 14 apple watch series 8 and apple watch se were both available on september 16 while apple watch ultra and airpods pro ii were available on september 23 which will be part of q4 results as well in addition as iphone 14 sells well the accessories cases chargers may also see some growth however analysts seem less bullish we believe wearables are the most discretionary product in apple s portfolio and therefore most prone to the pullback we are seeing in consumer electronics spending morgan stanley s woodring said in a note mac may be the shining star even pc demand slows sharply wall street expects mac revenue for q4 to reach $925 billion flat yy ipad revenue will be $781 billion down 5 yy it is noted that mac revenue for q3 fell 10 yy and ceo tim cook attributed the drop to supply constraints which means apple couldn t make enough computers to meet demand now the supply constraints may not be a serious problem anymore but demand is declines continued for the traditional pc market as global shipments totaled 743 million units down 15 yy during the third quarter of 2022 according to preliminary results from the international data corporation idc cooling demand and uneven supply have contributed to a yearoveryear contraction of 150 x200b consumer demand has remained muted though promotional activity from the likes of apple and other players has helped soften the fall and reduce channel inventory by a couple weeks across the board said jitesh ubrani research manager for idc s mobility and consumer device trackers supply has also reacted to the new lows by reducing orders with apple being the only exception as their third quarter supply increased to make up for lost orders stemming from the lockdowns in china during the second quarter services revenue may slow further apple hiked music tv fee first time ever in q3 apple s services revenue rose 12 yearoveryear to $196 billion the slowest growth rate since 2015 and is expected to slow further this time wall street expects revenue to be $1996 billion up 10 yearoveryear in july apple chief financial officer luca maestri warned investors that while services business would continue to expand its growth rate would slow from 12 during the june quarter citing the strong dollar and economic factors on monday apple raised the prices of its apple music apple tv and apple one in the united states for the first time ever apple said the increase in apple music individual from $999 to $1099 per month subscription price was due to increased licensing costs the company said artists and songwriters will earn more per stream as a result of the pricing tier changes regarding apple tv individual from $1495 to $1695 per month the company said the increased price reflects the growing catalog of original tv shows and movies the price hiking may help services grow somehow though not for q4 x200b overall market still expects strong earnings from apple under macro uncertainties however after tesla microsoft google and meta s disappointing earnings if apple fails investors as well the stock market will surely suffer a further selloff

neural network asset pricing i ve already coded a random forest from this paper and monthly portfolios made using it beat spdr from nearly any starting point between 1987 and 2021 supposably the neural networks made by the authors do a lot better using a similar version of ensemblingtraining multiple models and averaging their predictions to create one average prediction per input this is a neat idea but it could be better instead of taking the average i bet an ensemble of neural nets used to generate a distribution of predictions could be used to greater effect ie use 30 models to generate 30 predictions per monthly input test the performance of portfolios selected based on central tendency and expected shortfall the problem is the current draft model generates the same value over and over no matter the input the fact that it worked for simpler models makes me think it was a modeling error and not a data error anyone know pythonkeras enough to spot the issue in the future it would be fun to create a data pipeline to a website that details the model and recommends monthly buyssells import pandas as pd import numpy as np from scipystats import randint from sklearntree import exportgraphviz from ipythondisplay import image import graphviz import matplotlibpyplot as plt from kerasmodels import sequential from keraslayers import dense batchnormalization from kerasoptimizers import adam from kerascallbacks import earlystopping from kerasregularizers import l1 import tensorflow as tf from kerasmodels import loadmodel sp500 benchmark data sp pdreadcsv sp500csv sp data we need to calculate monthly sp500 returns to benchmark the oos data sp spsp date 19861201 sp date 20220101 calculate the monthly pct change testsp sp close resetindexdroptruepctchangedropna stock market data data pdreadcsv stockcharmonthlycsv data month pdtodatetimedata month data year data month dtyear drop the bottom 20 observations by market capitalization their snr is lowest the stocks are illiquid fama 203 percentilecutoff 02 bottom20 datagroupby month mktcaplag transformlambda x xquantilepercentilecutoff data datadata mktcaplag bottom20resetindexdroptrue target and features target dataretexcess returns dataretadj featdata datafilterregex char years datayear trainstart 1965 teststart 1987 trainidxs yearslocyears trainstart years teststartindex testidxs yearslocyears teststartindex train indices trainbeg trainidxs0 trainend trainidxs11 test indices testbeg testidxs0 testend testidxs11 split xtrain featdatatrainbegtrainend ytrain targettrainbegtrainend xtest featdatatestbegtestend ytest targettestbegtestend test returns testretreturnstestbegtestend neural net 3 hidden layers layers 94 32 16 8 1 activation function relu l1 penalty 10e3 learning rate 0001 batch size 10 000 epochs 100 patience 5 adam default ensemble 5 batch normalization between all layers nmembers 5 models list for in rangenmembers specify model architecture model sequential modeladddense94 activation relu kernelregularizerl1001 modeladdbatchnormalization modeladddense32 activation relu kernelregularizerl1001 modeladdbatchnormalization modeladddense16 activation relu kernelregularizerl1001 modeladdbatchnormalization modeladddense8 activation relu kernelregularizerl1001 modeladdbatchnormalization modeladddense1 activation linear modelcompileloss meansquarederror optimizeradamlearningrate0001 metrics meansquarederror earlystopping earlystoppingmonitor valloss patience5 modelsummary fit the model modelfitxxtrain yytrain batchsize 10000 epochs 100 validationsplit 04 verbose 1 callbacks earlystopping modelsappendmodel yhats modelpredictxtest for model in models yhats nparrayyhats printyhats0

122722 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis i hope everyone had a great christmas spy welcomed us today with the red and green another excruciatingly boring day after the first hour a total lack of volume follow through and overall technical support to moves i saw this chart posted the other day and thought it was very interesting i plan to at the eoy probably over new years 3 day weekend do a 2023 projection for big tech and spy with where we possibly could go but this chart shows that despite tesla seemingly being the easy short that apple msft and google maybe adobe are the best shorts x200b had to repost and block out what comes after 50 cause i guess thats a banned 3 letter word on here x200b here we have the prices as of today 1227 of optimized extreme bear plays for june 2023 for those above tickers i plan to reference back to these throughout the year i want to wait personally until the week of january 9th to open any long plays for me i still believe that apple msft and google are the best play however i honestly worry about how strong msft is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown if i had to pick right now i would get spy apple google and maybe amazon puts netflix adbe nvidia are just too price already and despite the probable tesla downfall i wouldn t buy it without some sort of 2030 relief bounce first well spy continues to be hella frustrating last week i mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360370 however as you can see put in some really strong support at that 3796 area and we have not been able to break that down with that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386390 today even looking at futures overnight which were up 07 at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today however we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn t quite break through taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 3796 to 3863 however when we look at the last 5 trading days besides december 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 3796 todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern bearish pattern i have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before this is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get futes has it too the way i see it that we either open over the blue support line of 3822 02 or we open under the red resistance line of 3804 03 i expect tomorrow to and overnight to establish the next 23 day move on spy if we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 3706 by eow friday if we breakout through the red resistance line and more importantly the daily 8ema then i will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by eow x200b taking a look at futures we are in the exact same pattern as spy daily this nice big diamond pattern here with this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern key resistance of this pattern is 3872 i am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845 we have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now it is a very strong support area if we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn 3805 is the next major support resistance is at 3880 and 3920 x200b tesla is just full on capitulating at this point i cant believe that it dropped almost 12 intraday today tesla has dropped 456 in 17 trading days absolutely impressive x200b with tesla losing 1114 weekly support next major levels i have are 944 and 607 full on death to tesla is 278 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by january 2024 i really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that i could trust entering some puts on it i just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last month were free money on tesla buy a put at these levels but i also think buying a call is straight wasting money i mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on tesla before 12 weeks of consolidation x200b the vix continues to be absolutely detached from reality it appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the vix over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the vix unwind every day which then pushes us up there are some impressive wicks to the upside on the vix we did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema market wise as in price action and technical on spy i would favor a break down to 370 this week vs a breakout to 390 this week however the vix tells a more bullish story however i personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the vix either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the vix with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow daily log x200b i felt like today reminded me a lot of friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation this morning the theta on premiums even my 78dte was aggressive too tough day to trade but was able to get in and out of some plays quickly and play some nice l2l overall not a great day but a green day at least
rtx puts pattern play yolo update so i included my original position my sales and my profits i might have made more if i hwang in there i bought more at 35 and that helped quite a bit with short term options you only need a small move to make money and the way this stock goes green 0005 then red 0005 profit taking is a good idea one these days i will get burned but for now i made more in 2 days than i make in 2 months my main job is i am a teacher so puts on the nexts generation
get ready for onion shortage ii vinnie kosuga boogaloo it seems likely that onion shortages may hit parts of the country due to a listeria outbreak related to onions produced in georgia being recalled the states where the contaminated onions were shipped include florida georgia massachusetts new york and pennsylvania so how can you play this minor potential onion shortage you can t because its illegal to trade in onion futures due to vinnie kosuga due to a successful corner of the onion market by vincent kosuga and sam seigel in 1955 in which they made millions of dollars by buying up 98 the onions available on the chicago mercantile exchange a through futures contracts driving the price sky high and then buying puts on said onions and tricking traders into thinking massive amounts of onions were being injected into the market by moving freightcars of onions around prices crashed causing various onion farmers to go bankrupt and a subsequent real onion shortage occured after the onion market crash and kosuga s hijinks congress decided to pass the onion futures act which made trading in onion futures illegal in the united states
i am bullish on $chyna first off let me say that i clearly understand how bad china stocks have been since their peak in 2021 not only have they come out of the pandemic at an anemic growth rate the housing crisis corrupt government and the list goes on have been very large headwinds however when a stock is trading at 10x pe and still growing at 15 yoy without even touching their ai capabilities i think a lot of these mega cap china stocks are a steal at these prices 1 sentiment is at an all time low literally everyone is done with china stocks and refuses to buy them 2 hedge funds have been piling in since the beginning of the year when $baba was at $67 and $bidu was st $98 3 chinas downturn has likely already happened and the growth story will be back by the end of the year 4 $bidu has a 10 year floor at $90100 if it breaks below that it s game over but until then this is a massive floor to buy at 5 $baba is at ipo price and has grown revenue 10x since then really i m show their are even more contrarian and value indicators to look at but i m convinced i m holding 100s of shares of commons in each and $20k in leap calls across both names they may not reach their peak in 21 anytime soon but i d say they re a safe 50100 gain from here with patience my last point is look at mega cap tech stocks in oct 22 don t you wish you bought $meta $tsla at $90 $aapl at $120 $amzn $goog at $80 this feels like that same chance let me know your thoughts in the comments

why does increasing interest rate matter before i begin sorry for my dumb question but i couldn t find the answer to my question anywhere so my question is why is everyone freaking out about fed increasing the interest rate i know that increasing the interest rate will suppress market sentiment and therefore stabilize prices of course it will slow the economy and growth but they can decrease the interest rate later right so why panic maybe it doesn t matter to me because i m just a poor dumb guy but really if you are looking at your investment in a long term does it really matter

unholy trinity tldr corporate profits are fucked and you know it ok smooth brains i know most of you can t pay attention to anything more than 5 seconds but here is a short summary of the current status for the ones of you who can compared to november 2021 when nasdaq peaked today the rates are up dollar is up and oil is up historically this has been a terrible combination for forward corporate earnings incredibly talented 21year old wall street fortune tellers who have never seen anything like this environment mark the next year s earning expectations for apple the biggest company in sp500 at up 5 earnings estimates for some other noteworthy companies look similar if not higher if history rhymes corporate profits are prone to suffer by at least 1020 if the rates dollar and oil stay at their current respective levels but no one seems to be positioned for it and i have not even mentioned the probability of sustained periods of inflation so far if you noticed your crayons option flows narratives are worthless when the tide goes out do not mistake the ample liquidity of the past years with genius this is not 20102021 you will need different tools than buying fds to navigate this try not to be a man with a hammer evolution is good for you do whatever you will with this information but know that these things take time to play out usually 612 months and watch for a bear steepener in the yield curve interestingly the best leading indicator of a recession is fed cutting rates that s your tell do not expect instant rewardgratification buying 0dte spy puts is not the way to play this fwiw this is not bear porn there are pockets of value appearing although very rare and i think it will be a very fun and rewarding market for stock pickers for the next couple of years

why doesn t nvda have competition this isn t really a procon article just wondering where the competition is the barriers of entry are certainly high you need fabs or the ability to outsource it but those are actually not that impossible to find and even though it might take some time there are dozens of foundries coming online in the next decade which will help any newcomer ramp up this is a great time to establish longterm contracts with manufacturers maybe even help intc come back from utter failure wtf happened to those cats remember when people didn t know if amd would survive bankrupty because intc was beating them senseless pepperidge farm remembers i digress the reality is nvdas greatest tool in their arsenal that will be the main obstacle for any competitor is their longdeveloped software library numerous sdks cuda various other apis and tools given freely to developers even though they cost billions to develop etc they use these free tools to help developers integrate wow features into their game s way ahead of schedule even if most people s machinemonitor can t even utilize it dlss ray tracing physx 3d vision txaa lovelace gsync and a bunch of other crap i can t remember integrating these features into their sdks creates a symbiotic parasitic relationship where game developers almost require consumers to own nvda cards to have the best performance and visual quality an ouroboros of features feeding technology stupidity no one needs c mon gang $1500 for a video card i digress again these do not seem insurmountable obstacles sure it will take a godlike amount of money but there are literally 100s of billions of $ sitting in private accounts waiting to invest in something in 2021 there were 1035 ipos 2022 gave us 181 and so far in 2023 a grand total of 65 i won t even discuss spacs or chinese nonsense stocks smart money is over that shit vc angel investors are champing at the bit to invest in ai and the only thing you have to show them are the margins gg if this seems a hard sell recall a tale of a strange man who once told a bunch of billionaire investors with a straight face that he could simultaneously take on the car and oil industries and he would do it by building electric cars electric cars that were fast and cool all the investors had to go on was the abomination known as the gm ev1 and they gave him the $ this seems less daunting sidenote i would call the new company aaeye tagline we drank the koolaid

pound rises as new uk finance minister brings forward policy announcement to today will the dollar fall what do you think london sterling rose against the dollar on monday morning after new uk finance minister jeremy hunt announced he would deliver parts of his mediumterm fiscal plan later in the session the pound was up nearly 1 to $11288 by early monday morning extending gains after the statement from the uk treasury the decision follows a dramatic day in british politics on friday which included big fiscal uturns from prime minister liz truss and the sacking of finance minister kwasi kwarteng he was swiftly replaced by hunt who is expected to make a statement at 11 am local time on monday the announcements monday would come two weeks ahead of schedule however the full mediumterm fiscal plan is still set to be published on oct 31 accompanied by a forecast from the independent office for budget responsibility something that was lacking in the original minibudget announced on sept 23 which roiled uk bond markets hunt said over the weekend that his priority as finance minister is growth much like his predecessor but he highlighted it would be underpinned by stability the drive on growing the economy is right it means more people can get good jobs new businesses can thrive and we can secure world class public services but we went too far too fast hunt said in a statement released saturday biden original plan was a mistake the international monetary fund gave a damning verdict on the swathe of debtfunded tax cuts after they were first announced in late september uk bonds saw a sharp selloff and the pound hit a record low in the days afterward in a rare statement the imf said the plans laid out by the uk would likely increase inequality and it stressed it does not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture us president joe biden weighed in on the british economy over the weekend describing truss s nowabandoned tax cut plan as a mistake and expressing concern that other nations monetary policies could hurt the united states i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake biden said i disagree with the policy but that s up to great britain biden also said it was predictable that truss had to backtrack the plans he spoke to reporters at an ice cream shop in oregon on saturday

a $veru interesting opportunity the next big covid drug and short squeeze something is brewing at veru inc right now if you look at their linkedin profile there have been many new hires 7 recent regional manager hires executive director of regulatory affairs matthew thompson june 2022 chief business officer prof sergi trilla may 2022 senior commercial business director field team nick dustman june 2022 over 80 new job postings from ashfield engage and inizio partners of veru from all throughout the country responsibilities deliver appropriate and approved information and relevant messaging to target accounts for sabizabulin for covid19 under eua emergency use authorization veru s study was published in the nejm which should dispel the short fears about the validity of the results cbs and the new york times also wrote articles the fda actually encouraged the company to submit this eua application fda encourages veru to submit eua application for covid19 therapy none of this adds up if veru is simply another biotech pump without a shot as shorts seem to believe since sabizabulin is proven safe as was shown in a prostate cancer trial in which people took much larger doses over two years the only real concern is the efficacy there are four criteria that the fda uses to determine the utility of an eua serious or life threatening disease check evidence of effectiveness medical products that may be considered for an eua are those that may be effective to prevent diagnose or treat serious or lifethreatening diseases or conditions check risk benefit analysis no safety concerns check no alternatives currently there is no real treatment for ards so check from the earnings call fda agreed that no additional efficacy studies are required to support an eua or a full nda fda agreed that no additional safety data required to support an eua and collection of safety data under the eua will satisfy the safety requirement for a full nda therefore fda agreed that the request for eua is supported by efficacy and safety data from our positive phase iii covid19 study in hospitalized moderate to severe covid19 patients with high risk of ards and no additional clinical studies are required to support a nda submission the compound sabizabulin is interesting because it is a colchicine like compound colchicine has been investigated for potential at treating covid but sabizabulin is stronger although sabizabulin does bind to the tubulin subunit in the colchicine binding pocket it inserts deeper and tighter in the pocket with more hydrogen bonding than colchicine32 sabizabulin inhibits tubulin polymerization better than colchicine in invitro studies it s possible that the main effects have to do with the androgen receptors i found it interesting that covid is actually much more severe in bald men with androgenetic alopecia another very interesting thing is that men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy have a fourfold decreased risk of covid infection they concluded that men with prostate carcinoma on treatment with adt had a signifcant fourfold reduced risk of covid19 infections as compared to men who were not treated with adt or 405 95 ci 1551059 of the 5273 men on adt only four developed covid19 all of whom recovered in comparison the database identifed 37 161 men with prostate cancer not on adt of whom 114 men developed covid19 and 18 of these patients succumbed to the illness link sabizabulin is actually a repurposed prostate cancer medicine there isn t really an alternative for ards and severe covid however despite the availability of the antiviral remdesivir5 and antiinflammatoryimmunomodulators including dexamethasone 6 antiinterleukin6 receptor antibodies 7 and janus kinase inhibitors8 for hospitalized patients at highrisk for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards mortality and morbidity rates remain significantly high remdesivir has a lot of problems as well it s expensive and difficult to administer from earnings call we are preparing for the global commercial launch of sabizabulin nine milligrams for the treatment of hospitalized moderate to severe covid19 patients who had high risk for ards we have created an infectious disease franchise for this purpose this is anticipated to be a worldwide multibillion dollar opportunity this will be a real chance for significant nearterm revenue for veru based on the time it took other drugs to get approved besides remdsivir because they rushed it it should be approved this week and at latest august 5th the average for other drugs was 53 days which would be this friday this is not financial advice just useful info tldr summary lots of new hires and job openings suggesting a high degree of confidence fda encouraged veru to submit eua stating that no more efficacy or safety data is needed high short interest around 50 only stock on finviz with high institutional ownership insider ownership over 30 short with an analyst buy rating study was published in very prestigious nejm showing 55 reduction in mortality current treatments suck baldies get the vid but those taking prostate drugs don t

hey dummies the institutions lead the charge all of you who can t wrap your heads around why stocks go up and down regardless of earnings reports don t know how this shit works if you re here you re a retail investor owning a thousand shares of this or that is penises compared to what the actual market makers carry when they have $100 000 000 in shares of one company and think it s reached its peak for awhile they sell a shit ton to buy something they think will go up market floods with excess stock prices go down you re left scratching your head all that to say follow what the institutions are doing fuck what apple says when they reveal how many new iphones they sold you can t afford one anyway you are so far disconnected from the actual earnings of the company you would get more value sticking your finger up your ass and sniffing it for 23 minutes

navigating the fed meeting next week tldr read bullet points and funny numbers if you are a trader this is probably the most important calendar you should be keeping track right now if you have been living under a fucking rock the fomc meetings are basically when the fed meets and makes major monetary policy decisions namely what the hell to do with interest rates all eyes have been on these decisions ever since the fed became far more hawkish late last year although people are always watching the fed in an effort to fight inflation since then pretty much every other god damn day we have seen brainard or bulltard or meister or whoever the fuck releasing little statements like meister sees 25bps hike as appropriate or bulltard sees ten 50bps hikes as a good idea or more recently fed sees fifteen 75bps hike necessary basically just increasing as time continues and inflation the market has slowly attempted to price in many of these statements as seen by the fact that we haven t made all time highs in about 4 months and are shitting the bed to easily see what rates are currently being assumed just use this tool if you struggle with reading numbers this thing is saying the market has already priced in a 50bps hike however it isn t that simple if the market is already pricing in what is 99 going to happen then why is the meeting even a big deal this is because the fomc meeting isn t just about the rate decision it s about the outlook for future decisions this is just like how when a company reports earnings the guidance is often more important than the actual report unless they wildly missbeat expectations that s why it isn t as simple as oh the market is pricing in a 50bps hike in other words what is said at the meeting will have huge implications for how the market prices in the next meeting which will no doubt be the source of the largest moves coming out of next week anyway i could go on but let me get to the point the actual shit you can take from this since i know reading is your guys weakest subject i ll even use bullet points to keep it one line at a time fed do meeting on may 34th fed talk big about bad interest rate things for months mr market dump ahead of time to price bad thing in mr market will do uppies if decisionsexpectations are less than or equal to what is priced in mr market will do dumpies if decisionsexpectations are more than what is priced in so to sum it all up we don t really know what the fuck is or isn t currently priced in but we can assume that if the market is shitting itself continuously going into the meeting it s probably pricing in something extra bad the fact of the matter is the fed can t magically fix inflation by hiking interest rates don t get me wrong it will help but it won t fix things alone inflation isn t just about rates in our current situation it s also largely about the supply chain rate hikes won t fix the supply chain the fed knows this so although they are teasing going to extremes to fight inflation it s unlikely it gets to that point and it s more likely they are bullshitting to stave off the pitchforks and torches lastly let s talk about how to play this i ll be waiting until later in the week to make a decision on this or even early next week since i really would like to see where the market is just beforehand there s a couple ways to go 1 if mr market is down bad still vix puts itm julylater or call credits 2 if mr market bounces hard before hand stay the fuck away edit i say vix puts because people like to hedge a shit ton going into fomc and vix is running super high if we bounce that shit will crash hard and fast these will profit even if the market is flat so long as putholders give up it s basically the highest probability way to play a less than or equal to result thanks for coming to my ted talk

tesla is way overpriced beyond all the hype and fanaticism tesla is way overpriced with a 45 pe ratio as a car maker the only thing it had going was growth and profit margins with competition heating up both those are going away and the only other reason was their tech promise of autonomy which so far as all but proven to be hypedriven by musk pretending agi is going to take over the world tomorrow furthermore tesla has no real economic or technological moat not like any of the tech giants like google microsoft apple and meta they have a monopoly on tech products and servicesplatforms they have network effects which tremendously increases their value tesla has none because it s a car company there s no network effect on cars he desperately wants to make it such that there is but there isn t not unless you have to pay a subscription to own it nor does more people owning teslas make the network more valuable selfdriving is not networkeffect enabling in fact anyone once you have selfdriving tech can add it to their cars chinese ev companies can add selfdriving to their cars the same as tesla there s nothing tesla has that another ev company can t copy you know the real reason tesla is worth so much besides the reasons above that are going to go away soon elon musk s twitter followers there s a reason he is so famous and popular because of his twitter followers he has 130m followers which is his megaphone he can blare out to the world with and single handedly drive all the advertising value any company could bring that s the memetic and virality value he brings to his fanbase and fanboys who worship him like a celebrity idol that s why the stock price is so high which is also why he bought twitter to make sure he has full control over his sensationalism but when fundamentals come knocking and his promises start falling short back to earth hype can only do so much when they realize he is just a human and his company isn t do anything that can capture value like real monopolistic companies like the big tech companies can with their tech moat and network effects visualmod you re wrong about tesla the company has a lot of technological advantages that other car companies don t have for example their battery technology is far superior to anything else on the market and they are constantly innovating new ways to improve upon it additionally their autonomous driving technology is also very advanced and will give them a major competitive advantage in the future as selfdriving cars become more prevalent finally tesla has a strong brand identity which gives them an edge over other car companies battery tech is not a technology moat it is only a matter of time when others can catch up and there are other companies that can produce superior batteries like catl which is a chinese battery company that has the highest density batteries autonomous driving is also not a technology moat other selfdriving cars will be normal in the future many chinese evs are already showing their selfdriving tech that is similar to tesla s and autopilot has yet to be proven to be capable of full selfdriving meta s ai research is capable of soon replicating the needed technology for selfdriving with the segment anything model

$manu undervalued with 90 upside in late november manchester united football club announced that the club was going to be exploring strategic alternatives ie a sale the current owners the glazer family have run out of capital to bring the club to where it needs to be given the current capital structure and poor mismanagement of the club over the past 17 years the mismanagement and commercialization of the club has been exposed multiple times by high profile managers and players jose mourinho louis van gaal ralf ragnick zlatan ibrahimovic and most recently cristiano ronaldo club facilities are far behind their peers the squad has been completely overhauled and the club have lost their identity as a promoter of youth talent the stock has risen 75 in the past two weeks but is still 10 off september 2018 highs given the attractiveness of cross border deals right now i am assuming that the club will be purchased for 7bn pounds by a megarich billionaire or collective of highnet worth individuals the stock is currently trading at 37bn usd leaving about 90 upside if the deal goes through given current currency conversions the chelsea deal earlier this year took approximately 3 months from announcement to close so i expect this to take about the same with a completion date in spring 2023 the key risk here is what strategic alternatives truly entails though unlikely it is possible that the glazers will only sell a minority stake rather than a complete takeover i believe this to be unlikely given the current rumors and hiring of strategic advisors on both sides the raine group and rothschild ultimately the value here is the goodwill associated with the $manu brand they are still a leading club despite their recent struggles and sportscrossborder deals are extremely attractive right now disclosure i am long $manu equity with an expected 34 month hold period i am not a financial advisor

calculated risk in adding specific ev exposure my case for $psny hello i will start by saying the market is in a weak period and perfomance can be hindered by other economic factors this does not deter me from investing in companies that i see gaining market share i am fundamentally a value investor and i understand that polestar is valued expensive still however based on recent performance and also the increasing number of vehicles on the road i see a strategic and conservative entry point for this company simple dd the cars are everywhere the name is getting out there and deliveries are ramping up quarter over quarter the cars themselves are beautiful and are geared to appese the perfomance and high end market that bmw and benz is desparately trying to tap with evs today the ceo had a conference regarding trajectory and production timelines the company believes it will be profitable by 2025 that is a much faster time frame than tesla was able to accomplish this gives confidence the company is driving meaninful growth and is accelerating their market share capture also look at this car its just sexy polestar 5 scheduled 2025 x200b polestar 2 available now x200b extra dd and numbers deliveries polestar has achieved a record annual delivereies this year already it is on track to deliver up to 70 000 vehicles this year that s an incredible amount considering the amount of competition and headwinds the industry faces thomas ingenlath polestar ceo comments as expected deliveries have continued to gather pace from month to month resulting in a record second quarter i m confident this trend will continue into the seasonally stronger second half of the year which will also see the first deliveries of our significantly upgraded polestar 2 with up to 22 longer range more than 20 permanent polestar spaces are planned to open over the coming months as we expand our footprint and shift from temporary locations into larger facilities that can accommodate our growing lineup i m really pleased that the first polestar 3 display cars will be arriving in our spaces in the coming weeks revenue the company s net loss for the period was $3041 million or 14 cents per share on an adjusted basis it had a loss of $3344 million a year ago polestar s net loss was $2282 million or 12 cents per share its adjusted loss was $2962 million for that period revenue for the second quarter jumped to $6852 million from $5891 million during the same quarter last year polestar delivered 15 765 vehicles in the second quarter up 36 from a year earlier and a total of 27 841 vehicles in the first half of 2023 the company reiterated the guidance it provided in may saying that it still expects to produce between 60 000 and 70 000 vehicles in 2023 with a gross margin of 4 for the year polestar s gross margin was 14 in the first half of 2023 and 49 in 2022 in todays conference the ceo reiterated the 4 margin and stated this was due to a number or hurdles involving production of polestar 3 and other headwinds and gross margins are projected for 25 in 2024 onwards and will be proiftable by 2025 this is a huge difference the stock has not yet priced in this news as of last year polestar automotive holding uk had revenue of $265b in the twelve months ending june 30 2023 with 4383 growth yearoveryear revenue in the quarter ending june 30 2023 was $68525m with 1633 yearoveryear growth this puts a projected annual revenue of $4 billion by 2026 with net operating income of 400 million net cash flow is hard to estimate at this time but as capital expenditure will decline by 2025 net cash flow should be par to income i encourage you to discuss what you have read and give feedback i am always looking for other perspectives so please feel free to go wild tldr polestar undervalued buy stock cheap sell stock high big revenue in 2 years hmm good grug

rip walmart walmart has a lot more room to fall and here are some of the reasons why x200b 1 walmart is beta testing some new self checkout machines at certain locations these machines will actually let persons under the age of 21 and even under 18 purchase alcohol without an employee having to type in a code it s as easy as clicking ok this can cause walmart a lot of legal trouble and potentially cause them to lose their license to sell alcohol at those locations don t believe me if you re in a city that has some go try it 2 walmart still uses mainframes yup you read that right mainframes the good thing is that they are trying to move off of their mainframes however the bad thing as we all know is that for a company like walmart to do this it will take a lot of time and mistakes their warehouses are about to get super fucked up 3 the new self checkouts are supposed to leverage ai such that persons checking out need not scan any items well this opens a huge door for loss theft as the ai system simply not catching an item will mean the customer gets it for free likewise it will become a lot easier for customers to steal $5 to $10 worth of groceries on a $100 basket that s their margin and then some 4 walmart like everyone else is trying to push the ancient idea of grocery store fulfillment this is how grocery stores used to work where you give them an invoice for items and they fulfill your order and bring them to your car why is this bad doesn t it decrease theft sure maybe but more likely the customers doing this have money and so they aren t the type of customer who would steal additionally these customers who have money now no longer have to take their kids through the isles thus they don t get tempted to buy shit they don t need be it for themselves or to get that 4 year old to stop throwing a fit tldr walmart is fucked

lindy effect in investing i analyzed the performance of 73 companies that were more than 100 years old and benchmarked it against sp 500 nassim taleb in his 2012 book antifragile expanded on an interesting idea known as the lindy effect if something has been around for a long time then the probability that it will stick around for a longer is high this partially explains why people still read shakespeare and socrates but forget the bestsellers from the last decade if a book has been in print for forty years i can expect it to be in print for another forty years but and that is the main difference if it survives another decade then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years this simply as a rule tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not aging like persons but aging in reverse every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy this is an indicator of some robustness the robustness of an item is proportional to its life for the perishable every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy for the nonperishable every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy nassim taleb half of all companies fail within five years and 80 in the first 20 years however some companies become outliers and survive for hundreds of years so in theory the lindy effect applies to companies take cocacola for example the company was founded in 1892 and survived the great depression two world wars and the 1980s cola wars just to name a few not only did the company survive all this it has thrived and increased its dividends for the past 61 consecutive years based on the lindy effect cocacola has a better chance of making it to the next century than google if you are a value investor this is an important but often overlooked factor ultimately the company valuation is based on the present value of future cash flow the problem with the current valuation technique is that we always project that the company will survive in perpetuity this is why it becomes so hard to value companies in their growth stage a classic example is that during the dotcom bubble economist burton malkiel pointed out that at cisco s implied growth rate cisco was only 15 years old at that time it would become larger than the entire us economy within 20 years but once a company has matured it will have an established brand a loyal customer base and a strong market position making it easier to assign a fair value to the company buffett understands this intuitively and it s one of the key reasons why he only invests in established companies the average age of the top 10 holdings of berkshire is 113 years with seven companies older than 100 years x200b berkshire hathaway s top 10 holdings performance of lindy stocks survival is only half the story what i am really curious about is how legacy companies have performed over the long run on one hand older firms will have better structure more efficient processes better levels of productivity and an easier time attracting new talent but on the downside older firms will have a negative base effect they tend to be larger lower sales growth and tend to move slowly to test this i am leveraging this excellent dataset created by boris marhanovic where he consolidated all public companies in the us that were more than 100 years old there were 485 companies on the list and after some data cleaning we are left with 73 target companies that we can consider as lindy stocks to give you a flavor of the type of companies that we are investing in below are the top 10 companies from our list of lindy stocks fun fact general electric was the largest company in the world in 2001 now it s 60th in the sp 500 the results are surprisingly in favor of the lindy stocks $100 invested in lindy stocks would have grown into $776 676 return compared to only $486 386 return if you had invested in the sp 500 the cherry on top was that this outperformance was achieved with comparable portfolio volatility 123 and max drawdown 55 to that of the sp 500 winners losers and some caveats as with all portfolios power laws are applicable here as well a few of the winners contributed a major chunk of our portfolio gains even though we filtered for a minimum of $1 billion company valuation as of 2000 firms like moody s equifax hershey etc managed to give us a 1 000 return but being a 100yearold legacy company did not prevent you from wipeouts ge was the biggest company in the world in 1999 and it has fallen by 25 in the last 20 years this is the same period during which the sp 500 was up 400 other famous names include citigroup which never regained from the global financial crisis and uniss corporation which never actually survived the dotcom bubble the astute among you might have noticed that we equally split the investments across our lindy portfolio if we do a marketcapweighted portfolio the results are not so impressive and the portfolio slightly underperformed the market this was mainly due to the biggest companies in the list ge 125 corning 9 and exxon mobil 75 all underperforming the market during the past two decades there are a few more limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate this portfolio raw data and holdings are shared at the end of the sheet our portfolio is not rebalanced annually nor is it updated every year with the new companies that make it into the 100year list the analysis is prone to survivorship bias given that we started with companies that were surviving as of 2017 there might be other 100yearold companies that died off between 2000 and 2017 i believe a few less objective quality checks like the industry tailwind management competence etc could have improved our returns considerably more data 1 list of public companies that are more than 100 years old here 2 lindy portfolio with stock data here

i do not understand the bear case for china according to reddit these are the most important bear cases 1 communist dictatorship without property rights 2 tension with the west 3 slowing population growth 4 fraudulent accounting none of these should remotely be news to anyone who has been following the chinese stock market since its inception in the 1990s why should investors who had no problem bidding up chinese stocks to the highs in 2007 2015 or even as recently as 2021 despite these issues sell now at multi decade lows you can search for redditbloomberg posts to get an idea of the general sentiment of china around the highs consider the upside risks at these levels 1 xi passes laws supporting private enterprise to regain trust of investors 2 still strong gdp growth at 5year even while facing so many headwinds 3 healthy transition from property to consumer led economy just by a valuations comparison with the us alone china is now trading at pes seen during the 2008 gfc and 1974 inflation crisis when the market bottomed

spirit in the sky $save acquisitionlawsuit summary jetblue has been looking to acquire and purchase spirit airlines since february last year at a price of 38b or $3350 a share jetblue s largest reason to do this is gain spirit s jets and workers spirit airlines operates an allairbus fleet of nearly 200 active narrowbody aircraft currently airbus is having delays and purchasing new jets in a very lengthy wait on top of that jetblue has a worker shortage and could benefit from the workforce that spirit has lawsuit the doj raised a lawsuit in march of this year claiming that jet blue would remove one of the only options for budget airline tickets if the lawsuit is dropped or jetblue wins the merger will almost guaranteed go through that lawsuit is supposed to have an outcome as soon as late november or early december why to buy now usually this kind of news related mergers or fda approval kind of stock plays are complete gambles with most of the profits priced in and way more room to lose then win but i think with how long this merger has been in talks that a lot of investors have lost steam and prices have fallen allowing for huge upside gains while downside remains limited in the case the court blocks the merger or the rare case the lawsuit is dismissed but jetblue pulls their offer i think spirit has only so much room to drop they are a company that was hit hard this year yet still earns revenue and some might say is undervalued a dismissal of merger might only temporarily drop the stock 2030 while if it goes through would be a potential 200 gain you only have to be right a small percent of the time for it to be a profitable play i would love to get other peoples opinion though on what they think a possible outcome of spirit stock would be if it falls through or if they have other opinions on the lawsuit or entire situation as a whole this is not financial advice and there is always risk involved invest at your own risk

fubotv pre world cup hype is it gonna moon walleye capital llc just acquired 225 586 shares of fubotv leading to the assumption that it is likely to rise in value 35 billion people watched the 2018 world cup assuming that half that number actually watched on cable or a streaming servicepaid for coupled with the greater number of fans not going to this world cup due to qatars regulations around alcohol and other items it s reasonable to assume quite a few people will be paying one service or another to watch the games adding revenue to fubotv for this quarter at the minimum with a high volume of sells this morning cause it to drop in value and opening a position for investors to get in i think they ll have a pretty comfortable sub growth for q4 and the wc will positively impact revenue and value

average losing trader vs consistently winning trader 60 can go upto 70 best of the traders have this kind of accuracy what separates them from average retail trader is proper research risk management and psychology why do they always make money and not you mindset this differentiates a winner from a loser they make losses way more than we can ever digest but they believe on their system which they have curated with toiling and researching hard even after making a string of losses they stick to it but what do you do just in a matter of 23 losses you will start cursing your system like it s the most pathetic system ever just there at that moment you lose it and they win each time keep refining yourself your system learn new things in market but if you are not making money in the market you only have yourself to blame
call from morgan stanley rep discussion call from morgan stanley rep x200b i am a long time fidelity customer who is considering a move to morgan stanley to combine accounts with my fiance i think highly of both companies but received a call today that was a little unusual ms has kept very detailed notes about my investments and where i trade at after a few moments he asked if i still held amc gme and a few others he asked how many amc and i told him 12 000 plus and he said to not sell and they would love to help me set up an account with them he even offered me a very attractive interest bearing account to move money his way he asked me to send a screen shot of my holdings to see how they can help me reach my goals he did say i should hang on to the amc i think they are a good group but this was an unusual phone call what are your thoughts

i am yoloing it all on weed that s right call me crazy but if weed stocks rise by monday you ll call me a genius i will report back soon cgc here s why as i had noted in previous posts cgc beat street estimates on their earnings and i expect as some others are in published articles that the company will again beat street estimates on the upcoming qtr report in my view the negative bets the bears have their story wrong on this one with the positive bets the bulls who are betting on higher prices coming as being in the right as it stands based on current numbers the company is grossly undervalued in comparison to others within the sector based on fundamentals such as price to sales ratio using tlry as comparable stock price to book and the enterprise value which all indicate that the marketcap number is too low if you are wondering why we are seeing sites issuing revised estimates of $10 to $12 on the shareprice you will likely get your answers i would advise math over a magic 8ball any day of the week but to each their own another factor which i am taking into consideration is the pending reclassification of cannabis to a schedule 3 drug which will loosen things up nicely for cannabis companies and allow them to do more business in the united states i am bullish on this coming into a reality in the near term as i see it being pushed by the dea and of course with over 40 us states having cannabis legalized in one way or another it tells me that the people as a majority wish to see this made into a reality elections upcoming what is a good way to get votes the final factor which makes me believe that the shareprice will remain trading over the $1 usd mark is this the shorts for those who understand the trade you will realize that shorts are under contract to buy in order to close out their trade and either take a profit or take a loss short position traders count of selling borrowed shares at one price and then buying back new replacement shares later in theory at a lower price for long position shares those who look forward to an increasing shareprice the downside risk of trading is being tempted to sell at a loss and not to patiently wait for better prices the downside for short position traders is when the shareprice actually goes up considering there is no theoretical cap as to how high a shareprice can go the losses on a short position trade that goes wrong is actually unlimited but a yolo at $1 has comparatively negligible risk this is where you hear of traders having to mortgage their homes to cover losses on the market it s the only way you can lose more money than you actually put into a trade even warren buffet doesn t risk shortposition trades as they can be too costly my speculation is that the large hedge funds are not going to gamble on the $1 usd mark and that they will start to cover back soon considering cgc is so close to regaining it s nasdaq listing requirement of 10 consecutive days above $1 usd large hedge funds deal in millions of shares and once they start buying back they will have little to no choice but to increase the shareprice it is reasonable to suspect that these large funds are in the money therefore will have no issue with buying back their short positions with the shareprice increasing as they cover it will trip out the shortstops of smaller players which again will result in autobuying on the open market when such an event occurs it is called a shortsqueeze when it occurs to the level which was seen on gamestop it is called a gammasqueeze the smaller shorts who fail to buy back prior to their margin calls simply go poof with their trading and investment days likely ending abruptly also cgc has a ton of deals with us markets ready to go and snoop i am not asking anyone to agree with me on this but i would encourage you give it some thought and to research the various topics i touched off here feel free to copy this post to other forums if you like to discuss with others or even bring it to friends you know who invest to see what their thoughts and opinions might be on the subject tldr cgclow price big potential for multiplying moneynfa
elon hostile take over $twtr for as long as musk is serving on the twitter board or 90 days after he can t own more than 149 of twitter s stock either as an individual or as a member of a group the filing says musk will serve as a class ii director until 2024 but if elon decided to not take the seat in the board he can buy more than 149 of twitter shares twitter ceo did the board member move to elon as away to prevent take over by elon and very recently elon rejected the board member seat so hostile take over will be the next elon move
uvix and svix a tale of two yolos there has been some discussion lately regarding vix the so called marker fear indicator the smoothbrain summary is that vix is based on spx options and is inversely correlated with the market s performance market go down vix go up and vice versa whenever a black swan market catasrophe occurs vix will shoot up such as in the wake of the 2020 covid crash two new securities become tradable tomorrow uvix a 2x leveraged etf of vix and svix a 1x inverse short etf of vix currently uvxy is tradable which is a pussy baby bitch boy version of uvix only 15x leveraged but i m such a degenerate gambler that 15x leverage doesn t get me hard anymore so i m glad they re coming out with the 2x neat fact these securities equivilents were discontinued in 2018 due to an event known as volmageddon where volatility got so crazy that it almost wiped the funds out and now they re back what makes them think this time will be any different i have no fucking idea one of these will make you rich the other will bankrupt you which one to pick only time will tell if you believe the pump will end soon go with vix uvxy uvix depending on your level of degeneracy if you expect the pump to continue short vix or buy svix tomorrow some people are saying vix has bottomed out however i believe there is more room to go down and this crazy pump to continue if the war in ukraine ends or we get better than expected economic data it could us back to the all time high and maybe higher but in the longer term market is fucked and the inevitable crash will cause vix uvxy to soar but its better to go with the current trend than try to time the reversal my plan is to go in on a small svix position tomorrow and build upon it as this stupid pump continues if the market returns to reality i will sell my svix and go long uvix hoping to have a large position in place before the next crash disclaimer leveraged etfs are dangerous as fuck and will tear you a new asshole if not traded carefully they don t recommend holding these things more than a day thats how crazy it is they also decay over time due to constant reverse splits so if the market stays flat they will lose money position none because these etfs aren t tradable yet 330 edit as you may have noticed liquidity is shit on these new funds right now i have no idea when it could be expected to pick up i opened a small svix position 369 shares using a limit order hopefully liquidity improves soon

biotech option plays too good to be true i think im just having an autistic moment here but after thorough dd im trying to see whats wrong with a potential strategy so everyone knows biotech companies have very binary performance especially newer smaller companies that are based off one products success or failure and that 90 roughly of all start up biotech companies will fail trying to bring a product to market my idea is as follows you have a 100k portfolio and you divide it into 10 biotech plays by buying weekly deep otm puts for dirt cheap on the week of a clinical trial results yes i know they have a premium during this time but that shouldnt matter at all you should win roughly 9 times out of 10 and when you win you should win very big side notes 1 i wanted to add is i understand you could have a losing streak on a few but if the rule of thumb is 90 fail then that shouldnt deviate to drastically over a long period of time 2 i would like to say that i have tried this at first with a paper account then with real money and have had success with the small amount of losses being half attributed to me not know what clinical trial phases were most important but i want to see everyone s opinion on if im just lucky or if this could be a viable strategy

famous shortseller jim chanos remains short amc and long ape amc s preferred equity units amc issued ape in order to use the proceeds to repay refinance redeem or repurchase existing debt what is your current bias on amc 72ytd amc entertainment stock was sinking fast on monday and had dropped more than 11 in trading after the theater chain announced a new distribution agreement to sell up to $14 billion worth of ape shares the socalled ape shares or amc preferred equity units have the same economic value and voting rights as a share of common stock the idea was for amc to use the proceeds from the sale of the new stock to repay refinance redeem or repurchase existing debt as it said in monday s filing the apes are even named after the meme traders that helped to boost the company s stock price last year the market however soured at that idea and while the apes are up on the day they ve dropped 41 in value in the past month since the new stocks were first announced by chief executive officer adam aron on august 22 at a price of $6 now sitting at $378 meanwhile amc s stock itself over that same period has also dropped 211 while it was disclosed that up to 425 million shares of apes would be sold the announcement is a placeholder and does not specifically indicate how many will ultimately be sold or by when aron has previously argued that since the shares are going to already existing shareholders rather than going directly on sale apes would not dilute amc s stock value with the creation of apes amc is deeply and fundamentally strengthening our company given the flexibility that apes will give us we will likely be able to raise money if we need or so choose which immensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through this pandemic to recovery and transformation aron said in the letter announcing their creation last month source

technology layoffs show highflying sector not immune from slowdown canada s technology sector has grown rapidly in recent years as homegrown startups and foreign giants set about hiring hundreds of thousands of welleducated and talented workers but that expansion has recently slowed to a crawl as high inflation interest rate hikes and a downturn for cryptocurrency have taken a lot of optimism out of the sector chris albinson ceo of waterloobased incubator communitech says the pullback in the us is more pronounced because there are more of what he calls go for the moon companies with dubious fundamentals suddenly finding themselves unable to adapt to the new reality canadian tech companies are faring comparably better at the moment because generally speaking they are much better stewards of capital he says but that doesn t mean there isn t anxiety there are some founders that were 18 years old when the last recession happened he told cbc news there s going to be stress on the system but i think they re ultimately going to come out of that much stronger valuations for tech giants like meta amazon apple and netflix have cratered in recent weeks and where once there was a fierce war for talent many tech giants are implementing hiring freezes and even cutting staff us streaming giant netflix announced thursday it s cutting another 300 jobs the second time in as many months it has announced layoffs of that size crowdsourced website layoffsfyi has documented more than 20 000 tech job cuts in the past two months alone mostly in and around major us technology hubs like seattle and san francisco while cutbacks in canada are less dramatic they are happening canadian financial tech unicorn wealthsimple laid off 13 per cent of its staff last week citing unprecedented levels of volatility in explaining the cut of roughly 160 positions many of our clients are living through a period of market uncertainty they ve never experienced before ceo and founder michael katchen told staff in announcing the news

i hope you all enjoyed endless free meals at work in the 20212022 years essentially in 2021 they passed the consolidated appropriations act caa that allowed businesses to deduct 100 of restaurant meals to help the industries after the pandemic in 2023 this is now set to go back to 50 deductible many businesses will likely take away some of these benefits and use the recession as an excuse now to further explain this people like you and me don t deduct restaurant meals off our income that s a luxury businesses have to encourage employee satisfaction and help the hospitality industry before the caa was passed businesses could only deduct 50 of the restaurant meals off their income so the free food may come to an end your waistline can enjoy a nice break

how will foxus stock prices behave due to the fifa 2022 world cup in qatar disclaimer sources for 15 at the end of the text i usually don t care about sports but i found out that fox and telemundo own rights to broadcasting the fifa 2022 world cup in the usa1 i m curious how this event will affect fox it is clear to me that broadcasting the world cup will make something to fox s stock especially when the usa team managed to qualify for this year s cup in qatar usaengland has delivered an alltime audience record for a men s soccer game in the us 154 mil views2 it should be obvious to everyone that usairan will also make some noise i am betting that even without the usa playing in the final match it will set some records especially since you don t get that much interest in soccer in the usa very often example the 2018 fifa world cup had an average of 504 million viewers on fox sports and telemundo 37 less than in 2014 806 million and 11 less than in 2010 565 million 3 i know that this year isn t over yet but it was interesting and full of different situations in the world that made fox stock price fluctuate4 additionally in the longer term i found out that fox sports has an exclusive contract for broadcasting the 2023 world baseball classic5 which is a far more popular sport in the usa so this may be even more interesting x200b what do you think about that x200b sources 1 2 3 4 chart from the robinhood website 5

legendary investor stanley druckenmiller says there is a high probability the stock market will be flat for an entire decade do you agree after a hotterthanexpected inflation reading spooked investors on tuesday the dow jones industrial average sank over 1 200 points in the stock market s worst showing since june 2020 that same day stanley druckenmiller one of wall street s most respected minds argued that the pain won t be temporaryand that stocks face an entire decade of sideways trading as the global economy goes through a tectonic shift there s a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for 10 years sort of like this 66 to 82 time period he said in an interview with alex karp ceo of software and ai firm palantir druckenmiller added that with inflation raging central banks raising rates deglobalization taking hold and the war in ukraine dragging on he believes the odds of a global recession are now the highest in decades and given druckenmiller s track record investors would be wise to heed his warnings the legendary investor founded his hedge fund duquesne capital in 1981 and routinely outperformed the majority of his peers on wall street over the coming decades delivering an annual average return of 30 from 1986 to 2010 according to yahoo finance but druckenmiller really made his name when he led george soros s bet against the british pound in 1992 helping the billionaire pocket a cool $15 billion profit in a single month druckenmiller eventually shut down his hedge fund in 2010 and converted it into a family officea type of private firm established by wealthy families to manage their moneyas many hedge funders typically do when they unofficially retire but the leading investor s views are still widely followed on wall street full article

basic abbreviations and concepts thanks to which he will be able to understand the comments and analyzes well one such concept is the day of the three witches what s behind it what is the day of the three witches on the stock market what does the day of the three witches mean when you start your adventure on the stock market you may come across a variety of terms specific only to the stock market one of the most interesting twists in investing on the stock exchange is the day of the three witches it occurs at the end of each quarter ie four times a year the day of the three witches definition three witches day is a popular term for the third friday of every month in a quarter the highest volatility of share prices is then recorded on the financial exchanges the last trading hour also known as the three witches hour is special on these days this is when index futures stock options and index alternatives expire in other words it is at this point that the quotation prices on the longterm market are established the day of the three witches occurs at the end of each quarter ie it is celebrated four times in a given year more precisely it takes place on the third friday of march june september and december for the first time the day of the three witches was noticed in the 1980s in the american market the name of the three witches refers to william shakespeare s macbeth drama as the character of a witch has always appeared in scenes with a mysterious character the hour of the three witches on the day of the three witches the most important moment is the hour of the three witches this is when the greatest volatility on the stock market is noticeable this is because the price is near at which all expiring derivatives will be settled stock investors must be well prepared for the hour of the three witches due to the extremely high volatility this is a good time for those who want to make a quick profit you have to bear in mind that the three witches are not only a chance to get rich there is also the likelihood of large losses being achieved the day of the three witches rollover on witches day investors who wish to hold their position in a given contract or other expiring financial instrument must change their position from an old expiring contract to a new one this is done by closing a position on an owned contract and opening the same position on a new one with a maturity of three months this is called position rollover if this does not happen the contract is settled in cash rollover does not only apply to market traders the day of the three witches is also of great importance for the cfd contract of difference market ie people speculating on oil or gold the value of almost all cfds is based on the value of the futures contracts some traders roll over their contracts the day before to avoid the fluctuations that occur on three witches day the day of the three witches on the stock exchange the day of the three witches is very important on the stock market investors who have significant open positions in derivatives attempt to influence the prices at which they will be settled for this purpose they sell or purchase the given securities on the cash market some stock market participants may have conflicting interests while some investors try to keep the price as low as possible others aim to push it to the highest levels this is where you will notice the emergence of large buying and selling deals this has various effects such as high trading volume or significantly increased volatility it can be concluded that the increased volatility in the three witches day is related to the use of the market structure by investors to achieve the highest possible profit this effect is more clearly visible on foreign markets where the range of instruments is much larger due to liquidity the day of the three witches importance for investors many investors who are just starting out in the stock market wonder why the day of the three witches is so important the increased volatility that occurs on the third friday of each quarter is the result of stock exchange players trying hard to influence the prices of instruments quotations have a huge impact on how investors behave when the demand for a given instrument grows its price also increases this is assuming that the supply does not change the opposite happens when the demand for a given exchange product decreases lack of interest is quickly reflected in a drop in price the day of the three witches is particularly important for investors with considerable capital in their case even small fluctuations in the price of a given exchange product can have a strong influence on the final results on the other hand investors who have large capital are responsible for the increased volatility in the market the day of the three witches summary the futures maturity date the socalled three witches day can cause a lot of confusion on the market the aboveaverage volatility as well as the amount of open positions and cash involved lead to movements of up to several percent all this happens only in the last hour of trading known as the three witches hour on the three witch day volatility occurs in the spot market as well as in derivatives stocks indices and the commodities market investors commit huge resources to influence the clearing price and act to their advantage

supreme court rules in apple s favor in epic games appeal in the ongoing legal battle between epic games and apple the supreme court has ruled in favor of apple allowing the tech giant to maintain its app store payment rules for now this decision is a temporary win for apple as the lawsuit continues to unfold currently companies selling apps on the app store are charged a percentage of the sale price 15 to 30 for using the platform epic along with others like spotify claimed this practice was unfair while apple largely won the suit and wasn t found guilty of anticompetitive behavior the judge did mandate that apple s antisteering rules be lifted this meant that companies should be allowed to guide users to their own sites for purchases or subscriptions potentially offering lower prices than on the app store the ninth circuit upheld this ruling but paused its implementation allowing apple to appeal to the supreme court the recent win for apple results from the supreme court s decision not to expedite the implementation of the antisteering rules justice kagan rejected epic s plea to have the rules enforced immediately granting apple more time this victory isn t definitive though as the legal battle is far from over the implications of this case are significant beyond the us the eu is also pressuring apple to revise its app store rules to allow thirdparty developers to offer alternative payment methods the outcome could impact not only apple s app store revenue but also set a precedent for other video game companies to offer alternate purchasing options potentially affecting apple s bottom line in conclusion while apple has scored a small victory in the ongoing legal saga with epic games the larger implications and potential changes to app store rules are still to be determined the battle is far from its final stages and its outcome could have farreaching consequences for the app and gaming industry summarized by chatgpt siri s 100000x better version source x200b
discussion hello everyone my first post here to anyone unaware supermicro computer inc smci has recently tanked 10 despite it having significant growth potential in my opinion this drop follows an analysis from spruce point capital that have taken a short position on the asset i personally believe this is an overreaction and smci is well poised to capitalise on projected growth in the server and electronic hardware market i believe that whether you agree with spruce point or not there is potential to profit here smci has historically outperformed earnings expectations by a relatively significant margin there is essentially a lot riding on these earnings i believe that positive earnings will likely provide a catalyst for the share price of smci to reflect its growth potential much higher than is implied by current price in my opinion whilst a negative earnings report will likely fortify the bearish sentiment that resulted from spruce point s report and cause a further selloff if you like me believe smci has growth potential disproportionate to its share price i recommend the following my strategy to take advantage of the smci s value given the timing of earnings coming up at the end of the month would be to sell credit spreads on smci prior to earnings to capitalise on potential iv crush i encourage you to read up on spruce point s analysis and make your mind up if you agree that smci is threatened sell call spreads if you believe spruce point have missed something sell put spreads regardless ensure they have an expiry date relatively far into the future this way if earnings move in your favour you profit through both iv crush decreasing the value of your sold spread and the spread moving out of the money furthermore if earnings move against you iv crush s effect on the value of your sold spread with soften the blow of your position moving against you you additionally have more time for your position to move into the money regardless of your sentiment on smci please let me know if i have missed anything
which market moves do you expect from the fomc statementconference today the market thinks a 75bps rate hike is more likely 85 5 to be announced i personally don t see a 50bps rate hike likely because of the following three reasons 1 core cpi is still high and inflation seems to be sticky 2 unemployment in the us is pretty low 3 risk assets have rallied during the last weeks this three reasons gives the fed the right to stay hawkish imo i think the dollar will rally at 200pm except the rate hike is only 50bps and it might be only a bart pattern again like at the last one in september what are your thoughts on this do you trade this

nvda ddhopiumramblingsthoughtsprayerssynopsisbedtime reading nvda is trading at 69420x earnings etc etc etc boomer talk counter point the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent also boomer talk lots of people saying that unless nvidia blows the roof off in their next er then they re gonna crater well i think they are gonna blow the roof off again bull case dario amodei the ceo of anthropic probably 3rd biggest ai lab rn behind openai and google deepmind mentioned on a podcast this week that people were still wildly underestimating the scale that ai models and subsequently industrial sized data centers are going to reach very soon these data centres are pretty much exclusively powered by nvidia gpu s 13530 also says that more and more money is entering the field 3340 he expects the price you spend on training these models to go up by a factor of 100 or something 3350 hyperbole probably but for the sake of argument gpt4 cost roughly $100m to train x100 $10bn just to train 1 model now not all of that budget is going on gpu s but a significant proportion of it will be and that s just one model from one company i can t find the link right now but ceo of stability ai emad mostaque has said he s heard of h100 orders in the 7080 000 region think it was in a twitter reply a couple weeks ago the guys a bit of a bullshitter so possibly not too trustable each h100 costs about $40 000 that s a lot of zeroes 32bn even relatively small scale co inflection ai is putting together a 22 000 h100 cluster 880m as the us is now clamping down on chip sales to china the big tech co s over there are rushing to snap up any and all nvidia gpu s they can get making orders of 5bn or more stockpiling as many as possible before export controls note this is only for older models such as a800s as newer gpu s can t be shipped to china due to export controls already however the article does state that both tencent and alibaba have received thousands of h100 and h800 gpu s to use in serverscloud outside of china this article was posted aug 9th so i m unsure if this 5bn would be factored in to nvda s previous revenue projection if it isn t and they meet their 11bn projection with this on top then they ve got a beat of nearly 50 already google deepmind has been training their new frontier model gemini since at least their io conference in may openai haven t yet begun training gpt5 though they almost certainly will have ordered sufficient compute to do so gpt4 was estimated to be trained on 16 000 a100 s i would expect them to blow this out of the water for gpt5 at least twice as much as inflections 22k h100 anthropic have claude next in the pipeline and have committed to spending up to 5bn in the next 18 or so months to compete with the big boys though this article also states 5bn over 2 years and 1bn in 18 months it does mention that they rely on clusters of 10 s of thousand gpu s already with that in mind we can assume that microsoftopenai and googledeepmind will be spending similar if not more the prize of agi would net these companies untold roi dropping hundreds of millions on compute is a no brainer cathie wood sold 10 000 shares of nvda on thursday 10th inverse cache wood soros bought 10 000 nvda 10 000 msft and 250 000 amd all ai plays nation states investing in compute power britain allocating 900m to build a supercomputer you can be sure that other countries are following suit but perhaps being less loud about it counter point is govt budgets are usually unreliable nvidia is using ai to help design their upcoming chips this feedback loop should keep them as the incumbent and increase their lead over competitors exponentially all the other companies that need to train proprietary models etc such as pltr are going to be running nvidia gpu s or going to data centres that are running them huangs insane revenue forecast is so ballsy that it has to be true i d actually have less faith if they projected something lower paradoxically this blog posits that there should be in the region of 432k h100 orders or 15bn worth of gpu s without factoring in nation states or chinese orders of a800h800 s i m not sure on the reliability but there s a lot of citations and off the record quotes interesting reading note that the author estimates about 8bn in data centre revenue for mayjuly which is a lot less than the 15bn of total orders so presumably some are being staggered over time at that level you re getting close to the 11bn revenue estimate anyway the mean 1 year forecast from 42 analysts is 51538 or 26 from its current price minimum forecast 392 and max forecast a cool $1000 today morgan stanley reiterates it s bullish position expects nvda to beat earnings by 500m1bn saudi arabia and uae also buying in at least 3000 h100 s article goes on to say 550 000 h100 expected to ship this year the h100 didn t even launch until the end of march so thats 22bn of revenue over 3 quarters not 4 this is just the thin end of the wedge a handful of nations that we know about it s not ridiculous to assume that many other nations are scooping up these resources and are doing so in less conspicuous ways all this to say that nvda basically holds the keys to the kingdom rn in this race if you aren t first your last that means amd intel are btfo bear case i think the biggest issue rn is that nvidia is bottlenecked by companies like tmsc for components nvda likely cant fulfil demand and is leaving cash on the table i would honestly say to them to raise their prices because they could pretty much charge what they want and still have buyers lining up ai isn t the new shiny toy on the block anymore and is slightly out of vogue every swinging dick in the sp 500 is shoe horning it into their products whether it fits or not which sort of devalues the brand such as it is tech as a sector feels kinda exhausted rn nvda has just had its biggest weekly fall in 11 months if it keeps slipping there s a big gap it can fall into from prior earnings i m looking to full port if it crosses 400 fml i overslept this morning and missed my entry the price is still up bigly already it is trading at a v high pe it has increasing debt the last few quarters if govt regulation on ai starts to fire up in a big way eg limiting training runs to certain amounts of parameters or compute etc this could eat into nvda quite significantly it s likely the biggest labs will continue with govt backing bc nations cannot afford to fall behind in this race but smaller co s may get access to increasingly powerful levels of compute cut off more long term but google and microsoft are looking into creating their own chips going forward to wean themselves off providers google already has its tpu s but idk enough about that price movement is dependent on future projections if nvda has sold out and every buyer has their orders filled they probably aren t going to be ordering more gpu s until a new chip comes along which likely won t be until late 24 or early 25 so perhaps revenue projections could stall somewhat earnings season has been especially brutal this time round macroeconomic factors are still slightly shaky they could have great earnings but coincidentally fall on a day when a ratings agency decides to take a shit on the market who knows final bit this article draws similarities between nvda now and csco in the early 00 s the key takeaway for me was the assumption that if nvda hits $650 gaap eps then they would only be trading at 60x earnings this would take out one of the bears major points of contention fwiw my calls are usually dog shit it s easier to sit on the side and shit talk other peoples plays rip this dd to shreds pls earnings season has been very fickle so far and i ve been burned on every earnings play apart from meta i also don t know shit about fundamentals i read a balance sheet which seems primo and the price drops anyway so what s the point at least if i go broke agi will arrive and bring post scarcity with itright if it hits my pt i ll drop everything i have into shares you can get 3x leverage on ticker nvd3 if you re feeling really special though apparently these can act weird in times of volatile price action right now i don t have a position because i am an idiot and overslept this morning and missed getting a good entry praying for a small pull back tomorrow but it may be a bit too late the end

karl marx invested in meme stocks of 1800s with the invention of the stock market and the rise of modern banking bets on the future were drastically expanded in the capitalist system and became de facto the modus operandi of capital accumulation without the necessity of involving investors directly in the operation of enterprises allowing capital holders to profit from commercial prognosis like never before stock investments soon became a mass phenomenon even karl marx traded passionately on the london stock exchange bragging to his uncle lion phillips in a letter from june 1864 i have you will be a little surprised speculated partly in american funds but especially in english stocks which are springing up like mushrooms here this year for all possible and impossible stock ventures and are driven to a quite unreasonable height and then usually burst in this way i have gained over 400 and will now once the entanglement of political conditions affords greater scope start anew this kind of operation makes small demands on one s time and it s worth taking some risk in order to relieve one s enemies of their money5 some decades later in 1882 a year before his death and in another letter to his daughter eleanor marx ridiculed professional gamblers as a bunch of lunatics for believing they could trick a pure game of chance through their system however using domainspecific knowledge to relieve other speculators from their money on the stock market seemed to be another matter for him nevertheless his hedonistic traits and chronic dependence on the financial support of his family and friends suggest that he may not have had what it takes to be a professional trader his own speculative system must have failed him regularly and the above letter was surely written in one of the rare exceptions when the dopamine rush of financial gains elevated the gambling marx into delusional heights

will fed give the greatest head fake of all time and slap a 50bps this week a old timer finance guy came into my place of work this week and told me that he thinks powell ain t playin even with the positive news about the bailout and qe unite amongst the fed and the rest of the world news today this mf is hedging his bets with a 50bps rate hike this week genius or flat out stupid this man is a powell pumper and legit is a look into powells eyes and tell me he doesn t mean business kinda guy what s the vibe y all we ve gone from 25bps to possibly no rate hike to back to 25bps and now this guys thinking powell will get the pain over with now i m just drooling over my crayons but wouldn t that be something if the market pumps tomorrow on todays news and expectations of no rate hike and then the ultimate rug pull on bulls when the rate news comes in i m a pretty because we just have to acknowledge everything and yes pretty much everything is overvalued but what i think i know about the market is that they don t want anyone to win and this would be some as expected savagery

questionanyone else s price per share calculation include brokers commission i use charles schwab as my platform got a weird question was going over my gainlost report and notice the shares prices i bought at we re not correct for almost all of my stocks for example i would buy at $108 and then the total settled calculation would show $115 under price per share gainlost did a little investigating and found out that the brokers commission was being calculated into my share price does this seem right is it suppose to do that cause i feel like this would really throw off my overall share price
highlights from fed meeting j pow is now recognized as the speaker good afternoon it s nice to see everyone glad that we got our hvac fixed on time for the meeting today the temperature is a bit inflated ahem don t worry it is transitory we at the fed understand the need for swift action when it comes to inflation housing and employment given our mandate of 200 employment 2 jobs for every american as 1 can t cut it we are working hard to tackle it by rolling the economy sorry i mean the truck of options downhill as the cpi numbers trickled in we saw it print well for the smart money and fds i digress to fix the current mess we have decided to raise the interest rate wait for it by 150bps after everyone falls down from their chairs and other who have been standing all this while take those seats bet y all did not see that coming thank you and enjoy the sequel tldr in undies at wendy s
tinfoil hat case for 5 bps tomorrow the fed cannot affect inflation directly but they need to erase demand so they do what they can raise rates until the economy slows down enough for people to lose jobs and burn through savings thus reducing demand right hold this thought now look at the inflows to the short etfs like sqqq they are the highest they have ever been right on the heels of the biggest influx of retail investment boom following gme how many billions of retail investments are sitting in short positions is there a better or faster way to erase a huge portion of the rabbles wealth then a last minute reversal when everyone is balls deep in short positions this is not financial advice i m just high

shorting biopharmaceutical strategy biopharmaceutical catalyst options strategy i saw a youtube video where a guy shorted a smallcap biopharmaceutical company right before it had its stage 3 trial results released his basis of reason was that a majority of smallcap pharmaceutical companies have a lot of funding and a lot of potential but usually fall short of creating a drug that is efficacious enough to actually be released in the market for example the company he shorted was creating a pill that blocks serotonin receptors to decrease the desire to drink alcohol in heavy drinkers the trials showed that the pill indeed did decrease the consumption of alcohol but also had a series of hormonal side effects that come with blocking serotonin reception in the brain so even though the drug worked it was not good enough to be a treatment and the stock plummeted netting him a very hefty profit he used to identify and obtain dd on pharmaceutical companies with upcoming catalysts this website not only provides the date of when the trial results will be released but also the results of previous trials and about everything you need to know about that company you can use it for free but it will only show you catalysts a few days ahead of time which isn t enough to track companies through their trials and do proper dd there is a 1month free subscription but after that it is 5 dollars a month which is very cheap for such exclusive and powerful information the fundamental logic of the strategy is solid small cap biopharmaceutical companies do not make it through the fda dramatically more often than not and stage 3 trial results are usually a letdown that is our edge we focus on stage 3 trial results because stage 3 trials appear to be the most important stage in finding out whether or not a drug works and is marketable we focus on smallcap companies because they usually have a lot more riding on a single drug compared to a largecap or midcap biopharmaceutical company a large company worth tens of billions usually has multiple drugs being developed at once and more resources which equals a higher chance of success in the event of a failed drug for a large cap the overall effect on the company will not be that large however in the event of a failed drug in a small cap where it is the only drug or 1 out of 3 drugs being developed it is a devastating loss this devastating loss is what causes the large 40 downside movements now that we have established a fundamental concept and edge we have to look at position sizing and risk management to have a profitable strategy the problem with shorting shares is that we have limited downside potential100 and unlimited upside potential while you might make 50 on 810 of the companies you short you will lose well over 100 on the 210 this will not only wipe out your gains but most likely put you in the hole since successful biopharmaceutical companies have been known to exceed 1000 upsides if their drug is approved or effective the solution to this is options we can create defined risk put debit spreads this gives you a defined upside and a defined downside the risk vs reward ratio can be determined by adjusting how far otm you buy your spread if you buy the spread atm or slightly otm you will be looking at a 11 risk to reward if you go 20 otm you ll look at a 13 risk to reward if you go 40 otm you ll usually see a 6101 risk to reward this is based on a 7dte spread theoretically if we purchased 1015 otm put debit spreads for a 21 risk to reward and 610 of our picks did not pass trials we are looking at 800$ of net profit if we bet 100$ each time however there is a problem because not all smallcap biopharmaceutical companies have options chains unfortunately we can t do anything about this and will have to pass them by unless you are willing to get otcoverthecounter options i have not messed with otc options so i cannot comment on them the other problem is that the smallcaps that do have option chains usually have very low liquidity and very few strikes to choose from this means that you will usually have to hold your spread till expiration and have the buying power to let them be exercised or the closest to the money spread that you can purchase is too far out of the money to be in accordance with what will give you a reasonably high chance of success the solution to the latter problem is a zebra or zero extrinsic value back ratio spread here is a link to explain it in depth the zebra allows you to mimic owning 100 shares of stock for approximately 50 of the cost and removes all extrinsic value from the spread this gives you a builtin stop loss at 50 of what it cost to own 100 shares of the stock and for every 1 dollar the stock goes up you will make 100 dollars while this spread requires a larger financial commitment it can be done on basically any options chain and you can sell for max profit at any time you do not have to wait until expiration unlike a debit spread x200b this is all i have put together for this strategy so far i am excited to test it out i am not experienced or knowledgeable in the biopharmaceutical sector whatsoever so i wanted to share the information i ve collected and ask this subreddit if they have any insights they could share with me most specifically what catalysts are most important to look at while stage 3 trials are pivotal i am curious if anyone knows if there was a better catalyst to be against on aside from stage 3 thank you
how would alien disclosure benefit or hurt certain industries in the stock market all hypothetical here i don t expect them to admit anything for the next 5 years anyways but further down the road when they do because they will what stocks could boom and what stocks could bust or the most likely scenario everything totally collapses how to prepare if this happens not sure if this will even post because i never post on reddit but i ve been trading a lot of $dpst and made a lot of money $500 i m a noob but this question hasn t been asked yet

my loss today and advice for others this is not to illicit sympathy as i deserve none on this i took some bad losses by not being able to close out a put yesterday afternoon due to bad wi fi and got stuck holding a nvda put into this morning immediately it was at a severe loss so i took my other plays and tried converting them over to higher outs to cover and try and make up my losses i ignored every rule of this i chased losses down i liquidated long term options to try and recoup with 0 day expirations i held to the bitter end instead of preserving capitol trust me this is a person who knew what he was doing and just ignored it trying to make it all back quickly it s pretty obvious gambling problem so after the multiple times i said i m done i actually closed my account today pretty much didn t have the choice with no capitol left to invest what i m going to focus on is working on other stuff including my addiction i did take the last few dollars and put them in powerball to make it a cleansweep wipeout of funds i look forward to not waking up early for the market or stressing out over options held overnight anymore and relentlessly following every board and investment site in a way it s sort of freeing i know when i am not distracted by this i end up working harder in other parts of my life so it may be a blessing in disguise i have faith that this is a better path for me i have my faith that god has something better for me long term and if not then i take pride knowing that some people s lives are meant as an examplewarning to others on what not to do if that is my role in lifeso be it my advice to others don t compound losses if you lost on something take a step back don t try to double down or increase your exposure trying to minimize a loss stick to your plan i sure didn t and paid the price when it s quickly changing prices it s sometimes a panic moment of throwing your game plan out the window take a break for a day it s interesting and sometimes fun to do this but it eats up a lot of time you don t have to make plays everyday most retail traders lose on options it s just the number of statistics and time there are very few that can make real money doing it and it requires discipline to do so if you aren t one of those people maybe this isn t for you yes this is gambling if you are doing options don t try to convince yourself otherwise this does have technical aspects of it that are skill and learning but it is a large part of gambling on this as all the research in the world won t overcome mms who prop up stocks or manipulate prices there is so much manipulation on options to make sure you don t cash in big it s why we have terms like max pain because they are trying to maximize their gains the house eventually always wins it s very corrupt there is unlimited money going against you the retail trader they can artificially hold up a stock price until options expire or manipulate stock issuances they are billionaires predators and you are their prey they didn t get rich by having morals or fair play in their portfolio and they have unlimited resources to screw you over you can complain all you want but there is nothing you can do about it you chose to play their game and it s game rigged against you but as long as you choose to play you are the one deciding your future can t complain about it if you knowingly participate for every winner there are two losers your winnings didn t come artificially in a vacuum someone has to lose for your gains so be careful who you rub it into at the very least if one person takes a small amount of advice from this and makes some corrections in their own life for the better then my loss definitely was worth it then thank you all and i wish you good fortunes in this or whatever you do

tgt as bullish tgt has lost 10b in market share in a little over a week strictly from bad press and not because of financial mismanagement it has a 3 div rate of$106 per quarter 77 held by institution i think it will bounce back as the media storm blows over and has a $20 spring back capacity by 4th quarter thoughts edit before you ape in the sink has not stopped several commentators have brought up good points like the anti shopping movements calling for a total boycott on june the best buy sign will be the firing of the ceo then ape in as it will turn bullish afterwards if they go through with their fall lineup of continued gender neutral winter wear it will crush their 4th quarter sales as black friday will be less profitable always invest what your willing to lose aside from this the long hold dividend is still nice for you diamond hands but be cautious if you are expecting short term 3rd4th quarter gains

calibrating a long volatility trade for tlry earnings this week i looked at tlry as a possible play for their earnings releasing monday before market open my usual approach is to start by comparing the stock move on past earnings versus current expected move then look at some positions past earnings moves a good first step is to start by looking at past earnings moves for the stock let s start with the main numbers average post move 137 std deviation 69 standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of values a quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this and as high as average plus this tlry moves between 68 and 206 on its earnings we can refine these numbers by looking at the breakdown of these past moves every line is a past earnings of tlry showing data about that release date we see the average and standard deviation calculated on those date we can assess that 13 average and 7 std dev stayed grew over the last two years from around 10 for every date we have the prerelease dayofrelease postrelease actual moves this time not absolute pre post moves are highest recorded move leading to after the release by one day for example for 20221007 the prerelease move of 37 is the highest move recorded between the 05th and 06th 204 between the 06th a day before release to 07th day of release and the 99 between the 07th and 08th highlighted rows are dates where the move on day of release exceeded the past average value we see since 2018 the lowest move recorded was 315 on 20210728 we can assess if these dates correspond to perhaps other events that pushed those moves as outliers or whether the stock is more unpredictable on when its spikes on earnings a good way of investigating this is looking at histograms charts this a distribution of the past moves we were looking at the x axis is the value of the move and the y axis is how many it occurred so spikes correspond to the highest occurrences most historic moves are concentrated between 17 and 15 with however occurrence of the big peak at 31 and overall a very volatile stock on earnings given these informations we can start looking at possible plays for betting on the stock moving higher than the past average of 13 one thing to always keep in mind is the iv crush implied volatility rises in the days leading to the earnings release which makes holding options positions through earnings risky where iv drops significantly right after the release inflicting a high loss on long options positions if the stock price does not exceed the implied move stock price at the time of this writeup is 295$ near close wednesday january 05th so closest strikes are the 25$ and 3$ for the closest expiration of 0113 position tlry 0113 3p 3c link to position we see the straddle is showing a small delta of 009 and a gamma of 016 this position is nondirectional meaning it gets affected in the same way wether the stock moves up or down gamma shows us how fast that reaction is breakeven 12 147 worst case scenario of no stock move will yield a 38 loss however in our early analysis we found that tlry moves on average 72 around its earnings so this makes this position quite well positioned to profit from the stock exceeding the average move we can better estimate maximum profit and loss for 7 stock move minimum historic move calculated from the average and std dev above the position will not breakeven but loses around 30 this position is nondirectional so wether the stock moves x or x doesn t change much in our analysis our breakeven is not quite centered so at average historic move we will breakeven if it s a downtrend move and still lose if it s an uptrend move for the realistic maximum historic move 20 calculated from the average and standard dev numbers above the potential gain is 34 max potential profit 40 max potential loss 40 this can be used to calibrate stoploss and takeprofit thresholds with some margin aggressive willing to hold for maximum move even through no move at the beginning takeprofit 30 stoploss 50 mild happy with just an average past move and cutting it if the move is a bit over the minimum takeprofit 20 stoploss 20 a good practice is to not activate the stop less in the first hour to give the market time to react then we either exit at stop loss or take profit x200b hope this is helpful lemme know if you have any questions
a tin foil hat for bbby hear me out on this ryan cohen posted a series of tweets back in jan or february with the images of shorts and a black flag then a purple heart later on what if the short squeeze didnt have anything to do with what people thought it was then due to a merger or acquisition of bbby was actually finalizing in agreement what if it was just him saying hey guys look things are about to happen and one fateful day there was a post about his actual involvement i am just saying that the media wouldnt pump so hard if there wasn t enough stake to be lost they tried killing it before it became a thing and then all of the bots came out to play crazy enough it actually could be a thing this separates any of the current fud thats coming around and directly relates to an option no one talked about what if the short squeeze was in fact due to a merger and not a spin off it makes sense with his background for rc to do this he fought head on with amazon building chewy what if his master plan actually is to build another amazon jeff bezos is not the one all say all and amazon is great but there s more that could be done amazon is quite diversified and the segment that has been lacking has been the update for the selling and buying interface amc could have been a key player if they took a look and actually was able to provide the web streaming of movies or other possible avenues give it like amazon prime video game stop and bbby are avenues for selling products thinking outside of the box ryan cohen s master plan is to build a different type of amazon using the failing brick and mortar companies that will be acquired to form a conglomerate to battle the likes of amazon rd ventures would be smart to play the activist role to do this this isnt the first time it s happened and i think this is the game plan amazon has aws which is a bigger focus for bezos than the rest of the company no one at this time has thought about it this way or posted it at least how do you combat a billion dollar company fast you dont start small and hope it grows to be it you take value and merge that value to be a contender as long as you have the capital to do it rc is a billionaire running under the guise of activist because the best way to pick up these companies is to acquire on the cheap and bring the little man to rally with it building name recognition and loyalty thank you for coming to my ted talks next we just need gary vaynercheck to jump on board with talking about it and the midas touch will begin everything everybody wanted elon to be edit auto correct sucks

you don t call the bottom of a decade long bubble you re not a disconnected hyperrational being that is some sort of purely neutral observer of markets you re an 85 iq internet addicted permavirgin that has lost your ability to focus more than 30 seconds without getting angry your instincts for trading were forged and trained in a total economic anomaly you know absolutely nothing about trading about markets about investing about anything really you think buying the dip is some sort of revolutionary strategy that you ve discovered it s like a lab rat that always manages to find the cheese at the end of the maze being let loose in the wild the rat would find its way into a cave and run until it starved to death there s no cheese at the end of the maze there s no pump after you buy the dip all there is waiting for you is endless suffering your newfound interest in investing was not something that came to you as an intellectual interest it began occupying your brain space for the same reason you get an urge to eat oreo cookies or those cheetos you ve got stuffed under your bed frame you re an idiot driven purely by emotion that got sucked into the greatest asset bubble the world has ever seen asset bubbles are driven by the induced psychology of all its participants you think you re in charge of your emotions because you ve never known what it s like to have an independent thought in your entire life you can t call the bottom you won t call the bottom the bottom is when the asset bubble has deflated to a point that you ve taken your own life if you re calling the bottom it means the bottom isn t even close

how to optimize your yolo when you have no clue how squeezy it s gonna get i m trying to figure out how to optimize my long call strategy for situations where i m superduper bullish but have no idea how high the value might spike scenario 2 in my fancy graphs below drawn in ms paint for your pleasure lol my intuition says buy otm calls with a range of strike prices allocating less money to the very high strike price calls does this strategy have a name would this strategy have a materially different riskreturn profile from just picking a single strike price somewhere in the middle i m especially interested in longdated options for what it s worth thanks in advance for the brainfolds

2008 vs now algos are what does the trading everything is decided by algorithms pre setup by humans those humans have emotions and they often kick in under similar situations thus adding to the predictability of human behavior and crowd movements algos are no different as they are simply created by humans with the same predictable traits this makes the algos predictable earnings hit x number and guidance is x number theres an algo for that the fed announces a hike or decline theres an algo for that cpi the war in ukraine oil the 10 year even cnbc when someone gets up there saying certain bullish things or bearish things spy magically just so happens to move in that direction i wouldn t be surprised if algos scan this 123m member sub and daily chats they will probably read this post and pull stuff from it and how ya ll react so on and so forth algos for every scenario you can think of the presets are ready to roll out so if the algos are predictable we don t have to lose a dime anymore because big whale guy with the algos can simply make that move for you and move the market for you all you need to know is if the big money is actually bought into a rally or decline from time to time i notice a specific person declares they are shorting the bear market rally magically over the coming days the market comes down how did he know are they a genius no they just use the same algos that probably every hedge fund in america paid some salesman 1 million dollars for so heres some cool data i looked at all the major bear rallies we had this year and compared them to our most recent low these are all from the lowest intraday low to the highest intra day high i m going to add fed meeting dates and cpi dates that occurred all this year as well so you essentially have a calendar to backtest note your starting date is a low so you can look at the previous end date as the high that is your top to bottom period for example 02020224 is a high to low i will also add in the expected jump from our lowest low you can surmise what patterns you will and i ll give my thoughts after lowest low 36217 4 trading days have passed with the 5th on monday 0112 cpi data comes in

400 and your average trading days are 1267 or call it 13 days scary boooooooooo trading days trough to peak were as short as 5 trading days and as long as 29 trading days from today that would give you dates of 06270804 you might be asking snippy why the hell are you giving me such a ridiculous range i cant do anything with that ohhhhhhh but you can child here is the 20072008 data on spy minus the bls fed stuff because i m too lazy to go find it although i wouldn t be surprised if the algos have that data too 11261211 11 trading days 869 rally 01220201 8 trading days 1080 rally 03170519 46

might be thinking comon man this isn t 2008 all over again well just look at people you know and see every day are they flush with a bunch of cash and no debt are they going out every weekend and running up the bar or got a bunch of trips planned for this year 2008 cracked from unemployment as the last shoe to drop so of course its hard to see it today but the fed is literally on record stating they need higher unemployment to kill inflation i the fed some kind of a magical future predicting machine no its not why are people predicting 20 rallies well they happened before the algo can pull up this data and say yep 20 rally on the way it took 6 bear market rallies over the course of over 1 full calendar year to bring the absolute bottom in some of those rallies were massive rallies over 26 being one of them so seeing the market rally 20 over the next x trading days does not matter its just an opportunity to make money the smart money shorted the strength of these rallies and also the smart money bought into the rallies bears make money bulls make money and pigs me today get slaughtered the 2008 rally by comparison was from 346 trading days the last thing i would like to cover is news its entirely possible the current data is well lets say cooked it happened back in 08 just so the banks could hedge the decline themselves they took that nice lil 14 rally in may and probably shorted tf out of everything thus the downtrend someday a headline will read war in ukraine over or inflation has peaked these are turn around headlines you cannot squander and should remember and even bet on because they will inevitably occur but one thing about us i don t know about you but everything around me is certainly higher than just 8 this is where consumers do have the edge is you know what your paying at the pump and the grocery store some hedge fund guy has no idea the impact paying another dollar at the pump has ourselves as retail actually have a massive advantage because we know the data before it even comes out because we live it everyday this is not a post to predict spy will hit x price by x date but if you believe as i do that things are in a general down trend that will only go lower or even even think i m full of it and 100 wrong you need to be aware of just how long the bulls and bears were winning and how much we can easily do a nice 15 run in 2 months just to finish the next 6 months down overall 35 or 40 dont be a trigger happy bear on a 2 rally off a considerable drop don t be a trigger happy bull after we get a 7 or 8 rally from a considerable drop cap them profits it s not being right 100 of the time its about aggressively cutting losses when they even start to show up tldr everyone here knows the inflation data before its out by living it out and spy has predictable price patterns based on algorithms some dude made with the same fear and excitement as the rest of us they feel what you feel and it pays to go against what most people feel

11023 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis twas the eve of the eve of cpi and all through the markets not a bull nor a bear was willing to make a move while ole daddy jpow spoke despite their being not a whisper in the markets there could not be a crisper morning of volatility with a flat afternoon we just knew that the bulls would attempt to retake 3901 with a key level being retaken it only makes sense that the bulls would not be forsaken again x200b the fake out appears as of now to be nothing more than a retest of support before we push forward despite yesterdays clear rejection of 3901 we actually managed to find support here at the daily 20ema which also happens to be the previous resistance now support area that we consolidated in for the last 3 weeks with bulls making a breakout back over key 3901 and bullishly engulfing on the daily candle with that nice daily 20ema support bounce this should see a bigger push up now this is actually the first time we have had two candles closed over the daily 20ema since december cpi if we get a third that is a very bullish omen for the markets and we are actually very close to a bullish 820ema crossover on the daily with cpi estimates minus cleveland fed being lowered yet again today i still lean for a bullish thursday which will put us back in that previous 3942 to 4025 consolidation area by eow however the question is what will tomorrow bring we have no data economic wise and we also have no speakers tomorrow as of now that i can see the day before cpi can go either way some cpis we get a pretty impressive sell off leading into it much like november and then other cpis we get a huge rally into it much like december cpi the technical would favor a bullish day tomorrow but the technical yesterday also favored a bearish day and yet here we are key support 3901 3878 3863 key resistance 3916 3942 x200b futures daily actually looks even more bullish than spys daily we had the similar bullish engulfing candle on futes and we also managed to bounce off the daily 8 and daily 20ema we might actually get our bullish crossover there tomorrow which has not happened since october with a close over the daily 8 20 and 50ema we should begin to think about the daily 200ema which is near 4000 currently we also are seeing that futures did close back in the december consolidation channel of 3935 to 4035 key support 3935 3920 3895 key resistance 3966 4000 x200b tesla remains in this clear consolidation channel with another rejection off the 123 resistance area this time though it came down and retest support of the daily 8ema and closed over 1185 support with a failure to lose the daily 8ema and the possible double bottom off 1185 i favor upside for tesla tomorrow but it needs to take out that 123 resistance level tomorrow if it can take that out and close over that with the help of a bullish cpi we very well might find tesla on a push for its daily 20ema key support 1185 1132 key resistance 1232 1264 daily log x200b swang some tesla puts overnight that amazingly were not that red at open despite about a 1 open on tesla closed those out asap from there i had a really great morning of trading on spy with that heavy volatility took a tesla play that unfortunately put me in the red and with two back to back stop losses on l2l plays on spy ended up with a small red day today tesla finds itself back on the naughty list outside of a swing play every now and then that put play would have been up an easy 20 but it hit my stop loss before i could ever see profits the eod price action after we broke through 3885 was so weak and we were so close to 3901 that i missed the uptrend and wasn t able to capitalize on that for gains was fairly tempted to swing a tesla or spy call but decided to sit cash instead
is the cma regarded for blocking atvi last november the uk s competition and markets authority cma launched an antitrust investigation against apple and google to curb their dominance in the cloud gaming industry so apparently everyone is so dominant in the cloud gaming industry they all need to be blocked or does the cma just define cloud gaming however they feel like in the morning why is everyone in government so regarded
112122 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis that was probably one of the worst days to trade that i have seen in months the volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched i had extreme flash backs to june and july where spy was so irrational it was untradeable the pretty extreme low volume we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year made for even harder trading today x200b this is where things continue to perplex me and i continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say look at this years cpi yoy forecasts and actual readings since july 13th we have not had a single increase in cpi yoy we have also not had a single cpi yoy forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting now we look at core cpi yoy and from august until october core was rising however last reading core decreased again so we have the fed and mind you they ve been saying inflation is not under control since at least july maybe august but we are seeing inflation slowing not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal but with cpi yoy decreasing and core ranging from 59 to 66 with most of it being 59 to 63 i feel like there i just something the fed isn t telling us or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound i mean think about jpow last fomc what did he tell us we was very clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature which means that almost all the fed members and even jpow himself knows inflation isn t under control this next cpi and fomc meeting will be very interesting to say the least the case for a huge cpi miss is growing by the minute for me however we don t have any consensus yet investingcom says forecast but that really the consensus there is a teforecast out but i find that inaccurate there is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until cpi and fomc which then perhaps cpi misses and fomc remains bearish and we see this drop hard wednesday is fomc minute day and we should get some more information from jpow and what the fed members are thinking there i will release the fomc minute trade play to the premarket section tonight x200b last week i brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in however we are still showing bullish enough moves here to not short this the bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today that was interesting we are still holding that daily 8ema that support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 3947 to 3985 now mind you i really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 3985 and actually touch that resistance but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range we closed yet again another doji on spy too i am eyeing a possible carrot top blue lines formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema while we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it the issue we have here is this buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25 of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls while we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before cpi fomc i feel like no one wants to go long here on calls however sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early bears aren t ready to hard sell and bulls don t want to keep buying so we are left with this terrible chop key support 3947 3901 key resistance3985 4013 x200b futures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance looking at futures i actually see a clearer trend than i do on spy x200b i removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear there is a nice diamond pattern forming here on futures this pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down this pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005 x200b out of curiosity i went back to spy and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one support at 394 and resistance at 3978 for tomorrow back to futures now key support 3960 3925 3910 key resistance 4000 4028 x200b zooming out here first to show you the tesla daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them focus on the bold dark green line here x200b now looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel this green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel we are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in december interestingly enough about tesla here is we have a red falling wedge a red black falling wedge and a blue red falling wedge now people have been calling for a bounce since 2048 and since the 234 rejection back on november 1st this is where i struggle as it just seems tesla cant quite catch a break had a bad news day on friday and then again today recalls i guess the question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go or is this the easiest short of 2022 i want to look at some trends on tesla as i like numbers so lets go back to the september 21st top sept 21st 5 day drop 1383 followed by 2 day pop 685 sept 28th 5 day drop 166 followed by 1 day pop of 69 oct 4th 10 day drop 207 followed by 4 day pop of 126 oct 18th 6 day drop 132 followed by 8 day pop of 194 nov 1st 8 day drop 254 followed by 6 day pop of 133 nov 15th current drop 6 day drop 166 followed by a average of days for the drop 666 days including current drop or 68 without current drop average for the drop 177 including current drop or 1794 without current drop average of days for the pop 42 days average for the pop 1181 so what does this tell us well being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 11 from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we could see a recovery this also shows that we could analytically see from here at this 16754 low today see a 1181 pop over 45 days which gets tesla back to about 1873 by monday the 28th or tuesday that 29th looking at teslas charts there is a key resistance area formed from 1852 to 1868 i also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject this also would line up if this happened before november 29th a perfect falling wedge resistance rejection at the 1868 level this could be a great place to short tesla again of course assuming tesla does bounce from here x200b there was a nice support line on the vix from the august peak to the current peak on spy the vix just broke through that support today though looking at spy you wouldn t have noticed that the vix for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 223 level for the first time since august 26th which was jackson hole has spy looking pretty weak lets just compare so the last two times the vix was here was august 26th and then november 11th the hod from those days was 39935 on november 11th and 41996 for august 26th that means spy is about $5 lower than the november high and about $20 lower than the august high does this mean we are about to see a push up i would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way vold came out and dumped almost all morning to be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks $5k 10 challenge x200b daily log x200b really tough trading day for me today swung some tesla calls of course they caught a bad news day again was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover opened about 40 and saw tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance was looking good think i saw about 25 then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above from there i just couldn t see to time anything correctly and the ones i did time today didn t pay it was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as i expected it to do and struggling to even get 5 profits however of course if i was wrong it took those gains away no issue though theta once again won today a red day for me which isn t the end of the world it does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then thursday markets closed and friday is a half day however days like today teach me important lessons what are those lessons 1 no matter how choppy the market is never break your rules there was a few times today where i could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that i was correct i thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money 2 not every day is a tradeable day for me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt lost about 2 today out of this account its not a huge deal to trade these days but for those of you with smaller ports or where every dollar counts on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly if the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off there is nothing wrong with that the beauty of this there will always be another day week month year etc to trade however we will not always have the money to trade anyone who doesn t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back of course there is a lot of money to be made in a bear market but what there also is is a lot of money to lose and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don t protect your capital people really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports i highly recommend it while you are learning there really is not consciousable reason you have to trade with real money in the beginning personally i think 90 of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital after their safety net to be able to trade this market better and more strategically its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with long story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market protect your capital live to trade another day take profits when you have them do not be greedy youtube will be up later reminder i will not be trading tomorrow so no premarket tomorrow morning and i wont be trading at all tomorrow busy day with the kids and some other appointments
how tf is edu still up they missed earnings expectations big time $094 vs $003 expected and revenue was slightly off as well apart from pivoting koolearn towards livestream events and rolling out nonacademic tutoring business study tour and research camps edu s business model still remains more or less like an educational company as the revenue contribution of this from the top ten cities in china is over 60 the only reason why it s trading at this price now is cus their cash and cash equivalents from deposit and shortterm investments totaled approximately $42 billion with 1697m outstanding shares edu currently trades a dollar for a dollar this means no one is willing to even to pay a single cent more for this stock and the downside is when the ccp steps back to launch a crackdown on the educational sector or even selective companies the potential fear of such systemic risks where the government could just come in and choke the lifeline of companies will cause edu to have more downsides so until the central government decides to take their hands off private companies there s almost no way that this plays out well

lehman 20 how socgen and credit suisse will bring down the financial system socit gnrale or socgen and credit suisse hold over $25 trillion usd in assets and are two of the top banks in europe both are part of tier1 of the gsibs or globally systematic important banks alongside morgan stanley wells fargo and others just to give some perspective on size and importance the gsibs rankings were established in 2011 and mean that these banks are essentially to big to fail until they do we will start with the big picture european banks in general are under critical stress the euro is collapsing energy prices are skyrocketing and assets held within russia are largely lost forever on top of this the european central bank ecb is raising rates for the first time in over a decade let me make it clear that there was a reason europe decided to go to negative rate territory if they had not there would have been mass defaults a major recession and there would have essentially been no recovery from the financial crisis the whole euro zone would have been decimated maybe something positive would have come out of this maybe not but leaders in europe and the ecb decided to sacrifice the future for the present and unfortunately now we are in the future socgen has always had significantly risky practices ala lehman brothers in fact lehman said in january 2008 that the fraud uncovered at socgen was everyone s worst nightmare irony abounds following this socgen absorbed a bunch of exlehman staff and continued what they do best overleveraging defrauding and money laundering for the world s elite criminals this kind of business model works well when it is working but when a perfect storm hits it s an absolute fiasco credit suisse is not much different this article from february pretty much sums up everything you need to know about credit suisse as if we are living in a sick joke they named axel lehmann their head of their risk committee last year who is now their chairman unlike us banks which recovered after the financial crisis credit suisse is still down 92 from the highs and is down over 40 this year socgen has had a similar downwards trajectory now onto the perfect storm since january 2021 the euro is down 12 against the usd that may not seem like a lot but you must understand that currency markets move very slowly until something is fundamentally wrong on one side of the currency pair currency traders use significant leverage sometimes as much as 10001 to make trades and multipercent moves can cause a lot of collateral damage fastforward to 2022 and the russian invasion of ukraine credit suisse socgen and essentially every other bank in europe had significant risk exposure to russia and russian banks as they all had done business on a regular basis the sanctions that were put on russia caused significant fx volatility along with a massive spike in energy prices which both contributed to the energy inflation europe is seeing which far outpaces the us there was already some restructuring going on at credit suisse which did not help here is a table for bank comparison x200b and here is a more ominous chart x200b said bluntly credit suisse is already operating at a deficit before the ecb raises rates the ecb raising rates will cause significant loan defaults now for socgen i work with uhnw individuals and constantly price out structured products structured products are largely a game for the wealthy to ensure an income while limiting significant risk in the markets but there is always counterparty risk what this means is that banks write these structured products and the risk premium is in part determined by the ability of the counterparty bank the bank that is writing the note staying solvent when lehman was nearing the end and internal employees knew it they wrote a ton of notes such as principal protection notes that ensured investors could not lose unless lehman a prestigious bank of over 150 years went out of business fastforward to last week this hits my inbox at work a note written by socgen essentially guaranteeing a return over 20 x200b here is what was written alongside this note highest max return 3125 lowest max return 2430 underlying spx issuer soc gen strike date 616 notional $1 000 000 i have never seen a note like this hit my inbox and i have already written previously about socgen and its risky structured note behavior it is coming full circle these businesses are going to get crushed over the next three months what europe is facing is much more dire than what the united states is facing there are countries in europe that can t pay back their debt never mind businesses and consumers the ecb has to raise rates if they do not inflation will topple governments the challenge will be if the result becomes so unstable that the entire european union collapses and countries such as germany return to their own currencies sending the euro spiraling downwards there are hundreds of other data points that should be in this report and please feel free to comment with them because this is all beyond fascinating puts shorts and anything else betting against credit suisse and socgen are good plays especially over the next six months we are going to see some fireworks ladies and gentlemen

index us cap funds vs retirement funds which is better for year to year aggressive growth i have just started a job recently and they have a retirement package through fidelity i went over the package several times and i am curious about which is a better selection for me to put my aftertax funds into my retirement account are the sp 500indexus smallmid cap index a better choice for retirement planning than the target retirement funds right now through fidelity it lists that as of 09122022 sp 500 index has a 1y return of 2871 us smallmid cap index 1y return of 1251 while based on my birthday the target retirement 2065 fund 1y return is 1657 msci us broad mkt is 2610 which might be better choice than just the target retirement since it is a blend of a few things i have always had the impression that the sp 500 index is a more predictable and reliable growth for a portfolio than the basic target retirement 20xx funds which buckets would you put your money into to get more aggressive returns in the next 20 years are there other funds that i should look into to get more aggressive returns with for example the large cap equity fund such as the russell 1000

how institutions take advantage of clueless retail featuring bbai in the last couple weeks there have been a lot of posts about squeeze s for the most part all of these have been pd s that have been promoted by people who have jumped into them to try to make some quick money one of them however is particularly stupid people have been promoting bbai saying that it has a low float and the cost to borrow is about 800 as a result the stock has gone up about 100 in a month and some people think it s going to moon there is one serious flaw with the bbai thesis if you actually read the 10k and s1 forms you notice that the company has $200 million of convertible debt this debt can be converted to shares at a price of $1150 taking into account the value of the imbedded warrants in the debt it makes sense for institutions to convert the debt into shares at about $13 a share if all the debt is converted at $13 a share institutions will make about $26 million in profit so retail being stupid has pushed the price up to $1250 a share not understanding that there is a $226 million sell wall at about $13 retail has created a trade in which buying a share of bbai gives almost no upside while carrying tons of downside retail then proceeds to promote this trade if any major volume comes in at $13 a share or higher institutions will dump bbai shares on retail and retail will be stuck holding the bag in order for the price to go above $13 a share retail would need to buy $226 million in shares and continue buying that is not going to happen positions shorting bbai is expensive so i instead sold 100 1216 $5 calls this stock can t go up above about $13 a share at least not with any serious volume the company recently reported terrible earnings so positive catalysts that would drive the price above $13 a share are unlikely before this stock was meme d it traded at $5 a share also 100m insider shares get unlocked on december 7th or if the price closes above $1250 for 20 out of 30 trading days edit it has been pointed out in the comments that the s1 that was filed for the convertible debt is not effective yet hence the debt cannot be converted it was filed 2 weeks ago so it should become effective any day now so trade bbai at your own risk i will maintain my position as it is i think the riskreward is still heavily in my favor
if i hear one more soft landing can the regards at the treasury janet you fat bitch and the fed stop saying soft landing we are producing more debt than product delinquencies are rising quicker than 2008 homes are practically unaffordable for anyone making less than 100k a year companies are quietly laying people off especially in tech the top 10 stocks control the whole market almost any company involved in ai is way overvalued no matter how much weakness is hidden away it s pretty clear we are closer to a hard landing rather than soft like my dick when i see janet there s a growing number of countries entering recession china is getting killed right now and no matter how much they lie to us my eyes still work and it s driving me insane what is going to lead us to a soft landing ai rate cuts me beating off to janet never gonna happen there is nothing that looks bullish in the future other than a couple of the top tech companies despite this the market is at all time highs and somehow i m supposed to believe it s a free market only thing i see saving us is a world war and mass production of nuclear weapons it s the only way to get out of this hole or telling janet to fuck off no matter what i ll stay a gay ber and continue to lose money on puts because i believe in following my heart and my heart tells me fuck janet

contrary to popular retarded belief here there was a stock market before the dot com bubble jerome powell livedworked through it history says fuck your calls instead of pulling old reliable of presenting a beautiful chart of either the 00 dot com bubble or 08 collapse and saying we are here we will do some real dd into something actually similar to today most chungus here don t realize how eerily similar we are to the 1970s bear market that really split some hairs but before that lets give a little prelude to what happened in the late 60s that set the stage for this market saw a crash of a massive speculative market dubbed the gogo era that was created by massive investment in high risk speculative investment most notably letter stock cough spacs which was privately purchased stock that was immediately revalued and sold leading to some greasy behavior that chamath would get a hard on for with no real reporting requirements funds literally just made up ridiculous returns leading to a massive crash in 1969 version market so now we will transport back to the time of hippies acid funk disco high inflation fuel lines and fun inevitably vietnam was a massive part in my opinion driving the eventual 1974 crash instead of printing a fuckton of money to finance you getting a shimmy check to trade while locked down they were financing the attempt to kill commies just like today they over the fuck did it and removed the united states from the gold standardi m not a fucking gold bull regardless of your opinion of what has happened since then it truly is an uncharted experiment with where they have taken it fast forward a few years the vietnam war is going terribly america departs the country in march of 1973 cutting off all supplies leaving south vietnam to certain defeat which it did officially in 1975 absolutely hilarious when you compare this to afghanistan then finally under a small peace the boat is truly shaken when in october 1973 opec headed by the saudis embargoed shipments of oil to the us and other countries over their support of israel in the yomkippur war by march 1974 oil prices had risen 300 for the half of you with boomer parents ask them about the gas lines when they were kids almost every single one will remember vividly the gas shortages and prices wow this totally couldn t be similar in the fact that russia has skyrocketed oil prices by embargoing western countries over their support of ukraine in the war exasperated by the political instability caused by the nixon impeachment process beginning in 1973 the dow entered a bear market leading to massive losses for example avon products the hot growth stock of 1972 tumbled from $140 a share to $1850 by the end of 1974 cocacola shares dropped from $14975 to $4450 eventually losing 45 of its value as inflation was entrenched for the rest of the decade only being snuffed out by a brazen cigar smoking paul volcker who wasn t afraid to say fuck your calls to kill inflation guess what jerome powell worked under paul volcker so he has seen and experienced the problems of prolonged inflation and he has seen how it was killed whether or not jerome powell has the balls to go against the grain telling every government official and the public to fuck off and he will kill inflation by all means necessary or will he continue to be paper shake powell and concede as soon as things get hairy like in 2018 anyway the losses of the market and effects of inflation led to the death of the stock market by the now famous 1979 article i highly recommend you read it a summary taken from the article there are at least four good reasons why inflation is killing equities stock prices reflect anticipated corporate profits during periods of rapid inflation however profits fall because most businesses cannot raise prices quickly enough to keep up with costs even gains in profits are largely illusory because inflation makes them look rosier than they actually are and because plant and equipment are depreciated at historic cost rather than replacement price money that should go into capital investing and inventory purchasing instead goes to the government in taxes experience has taught investors that inflation will lead to an economic downturn that will wreck corporate profitability and stock prices this happened in 1974 when the worst recession since the depression followed the last burst of doubledigit inflation investors jump from stocks to bonds to nail down high rates inflation also promtps corporations to sell debt because it is taxdeductible and can be paid off in cheaper dollarsthereby reducing the flow of new stocks to market inflation adjusted return in the 1970s data source macrotrends history doesn t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme the reality is what the economy is heading into the hurricane here in a bit with maybe an eye of the storm along the way it must be noted that so to this reality is what made people extraordinarily rich buffett despite taking massive losses bought massive stakes at great prices that would rocket once inflation was killed leading to a healthy bull run in the 1980s there will be both massive opportunity both on the long and short side of things in the years to come but don t expect it to be as easy as the 20202021 retard bubble

dd here s what you re missing on the boeing safety crisis a 737 max losing a window midflight is a terrible pr disaster but on its own just that a pr disaster that will blow over however unfortunately for dave calhoun and all the ba bag holders the timing could not be worse you see ba has been trying to sneak through safety exclusions for the upcoming 737 max7 and max10 and they were about to get away with it too but now this pr disaster has awoken the sleeping giant that is american consumers just in time for them to realize that they have ba by the balls the airworthiness directive back in august the faa published a littlenoticed airworthiness directive where they state that the engine antiicing eai system on all 737 maxs can bring down the entire plane if left on for five minutes too long direct quotes the use of eai in dry air for more than five minutes during certain combinations of altitude total air temperature and n1 settings can result in engine inlet cowl temperatures exceeding design limits x200b the departure of the inlet may cause fuselage andor window damage potentially resulting in decompression and hazard to windowseated passengers aft of the wing andor impact damage to the wing flight control surfaces andor empennage which could result in loss of control of the airplane okay that s not so bad right just add some temperature sensors andor an alarm for the pilots so they can take corrective action surely that would be the faa s imposed remedy nope faa said pop a disclaimer in your manual and you re good look at this fucking shit right here we fixed it they said imagine for a single second that your car had this problem that if you left your fucking window defogger for 5 minutes too long your wheels might start popping off what would happen instant recall pull the cars into the shop fix them and of course stop making new cars until the problem if fixed ok obviously planes are different than cars and we all wanted to go home for the holidays to see grandma once more time before she kicks the can so nobody wanted to see the max fleet grounded and flights cancelled the request for safety exemption that ad was already terrible timing for boeing since they re trying hard to get the max7 certified and it has the exact same engine melting problem the next piece of the puzzle comes in last month when boeing formally petitions for their upcoming max7 to be exempt from a handful of safety regulations they want to slap the same warning in the manual and sell these puppies to southwest so you can start riding them next year they know their existing fleet of 737 max has a safety issue they won t ground them to fix them they won t stop making new max8 and max9 with the safety issue and now they want to release a new model that they know is unsafe on day 1 the request is egregious you should look at it yourself but just look at these two parts in particular they re saying we have a failure condition that can lead to catastrophic ie everyone dies failure and our lawyers agree it s not extremely improbable but don t worry we have a fix that relies on pilots never forgetting the 5minute rule and also we won t take into account their human needs as part of our safety system but don t worry they ll have a real fix by mid 2026 reading between the lies lines they want us to believe that the company with a history of deliberately hiding info from the faa noticed a theoretical issue by analyzing the data the same inlet that doesn t have a basic temperature sensors to alert pilots of overheating has sensors to detect issues like this bullshit after a dry flight over the american southwest some good mechanic noticed that this part was halfway fucking melted and told his boss they ran it up the chain had their oh shit moment and then instead of working on a fix went straight to work covering their asses to limit liability tell the faa so that faa can issue the ad with the shit remedy then if a plane crashes they can say faa gave them permission oh and they can just blame the pilots like they did last time for forgetting the 5 minute rule stupid pilots stop flirting with the stewardess and set your 5 minute timer again at the same time they re using leaks to the press to put the screws on the faa they ve hyped the stock so now if they faa blocks them all the ba bag holders will be mad at the faa and faa will be forced to make the good ole boys at boeing look bad boeing didn t learn their lesson these are the same people who killed 346 people due to their negligence and prioritization of profit over quality they haven t fucking changed people have noticed people are sick of boeing s bullshit absolutely sick take a look at any reddit thread on boeing twitter tiktok hacker news everywhere people are talking about how they will avoid these 737 maxs like the plague and fly airbus only but boeing isn t worried they know how short the consumer attention span is we ll all forget in a few weeks they re hoping and planning we aren t priced in this subreddit took down a hedge fund in 2021 for the fun of saving a fanfavorite video game store and the joy of stopping egregious greed in its track it s time to do it again i say fuck you dave calhoun fuck you boeing execs i m sick of these shitty planes i m sick of the lies sick of the lack of transparency sick of the huge wall street payouts while corners are cut again and again in production its time for a reckoning it s time for boeing to once again become a symbol of great american engineering not a symbol of wall street greed and i believe we can make this happen not on our own of course but we are not alone the american people are angry from the 2019 crashes they re angry about the window popping out they re angry about this safety exclusion all they need is a vanguard to show the way our demand is simple no safety exclusion faa must not grant it if they do southwest must not buy these airplanes if they do i m not fucking riding in them unleash the meme war machine buy puts sell your ba short ba we aren t fucking priced in x200b x200b x200b

bbbagholders here s how we can still win a baby stock spinoff have you ever played a hand in poker where someone makes a strange bet that seems out of character your spidey sense goes off and you start reconstructing the sequence of events that led to where you are now think about it why would rc pump and dump on his ape army for a measly $68m if that were true it would spell the end of gme and his $1b stake in that company based on afterhours activity he s already lost more than $140m worth of value on his gme shares this afternoon i d like to refer you to rc venture s letter to bbby here in particular suggestion 2 seek to monetize the ultimate destination for babies another path that can streamline bed bath s strategy and unlock value trapped within the company s underperforming shares is a sale or spinoff of the baby banner given that baby is estimated to reach $15 billion in sales in fiscal year 2023 with a doubledigit growth profile and at least 50 digital penetration we believe it is likely much more valuable than the company s entire market capitalization today9 assuming continued growth and low doubledigit margins we estimate that baby could be valued at a doubledigit earnings multiple on a standalone basis we believe under the right circumstances baby could be valued on a revenue multiple like other ecommercefocused retailers and justify a valuation of several billion dollars in the event bed bath pursued a full or partial sale of baby it could position itself to pay off debt put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count thereby creating significant value for shareholders spinning off shares of baby would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders notably baby s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles we assume bed bath and baby could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers how would a baby spinoff even work in a pure spinoff a company distributes 100 of its ownership interest in a unit as a stock dividend to existing shareholders it s a taxfree method of divestiture that usually helps both the parent and unit achieve better results as separate and more highlyvalued entities wait a minute stock dividend where have i heard that before yes you heard that right right the parent company would issue 80 million new shares of baby to existing shareholders aka a fork for all my buttcoin bros baby can fly on its own as chewy 20 shoutout to uhgyyyyyyyyyii for the heads up and the parent company gets saddled with the debt and files chapter 11 existing shareholders are no worse for the wear but shorts on the other hand if the fomo from the news of a spinoff doesn t do it it ll be the forced buying by all the entities who failed to deliver shares since there aren t enough shares of newlyformed baby to go around how do i know they failed to deliver shares and by dumping his entire stake before such an event rc removes any suggestion of impropriety if he owned shares and then triggered a squeeze the sec would absolutely drop the hammer on him what does rc get out of this he makes out with a cool $68m for his troubles or maybe rc ventures buys baby if so i have to think a deal has been made already counterpoint rc spent 6 months dealing with the shitshow that is bbby and decided it wasn t worth saving so he dumped his entire stake and spent it all on hookers and blow source in my mind these are the only 2 outcomes that could possibly explain today s events which one is more likely action to you call raise or fold
marketmeme summer insanity coming uvxy explained so for all you nose bleeding fairy godmothers out there i am here to put some pepto bismol up ur ass for the summer i want to help you even though i hate your guts i am extremely good at timing major market moves this last 2 months was a very brutal ass pounding but pretty precise in its wave dynamic in setting up for one of the most bullish moves with the vix 25 in my lifetime for the next 25 months last week was a very strong initial confirmation and this week will solidify it does anyone know why the vix was smashing 35 but unable to break and why uvxy did not move in a parabolic way on this correction or bear market because we re not in a fucking bear market you finger smelling substitute teachers this was the most violent bear trap i ve seen in my life there s so many answers to this question but one parameter to have a violent correction the market needs to stabilize up wave 5 or b wave if you will it s a function of the stock market it has to or it will never go back up ever again we haven t had that it s represented by the movement in uvxy and the overall day to day movement in the market we still havent had it the importance of uvxy movement can tell you the strength of spy on a minute to minute hourdaymonth to month etc anyone who talks about uvxy and tries to explain its movement with decay and contango and front month futures just go back in your cage harambe the easiest way to explainshow this is how uvxy peaked early may but the market went lower the next 3 weeks on may 5th the market went up 1 in 1 minute one in one minute this is a stabilizer of momentum the bull market stabilizes up to allow for a violent overextension downwards aka bear trap while maintaining a bullish bias i thought this overextension would last 3 days the drophedge funds blew up that day the doji then cpi reversal as most simple vix events last 3 days with that pattern instead it took 3 weeks but the same pattern held true the purpose of this is to maintain bearish momentum in the marketeither much further outyears or extremely violent this year we ll get to that that means the market knows where it s going yes it does crazy for a million reasons yes but true the importance of friday s move is thismarket up 2 thurs uvxy flat market up 22 friday uvxy flat market up 4 in the last 30 seconds of trade uvxy crushedddd the last week of movement wasn t bullish it was just not bearish the bull market just activated the last 30 seconds of tradeso what do you think is coming apes the market wasn t even impulsing higher it was a reactive move off of the blow off bottom the last 3 weeksand you know thisbecause of how uvxy moved i ve watched uvxyspy movement every day for 10 years this is the correlation this is why so many people are confused when they are both up or down together it has nothing to do with decay ur mother s ass warts or trump another way to see this is may 19th the market was flat but uvxy got crusheddd this represents the market catching the weight of the market and holdingaccerlerating up i know this to be true because again i ve watched the correlation for 10 years it may take a day a week or 6 months to play out but it always does and it s up to you to figure it out it is the larger wave dynamic in the market doing what it needs to do to prepare for future moves and in this case it is confirming it already this is only 1 piece of many many things i see and thus i see an enormous wave higher coming into the summer i have my targets and assumptions of what to see basic ta can never see these waves which is why so many people get fucked a candle is not a candle is not a candle the quality of the intraday movement actually matters targets spy ath or close to ath by august we are in buy the dip trend not sell the rip everyone in the world is saying sell the rip the memearkk trade will explode in junejuly i expect gme to break at least 250 with a target of about 380 with possible ath all other meme targets will track gme target as they are all basket stocks and move together sorry to burst the bubble though after this rally there is a very high chance we ll have a flash crash in about august if things get triggered we will flash crash in a way the market has never seen before as per the vix wave dynamic this down momentum never disappears it is forever in the market until it gets released if not this year it will eventually happen that i can time when ready i ve never seen something this scary before like actually i get scared thinking about it my guess is 75 on the vix but really fast with a fast recovery this isn t the big one for the memes or the market itself either it ll be a great buying opportunity into 2023 for boomer stocks if it happens in aug tldr hopefully i could have shed some light on uvxy which blew up my account many years ago if i can help a few degens not double down on bearish sentiment why not buy and hold memes into july and if things get triggered a flash crash of epic proportions in august also recession 2023 not 2022 fucking nerds xd not financial advice for those crying about show something max bear copium i have no problem taking ur money ps dont do like me and buy spy buy spx for 60 ltg instead whoops

iiprputs is the play i have called it out before all i got was some window lickers asking for my positions but with all the crying and complaining about the old days and the great dd here you go i would answer any questions i try and lay out what appears obvious to me but i am sure plenty is missing x200b what is iipr innovative industrial properties inc nyse iipr is an internally managed real estate investment trust reit focused on the acquisition ownership and management of specialized properties leased to experienced statelicensed operators for their regulated cannabis facilities as of june 30 2022 we owned 111 properties comprising an aggregate of approximately 86 million rentable square feet including approximately 25 million rentable square feet under development or redevelopment in arizona california colorado florida illinois maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri nevada new jersey new york north dakota ohio pennsylvania texas virginia and washington iipr currently pays a dividend of 753 pct tard translation they will buy a property give the end user all the money it needs to build out an incredibly expensive cannabis facility and then lease the space back to the user saleleaseback the user will pay annual rent to iipr and that is how most of the cannabis industry is funded since it does not have access to traditional financing at reasonable rates due to federal illegality this type of financing will typically result in the tenant paying approx 1215 pct not ideal since most cannabis tenants are not cash flow positive yet example minneapolis sept 28 2021 prnewswire goodness growth holdings inc goodness growth or the company cse gdns otcqx gdnsf a physicianled sciencefocused cannabis company and ip developer today announced the closing of a sale leaseback transaction with innovative industrial properties inc iip nyse iipr in the state of new york goodness growth sold and iip acquired approximately 923 acres of land adjacent to goodness growth s existing cannabis cultivation and processing facility in johnstown new york which was formerly the site of a juvenile detention center the purchase price for the land was approximately $12 million excluding transaction costs and iip is expected to provide tenant improvement reimbursement to goodness growth of approximately $550 million for the construction of a new 324 000 square foot cannabis cultivation processing and research and development facility after all is said and done goodness growth will pay an annual rent of around 6 million plus all the expenses of operating the building taxes and insurance to iipr x200b ok now that part is out of the way this is where it gets ugly very fast for iipr and shareholders x200b lets look at 2 tenants above kings garden per 8k filed july 13th 2022 item 801 other events iipca 2 lp landlord an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of innovative industrial properties inc the company previously entered into leases collectively the leases with kings garden inc as tenant tenant for each of the six properties that landlord owns on july 13 2022 tenant defaulted on its obligations to pay base rent and property management fees for the month of july under each of the leases and defaulted on its obligations to reimburse landlord for certain insurance premiums at the properties incurred by landlord that are payable by tenant as operating expenses under the leases tenant s monetary default under all of the leases was approximately $22 million in the aggregate consisting of approximately $18 million of base rent and property management fees for the month of july and approximately $382 000 of insurance premiums but excluding applicable late charges and default interest the company is continuing discussions with tenant regarding the leases and has commenced discussions with other operators regarding potential releasing of certain of such properties and you can see the impact on the sp x200b x200b sh parent surterra its my opinion this tenant will default next below are headlines from 3 known lawsuits the company is facing this tenant makes up approximately 10 of the rental income for iipr and the company has invested over 127 million in them to date wrigley fights $80 million claim over parallel s failed illinois marijuana deal by mjbizdaily staff july 5 2022 updated july 6 2022 investors sue parallel for alleged securities fraud scheme a trio of investors filed a lawsuit in florida federal court earlier this month against the company and its former ceo william beau wrigley jr march 24 2022 ceres acquisition corp neo cereuotcqx ceraf has decided to call off the business combination agreement dated february 21 2021 with sh parent inc also known as parallel ceres said it plans to continue looking for another company for its qualifying transaction before the deadline of march 3 2022 unless of course that date is extended with shareholder approval no confidence reuters reported that several investors had lost confidence in parallel s ability to deliver on lofty financial projections it provided in february when the merger was announced with just 42 stores and in some small markets like texas the ability to deliver more revenue than companies twice its size had to give investors pause reuters also reported that several investors who had committed to the $225 million private investment had refused to invest over the following months since parallel is a private company actual revenue figures aren t disclosed if one estimates parallel s revenues and parallel doesn t like it get ready to hear from their lawyer x200b if you just looked at these 2 tenants and the exposure iipr has 18 on its net income you can see the trouble they are really in this is without going below the very obvious topical issues take a look a bit deeper and you will find iipr committing around 100 million to tenants in 2021 deals that would be rated f credit or lower 4front ventures ffntf august 03 2021 0606 pm eastern daylight time san diegobusiness wireinnovative industrial properties inc iip the first and only real estate company on the new york stock exchange nyse iipr focused on the regulated us cannabis industry announced that it closed on the acquisition of a property in illinois and entered into a longterm lease with a subsidiary of 4front ventures corp cse ffnt otcqx ffntf 4front we are excited to expand our partnership with iip as the illinois marketplace continues its recordbreaking sales streak the purchase price for the property was $65 million excluding transaction costs 4front is expected to construct approximately 250 000 square feet of industrial space at the property for which iip has agreed to provide reimbursement of up to $4375 million assuming full reimbursement for the construction iip s total investment in the property is expected to be $5025 million excluding transaction costs 4front intends to operate the property upon completion of construction as a licensed cannabis cultivation and processing facility x200b iip also owns and leases to subsidiaries of 4front a regulated cannabis cultivation processing and dispensing facility in massachusetts and a managed regulated cannabis cultivation and processing facility in washington assuming full reimbursement for tenant improvements under the illinois lease iip

600 000 debt of approx 48 600 000 cash flow negative x200b conclusion iipr is fucked bad in my opinion half the portfolio consists of tenants that are f rated and may not be solvent this time next year on the prior earnings call a few analysts attempted to question management about this very scenario and they were able to deflect and downplay the threat they scoffed at the idea that a large tenant would not pay monthly rent the next call will be in the first 2 weeks of august and they are in a for a brutal interrogation at the end of each month iipr has to be sweating those rent checks coming in who will default next who will see kings garden default and try the same move that dividend its not looking very safe x200b for all you chart nerds x200b x200b si currently sitting at approx 7 of ff which for a supposedly sterling reit is a bit high x200b current positions and will be adding at every opportunity i had traded a decent amount of july puts prior x200b

fear and greed index any regard here know if there were periods in the past where this feargreed chart goes extended either in extreme greed or extreme fear for consecutive months at a time in the past year this feargreed chart has done a good job of marking inflection points in changing directions in the market but i think it is going to stay extreme greed for several months as the market continues to rally making this indicator useless now

the pltr myth and investor political spectrum please view my last post for recent none scientific poll on the issue i think like many you will be surprised surprising to some and contrary to main stream media s narrative currently a bell curve with 1 day left in voting the upcoming uk nhs deal will once again prove pltr is inching closer to not only american government monopoly but also global nato countries it is worth noting that it is currently blitzing its way through public companies the myth and true lie palantir and its investors are war mongerl deep data secret conspiracy lets take over your life pro trump go america f the world software the reality palantir and its investors come from all parts of the political spectrum many care more of its public sector than its government sector palantir also contributes to minimizing needless suffering by allowing humans to forsee geopolitical environmental and human health advancement much like a chess game building digital infrastructure for datadriven operstion and decision making it is also the best known data software companies that is the best preserving the only known working system that has lifted more people out of poverty then any other system democracy foundry gotham appolo serve as the connective tissue between an organisation s data its analytics capabilities and operational execution democracy it may not have been perfect but the lack of true working alternative system is factual not socialism fascism communism imperialism have ever achieved more for human advancement then democracy you could argue that some ancient civilization in history used some different system that pleased you but can we truly extract there data and see if they did better they have dissapeared because the system failed we could argue that the past 100 years humans have advanced more then the rest of its history combined and one of its most crucial element to the formula is democracy more specifically western modern democracy again the lack of proven working better alternative is real edit independent compose those who swing different directions based on different policies and libertarians disclaimer i own pltr and am lucky to be young enough to hold forever
put your gains into nesn nestl instead of increasing your exposure so nestle the swiss behemoth that s been around forever is suddenly looking like that overlooked stock at a garage sale you know the one hiding between a rock and a hard place its stock has hit the same lows we saw back when toilet paper was worth its weight in gold thanks to covid while the immediate growth opportunities for nestle might seem limited prompting this recent price adjustment there are a few reasons why this might actually present a compelling longterm investment opportunity the dividend yield is sitting at a tasty 32 because of the stock price dip that s like getting paid in swiss chocolates just to hold onto their shares except these chocolates compound over time it s a sweet deal for anyone looking to park their cash somewhere with a bit of stability and still get a paycheck out of it now let s not forget about the swiss franc chf which has been on a bit of a diet since the year kicked off for the global investors among us this could mean some currency gains if the franc decides to beef up again combine that with a potential rebound in nestle s stock and you ve got a recipe for more than just fondue so while it might not be the flashiest adrenalinepumping name on your portfolio screen nestle could very well be the steady eddie that sails through the chaos dividend checks in hand remember this ain t financial advice just a hot take on a cold stock do your own research but maybe just maybe nestle deserves a spot on your watchlist

tbt is the only guaranteed money in a retarded market and burry was right since late 2021 the fed has signaled and telegraphed every single move that they ve been making in september they talked about ending qe and moving into qt and raising rates to slow down an overheated economy with too much money flying around well there was a shit ton printed like 5 trillion with a t shit ton so now most banks don t think that there will be less than 57 rate hikes or whatever the main point is that the fed funds rate gets up near 225 so that the free money is over imagine you re a big enough baller to get access to fed funds and you just take zero interest money and then go make 25 on 2 year treasuries say you do that with a billion dollars congrats you just made 25 million doing absolutely fucking nothing my next point burry called this one and has had a $280 million position in tbt and is probably already up 30 or more more importantly other people said don t fight the fed and the fed isn t your friend both true statements thus far but if you listen to what they ve been saying then you would ve heard that they have been intent on raising rates raising these rates causes the value of the treasuries themselves to drop which means tlt drops inversely tbt increases ideally you would ve gotten into this trade back when tlt just started to drop after peaking at 150 now it s down to 120 and still has room to drop further especially with continued hikes on the table when do you get out of this trade easy pay attention to the fed meetings every quarter and when they stop fucking with rates then you get out but this will continue for awhile i know this isn t wsb s idea of a moon money banana man super gambler degenerate legend trade you won t become a gorillionaire off of this shit but like i said it s possible that this right here is the only truly guaranteed trade position holding $6k of tbt and highly considering yeeting about $100k more into it after the above considerations i m interested to hear out other opinions on this this market fuckery has been going on for far too long

the tinfoil hat theory to rule all tinfoil hat theories the tinfoil hat theory to rule all tinfoil hat theoriesreverse fud beat them at their own game i was searching on the sec website to see if rc ventures ever filed a form 144 for bbby before there are two different pages to search form 144s dependent upon if it was filed electronically or through mail interestingly enough the paper records only go back to right after the point at which rc ventures would have filed their last one i believe this was known by rc and is being used as the match that lights the fuse for the rocket to the moon paper form 144 filings records this got my ape wheel thinnning i think that perhaps the story was planted with a reporter to create the fud and sell off in order to have the short headphones double down on their short positions cohen will announce that he has the intention to sell to meet the intention required of the 144 provision when bbby meats a certain milestone perhaps something like the announcement of a certain baby store getting sold off or split to its own stock this will cause bbby to squeeze cohen well then sell his positions use the proceeds to double down on gme triggering the mother of short squeezes wham bam thank you ma am wombo combo achieved
bbby $30250 i just wanted to point out and recognize that the market cap of bbby is only 194b at the moment the peak market cap of gme was 2267b if bbby were to hit similar numbers that would represent the stock at about $30250 bbby s volume is already significantly higher than gme s volume at the same point in its cycle this is possible and realistic mind the fact that bbby s market cap has been well over 10b in the past

jim cramer says he expects the june market lows to hold and mark the bottom i like where we are now the mad money host said while acknowledging the market could test june s lows because there are plenty of reasons to be apprehensive however he added i m betting the market will bend not break through a rough september and when we get through that period that june low will hold since the june lows nothing has happened that would shatter the illusion or reality of a bottom cramer said noting that oil has remained well below $120 and the vast majority of companies that reported earnings in july and august did fine in fact he said there s been very few true disappointments without a spike in oil which would cause a collapse in corporate earnings then i think the june lows will hold notice i didn t say they should hold i said they will hold the trial will come when the fed starts selling its own bond holdings with reckless abandon as they keep raising rates that could create a test of the lows in september again but i m confident they ll hold source jim cramer says he expects the june market lows to hold and mark the bottom the sp 500s spx closing low this year came on june 16 at 3 66677 do you agree with cramer

$paa 455 return on investment is likely by initiating the january $12$17 call spread for a net debit of $090 with the distribution increase of 21 the unit price will appreciate over the next few months to a trading range of $1250$1400 per unit for clarity $paa is a master limited partnership not a ccorp therefore it s not a share it s a unit it s not a dividend it s a distribution buying the $12$17 january 2024 call spread for a net debit of $090 has a high probability of achieving maximum return of $500 per spread $paa currently generates free cash flow that covers the distribution by 250 after expenses interest capex the company s target is 140 this means they are retaining enough cash to more than double the distribution to pay down debt after the leverage target of 40 is achieved later this year the company will announce another increase in the distribution in late 2022 or early 2023 this will further increase the unit price making the option play reach full profit

an $alt route to weight loss drug tendies i was considering doing real dd on this one with more indepth research but i ll just flag this as a discussion out of laziness my question is whether $alt altimmune is greatly undervalued at the moment i m thinking there might be some deep pharma value in this stock based on comparing it to another similar stock that has been seeing some great gains and a much bigger market cap recently my thesisharebrained idea arises from comparing $alt to $vktx viking therapeutics in both product type and performance as well as both companies basic financials here s some key points that have led me to be interested in $alt the star product in the pipeline for each company is a weight loss drug both are dual receptor agonists things that mimic chemicals in the bodybind to receptors to produce an effect such as the patient feeling full so they will stop overeating altimmune s drug is a glp1glucagon agonist whereas viking s drug is a glp1gip agonist pharma is not my industry so someone can tell me if my googling is incorrect but it seems like glp1 mono agonist drugs are how most of the current fdaapproved weight loss drugs function to get the bmichallenged buying in droves so both altimmune and viking should have something that will prove to be effective in weight loss plus possibly provide additional significant benefits eg lower cholesterol and blood pressure alt has shown to help them compete when they enter the rapidly expanding weight loss market as far as i can tell alt s drug is an injection like most current options and vktx has mostly trialed theirs as an injection but also more recently started also trialing a pill form altimmune has two drugs shown in their pipeline on their website pemvidutide two trials for obesity and nash treatment and heptcell one trial for chronic hbv who doesn t hate hepatitis viking s pipeline is a little more robust with three drugs undergoing trials vk2735 two trials for obesity and metabolic disorders that seems to be for nash based on press releases and the fact that the majority of overweight people have high liver fat and its associated issues vk2809 one trial specifically for nash using a different agonist than their weight loss drug and vk0214 one trial for rare disease xald viking s website also proudly displays a few other drugs they have on the backburner a couple related to diseases common with obesity though not as hypeworthy as a weight loss drug altimmune does not show any obvious pipeline for drugs not yet in the approval process though i can t imagine they don t have other projects in the works when they are an older company and have double the number of employees that viking does altimmune s star drug pemvidutide is actually a little bit ahead of viking s weight loss drug in the trial phase and approval process alt already has presented results from a phase 2 48week study for obesity treatment and has their nash trial in phase 2 after showing pretty decent results in phase 1 and they estimate end of phase 2meeting with the fda on the obesity trial mid2024 nash trial results are expected q1 2025 in contrast the more hyped vktx trials still are awaiting results from their venture study to report vk2735 s effectiveness in treating obesity believe i saw somewhere they expect to share that q1 2024 hence recent hype and the vk2735 trial for metabolic disorders is still in phase 1 their other nash drug vk2809 is undergoing phase 2 trials but that one sadly doesn t contain the magic medicine that has manic mobs of manatees beating down the doors for weight loss drugs already available on the market comparing the efficacy of the two companies weight loss drugs is much more challenging due to the differences in trial progress and result reporting so i m not going to pretend like i have the expertise to even try the few numbers i found that vktx has reported on weight loss sound decent but were at a short time scale and kind of opaque in what the actual numbers were eg saying participants all lost weight but only giving a percentage weight loss number for the top of the range altimmune is clearly a bunch of datadriven scientists so their results are quite transparent and make it easy to see that their weight loss drug is effective i don t normally read drug trial data to know what the fda does and doesn t like to see but very significant treatment effectiveness coupled with manageable side effects sounds like a green light to phase 3 to me only one severe adverse reaction of vomiting for one patient at the highest dose otherwise just mild to moderate gi issues that all of the approved weight loss drugs also have due to glp1 s role in the gut alt s nash trial for it s golden drug also seems to be delivering promising results their recent poster for a nashtag conference shows good data on reducing biomarkers associated with liver inflammation and fibrosisstiffness hard to compare to vktx s nash treatment at this point since their data is more focused on direct liver fat measurements and not the liver health problems that develop from it though they seem to have good nash results so far as well and the more exciting part where i compare things that might mean i can make some money the market cap of $alt is currently around $561m whereas the market cap of $vktx is around $3b yes that is in fact a 56x disparity that could easily resolve itself once big investors discover the value here either when alt advances closer to fda approval for their weight loss drug or maybe a big pharma player will decide to gobble up the company as an easy entry into the lucrative weight loss market my point here of course assumes most of each company s value stems from the potential of their weight loss drug but i really don t think that s an unreasonable perspective alt s balance sheet shows around $140m cash and short term investments whereas vktx has around $376m vktx actually burned more cash in its last quarterly report $32m vs $15m though they had similar fcf alt slightly more negative remember both still need to get their products to market to make money point here is neither company is desperate for cash at the moment alt will likely want to raise some money at some point sooner but that will likely be after the stock has had a nice run from positive news so they don t need to dilute shares too much side note alt has 54m shares outstanding while vktx has 100m so i personally for now am using that as a quick way to see that alt may still be undervalued if it isn t getting close to double the stock price of vktx fintel reports short interest as a percentage of the float as about 20 for $alt and around 145 for $vktx this may indicate investors are a little more skeptical of alt s potential my quick googling suggests past hits to $alt s price came after the positive obesity phase 2 results were reported since some investors were concerned by the fact the trial design did not allow for willynilly dose changes for patients who experienced any side effects which would make the data pretty useless so it may also indicate that short sellers have worse literacy than my fifth grade reading comprehension for those who have a hereditary gambling addiction like myself and want to delve into options rather than just buying shares $alt has much more reasonable premiums to get in the game since $vktx has been going on a nice run for the past few months something something iv tldr i think $alt s most valuable drug is quite comparable to $vktx s most valuable drug they are each developing since the companies are similar some pros and cons for each i think they should be valued similarly at this moment in time making that the case would require $alt to be worth $50 instead of $10 like it is now assuming $vktx doesn t even rise from its current price and potentially raise my price target further i m curious if any other highly regarded members of this community have more expertise to either back up my thesis or to tell me why i m a pathetic idiot who deserves to stay poor disclaimer i have no expertise or certifications in either the pharmaceutical or financial industries i m a semiconductor engineer so it is quite possible i am completely wrong on some or all of the points i have tried to present above regarding cutting edge medicine for new and emerging types of treatments i even had to google what an agonist is so do not take anything i ve written as fact without seeking direct sources of information yourself it is your duty to do your own due diligence to understand what your are investing in if you decide you may want to go long or short in any position related to either of the stocks i ve mentioned and just any stock in general for that matter for transparency i do already own a position in $alt stock specifically i bought 25 mar01 24$15 calls at $040 and 30 jan17 25$20 calls at an average of approximately $254 i may acquire a larger position or exit some or all of my position in the future as suits my investment goals without making any public announcements you people shouldn t be mindlessly copying anyone s trades anyway
volume tickers in play trading thesis tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment s price i look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day with a marketcap of no less than 500 million the shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used or shares traded that information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected uptrending tickers snap 61623 9c 106 nvax 61623 75c 88 jks 61623 50c 110 iep 61623 325c 120 downtrending tickers nnox 61623 15p 80 mcd 61623 260p 50 u 61623 25p 52 rblx 61623 35p 113 goog 61623 118p 145 nvda 62623 250p 142 rh 61623 205p 160 amc 61623 55p 46 rivn 61623 15p 142 edit 61623 9p 45 mrna 61623 125p 170 tv 61623 5p 142 tlry 61623 25p 21 googl 611623 1175p 130 amzn 61623 110p 147 ionq 61623 10p 85 mu 61623 60p 56 dkng 61623 24p 110 dks 61623 115p 120 pacw 61623 8p 140 avgo 72123 520p 165 v 61623 215p 197 yum 61623 130p 150 dri 61623 155p 150 cwh 61623 26p 115 things to consider when finding the plays if the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket i will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day if the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before i will consider it for a long play if trading less than the movement of the ticker i would consider a short or put play if all the other factors previously mentioned checks out the trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed

fuck the financial times these mfs do this kind of shit repeatedly they should be sued to the fucking ground they label themselves as a reputable news source but from time to time they take advantage of the market environment to report absolutely fake news for a brief period of time that benefits them and which causes hysteria they were the ones throwing numbers randomly about the buyout of credit suisse by ubs first saying that ubs was buying cs for $1b to grab the headlines then later on removed their frontpage article and reported $2b then later on did the same and reported $325b today their frontpage was all about western alliance exploring a potential sale after the pacw shitshow wal plunged 60 on the spot everyone was shorting the fuck out of every bank stock then wal had to release a statement saying that the ft article was absolutely fake algos immediately reacted and pumped the fuck out of wal and other bank stocks in the end shareholders had to sell their wal shares and other bank shares at a massive loss to cut potential heavier losses only to see the stock prices back up once the ft news article was deemed fake simultaneously intraday wal shorts and put buyers were left massively underwater too just look at the massive gap up on wal s chart that followed wal s statement that the ft were full of shit longs wiped out shorts wiped out all as a result of the ft manipulation these mfs keep getting away with this shit cnbc are reporting that wal are considering legal action against the ft i sincerely hope they bury these fuckers

the fed will not be able to fight inflation catch 22 two of the three major us indices are currently in a bear market the yield curve initially inverted a couple months back but only for a few minutes as the yield on the 10 year continued to rise back over the 2 year last week however the yield curve seems to have inverted for good and the spread on the yield continues to increase the value of the dollar has gone parabolic alongside soaring inflation cpi is at a 41 year high at 91 yet interest rates are at a mere 2 year high just 158 historically the federal reserve has been able to control generally speaking rising inflation by raising the federal funds rate to parallel the percentage increase in the cost of consumer goods as inflation increases the fed has raised rates at effectively the same level or higher to reduce consumer demand preventing inflation from spiraling out of control comparing historical interest rates to cpi you can see how interest rates parallel cpi which is evident from the 1960s to 1980s paul volcker fed chair from 1979 to 1987 is widely credited with having ended the high levels of inflation seen in the united states throughout the 1970s and early 1980s volcker made the tough choice to raise interest rates to historically high levels which the fed did to fight historically high interest rates resulting in a subsequent 21 equities correction a relatively mild recession that lasted just over a year the relationship between interest rates and the cpi has taken a wild turn over the last year as a result of the fed s response to the pandemic by lowering interest rates to near zero and doubling its balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion other external factors such as supply chain bottlenecks and ongoing geopolitical conflicts between russia and ukraine are adding to inflationary pressures although the commodities market has cooled off over the past few weeks a major problem persists the fed is unable to raise interest rates high enough to fight record high inflation in 1981 volcker raised interest rates to nearly 20 which was 4 higher than the rate of inflation at the time this was a necessary step to reduce demand just enough to tackle inflation compare that to where we re at now cpi is currently 91 but interest rates are nearly 8 lower than the current rate of inflation based on the historical relationship between interest rates and inflation the fed is completely aware of how global markets have become entirely dependent on loose monetary policy of low interest rates and ongoing quantitative easing the fed will not raise interest rates over the rate of inflation so either inflation will continue to rise leading to a global inflationary recession which is where we re heading now or it cuts the market off from capital relatively speaking by raising interest rates higher than the rate of inflation such as 11 to 13 which will never happen because it can t the market would collapse overnight the fed is in a very bad place and the economy may be on the verge of a historical collapse its back is up against a massive wall it s catch 22

what would candlestick charts of stocks and or other assets look like if buying and selling was solely a humanhuman transaction without the interference of market makers i propose a question what would candlestick charts of stocks and or other assets look like if buying and selling was solely a humanhuman transaction without the interference of market makers my intuition says the price would go straight up and not trend as often because let s say you purchase some shares of a company because you like the company you purchase these shares for $5 each and hold onto them somebody else offers you $4 and you decline their offer because that s lower than what you paid for the shares someone else comes along and offers you $6 and you accept eventually the price would just go higher basically in a world where market makers didn t exist people would own stock for very different reasons than they do now what do you think

inaccurate market caps and shares outstanding on a lot of brokers is starting to look really fishy hear me out i ve seen a lot of brokers showing conflicting information about market caps and shares outstanding lately and i m sure you have also stockbrokers are not legally allowed to provide you with misleading or false information if they do it is usually to support their individual investments or their company profits that s called stock broker fraud and to my understanding is quite the serious crime multibillion dollar companies should be able to a show proper market cap on any stocks they re selling b do math and c research to see proper shares outstanding market cap and fix their brokerage appssites to show the correct data this leads me to believe that they may actually be intentionally committing broker fraud see link in comments

who is the main cause of the sellthenews effect i used to just accept that selling the news made sense to secure profits but the longer i do this the more i am at odds with that i justified it in my mind by saying that the price probably had some weighted average of g b h priced in where g is good news b is bad news and h is hypebest case news i thought the sell off on reports of good news occurred because the news didn t meet the h requirement and the sell off was essentially a collapse to the correct price of the news however options trading has slowly rotted my brain and turned me into a conspiracy theorist i have started to believe that the sellthenews on good news is a trap for retail investors so that institutions can scalp cheap shares the recent selloff on ccl and then the subsequent mooning of the very same makes me think that big institutions really just use it as an opportunity to shake out retail investors for cheap shares cramer even said that they do this sort of thing the cheap price of ccl made it even easier for a fund to just throw a few million at a sell off and trigger all the algos and retails to dump their positions but it also happens to extremely liquid and expensive mega caps apple typically has a sell off after their events and then a week later it s back to a new ath so who is really responsible for these sell offs after good news is it algos is it institutions or hedge funds trying to use psychology to scalp cheap shares or something else

bbby the selffulfilling prophecy dearly regarded throughout wsb we re still seeing posts of despair and insecurity surrounding bbby paper handed btches running wild throughout the streets jerking off as soon as the feeling comes but diamond hands know holding it down results in the greatest pleasure of all as many posts have mentioned bbby is following the exact same path as gme why what is driving it what s making it such a pleasure to wake up everyday the answer is here 1 the short squeeze yes the short squeeze not referring to you nerds jerking off on a wednesday to the bbby chart right now the short interest is 46 more than enough juice to squeeze and the squeeze is cuming 2 exercised calls yes you cockmuffins talking about capturing as much extrinsic value as possible by not ever exercising your calls you re abandoning your fellow soldiers exercise them glutes make the shorts pay for their arrogance by blowing bbby beyond the moon beyond mars to uranus and beyond 3 market cap weight indexes what dis mean it means the more we buy the more they buy if we blow up bbby the institutional whales must by definition of their fund buy bbby if we don t sell then that buying pressure increases the market cap of bbby even more meaning they will need to buy even more to balance their index and so on until bbby reaches infinity 4 diamond hands we apes now control the majority of the float what does that mean it means the price will not maintain any sort of downtrend unless we fold and sell our dignity to the algos you wouldn t sell your mother to the algos so why tf would you sell bbby one last bit of dd buy buy baby is a massive play on the pandemic baby boom anecdotally my sister just got pregnant out of wedlock babies are coming that s it that s all there is if we buy exercise and hold we will win and we will win big it s simply a mathematical certainty take destiny into your own hands and move your hands up and down until you fulfill your oath to your fellow man ape and regard tldr we control bbby s fate now
8322 spy es futures and apple daily ta today we saw yet again a case of extreme bull momentum the bulls were out in full force today or should i say the bears didn t wanna sell today this is now the 5th day in a row where we have opened ran up dumped and a very convincing dump may i add only for us to then run even harder eod the craziest thing of the whole day is apple apple had an implied move of $201 with a improbable high of 16284 for those of you who don t know iv prices in movement everyday and overall it provides probable and improbable ranges generally speaking even touching the improbable high is rare let alone going over it so today we saw apple have a total dtr daily true range of 584 which is 290 of the implied iv move it was also 144 of the average 10day range and 134 of the 30day average range it reached nearly $4 over its improbable high of day this is one of the most imbalanced and unexpected moves i have ever seen on apple this was the greenest close apple has had since may 27th as you can see looking very interesting on the daily we have officially broke out of the red rising wedge we are now working on another black dotted rising wedge this one uses early june dates for the resistance line today apple perfectly hit that it uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line this pattern gives a high of 1676 and a low of 1629 we still have that gap down below also on apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap apple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses january 3rd and march 28th weekly highs as resistance that gives us a possible upside of 1745 next week overall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week overall spy and futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges i have seen in a while on the daily currently you can see on spy we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today it uses the july 29th and june 28th daily candles for resistance resistance for tomorrow will be at 4167 the black dotted resistance line uses july 29th july 8th july 7th and june 29th for resistance this give sus a resistance of 4188 tomorrow and then we have the red dotted resistance line from june 28th june 15th and june 13th which gives us resistance of 4235 for tomorrow we have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most i have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow the black dotted support line using august 3rd aug 2nd july 27th and july 26th we have 4138 as support tomorrow we broke the possible down trend resistance today too we are also about to hit the 4174 level support which is also the daily 200ema overall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today and that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control there is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema but i still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken if we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week a good cpi could fuel an even higher bull run too futures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178 red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241 the 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from june highs the biggest supports to watch for es is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow spy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today however end of day it lost that level this has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since april this will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over futures also rejecting this level of 4160 too this level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since april the bears will need to defend these 415 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the eow and next week overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and friday the vix had the biggest red close since june 15th the day of fomc i still struggle to short this until we see the vix do something other than drop every single day 10 challenge today was a great day i turned into an l by not following my own rules of course i played that morning drop pretty nicely got out for a 211 gain of course it pretty much went straight to 100 right after but got caught at what looked like a clear support break and close under 8ema only to get burnt i didn t manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over and then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher todays lesson stick to your rules and never ever fight momentum the momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet tomorrows a new day and a new chance i am carrying some 9dte apple 1525 puts overnight that i do suspect by next week to at minimum break even if we ever lose this bull momentum and we drop to gap fill as i suspect apple needs to then they will be sitting pretty good

unsolicited market technicals pregame hey you fuckers hope you all had an awesome 4th this year looks like we re heading into earnings season on some pretty shaky ground so i drew some lines n shit all over my charts and though i d share my take though most likely wrong lets start with the 10y looking like we re respecting this rising wedge typically a bearish pattern reinforced by the bearish divergence in the ppo momentum indicator looks like we re already getting our reaction with the latest drop i ve got a couple of key levels marked out at 27 and 17 i m thinking the fed is about to poosey out and pause the rate hikes in july moving onto light crude not seeing any bearish indicators here currently climbing back inside a bull flag which if the measured move plays out makes $150 per barrel a probability and $220 per barrel a possibility let s look at the us dollar seeing similar weakness in this chart as we did on the 10y bearish rising wedge and bearish divergence in the rsi and ppo a reversal is likely given these indicators aligning with my theory that the fed will poosey out in july looking at gold gold is also echoing the same technicals which lead to a fed poosey out in july mainly looking at the bullish divergence in the rsi and ppo i m waiting for this downtrend line to break then i ll be going long or if it can dump down to $1 677 sp 500 very bullish chart despite the story that price action is telling you we ve been inside this falling wedge pattern on bullish divergence in the ppo nasdaq a less rosy picture for tech unfortunately looks like we had put in very slight bullish divergence back in midmay which we ve been reacting from since on the slow grind higher however the down channel so far is intact conclusion i think that a lot of big money believes the fed is going to pause rate hikes in july given the technical indicators showing up and recent economic developments consumer spending is finally slowing atlanta fed has projected a negative gdp print in july which is our next quarterly print and would officially mark a recession if the fed pauses then expect the market to price that in very quickly but don t get pulled offsides because it s possible that it could be entirely offset by bad earnings and guidance keep your eye on oil if it continues to climb then that make force the fed back into an accommodation stance on the markets which would be ath in a matter of months positions gonna continue selling all the rips until fed flips

the russell 2000 is more volatile than the sp 500 and could underperform in a debt ceiling crisis puts on the russell 2000 during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis the russell 2000 fell 24 in a week while the sp 500 fell 17 one way to play this is to buy puts on the russell 2000 you can buy 1month 95 puts on the russell 2000 for 085 of the notional value this is a bet that the russell 2000 will decline by at least 5 within a month the russell 2000 could underperform in a future debt ceiling crisis the russell 2000 is more heavily weighted toward smallcap stocks smallcap stocks are typically more volatile than largecap stocks the russell 2000 also has a higher allocation to cyclical stocks cyclical stocks are more sensitive to economic conditions and can be more volatile in times of economic turmoil the russell 2000 has a 7 allocation to regional banks while the sp 500 only has 03 x200b if the us were to default on its debt it could lead to a debt ceiling crisis a debt ceiling crisis would likely cause a selloff in stocks and it could also lead to a rise in interest rates this would be harmful to smallcap stocks and cyclical stocks which are already more volatile than largecap stocks
theory sharp decline in the sp 500 within 4 months ta inside i came across an interesting statement from udaddydersch about 5 red candles and the rarity in the last 22 years this got me thinking what could this this mean as we are at 5 red weekly candles tldr 5 red weekly candles have only happened 8 times in the past 22 years with 6 red candles being more common than 5 additionally all 5 wrc have indicated a drop below the weekly 200 ema after a small pop positions friday next week spy c443 06172022 in four weeks spy p345 09162022 the dotcom bubble had the majority of the 5 weekly red candles between 2000 and 2005 with a total of 5 of the 8 total while 3 indicated a drop below 200 weekly ema and 2 happened while below the 200 ema the great recession or the 2008 financial crisis had another 5 wrc however we were just recovering from the dotcom bubble the 200 ema was already close and we saw it break 200 ema during the 3rd candle additionally we saw the largest decline from any 5 wrc with a push of 49 in may of 2011 we saw what i would say is the smoking gun of my theory a 5 wrc which was the precursor to the august black monday 2011 crisis we saw a drop to the 200 ema and a decline of 21 in about 17 weeks from the 5 wrc the last 5 wrc was the covid crash i do not see this as a true 5 wrc point but i have included it as we still hold true all the marks of a 5 wrc we saw a 32 drop smashing the 200 ema during the decline i have made a chart below as well as a few pictures to show my results rebuttal now we could experience a quick decline or with how computers have changed the landscape of trading we could never see a drop as low in the 4 months i m speculating to the 200 ema now i also looked into the 4 wrc and the results were quite mixed but also rare with only 13 events in the last 22 years 05012000 major drop 03182002 major drop 01132003 small drop then spike up 03102006 small spike up small drop then big spike up 12242007 small drop into 2nd 4 candle 02192008 small spike up into major drop 01052009 drop into 2nd 4 candle 02092009 spike up 01112010 small spike up drop spike up 07252011 post 6 candle spike up drop spike up 09222014 spike up 05312016 spike up as last week s red candle was an extremely small red candle some may say that it shouldn t qualify i did not go into a fuller detail as i did the 5 wrc but as you can see from the list we would still generally see 9 drops of some kind and 7 climbs up feel free to include more for the rebuttal 5 wrc table reddit hates tables this big i m not remaking this table again see pictures x200b pictures attached ema 20 red 50 orange 100 teal 200 blue thank you for reading welcome to the latest recession i wonder what they will name it please excuse grammar and spelling errors english is my native tongue

is the ai bubble burst likely to occur soon if so how terrible could it be as someone who s cautious of the current boom in aioriented stocks the skyrocketing prices of nvidia amd others it obviously seems rather unrealistic to believe these stocks will continue to soar so high knowing the previous history of burst bubbles in the us markets such as the early 2000 s i find it quite terrifying to think of when these ai stocks will fall apart i ve been fortunate to hold onto some nvidia stock that has made great gains but it truly seems like a house of cards do you folks believe the bubble will burst soon are we all going forward into a cramer disaster of horrible proportions what are your honest opinions and advice regarding this
calls on wmt just visited my local walmart and heres what happened i 27m initially went in for an oil change and my wife tagged along to buy halloween items for her bf upon arriving to the oil service department i had to wait a 27 minute line to drop my car off there was a line of about 7 people and 1 employee i ve been to this walmart 3 times and every single time they have my car saved as a different year than it actually is meanwhile my wife was shopping in the halloween section i meet up with her and she s finally ready to go pay after finding a skimpy outfit for herself we go to find a cashier and there are 4 cashiers open out of 24 we wait for 20 minutes in line and then we get to the front we ask the kind lady behind the counter if the costume can be returned but she doesn t speak english only spanish we finally get a hold of someone who can help us after 5 minutes and they inform us that we can return it as long as its before halloween we go have lunch at our local wendy s and then return to pick up my car after waiting 2 hours for the oil change i had to wait 32 minutes in line in order to pay for my car the moral of the story is that walmart is saving so much money by not having employees despite the store being slammed that their profits must be incredible tldr walmart doesnt hire enough employees so their profits must be great

why snow puts will be an easy win yesterday i explained why crwd calls were gonna be easy profits and got 220c s for 390 these calls are now 1365 over 3x gains with the stock up almost 10 today at the time of writing now today we re going to look at snowflake snow reporting q3 earnings on today analysts forecast earnings of $0159 per share as opposed to earnings of $0110 in the same quarter of the previous year snowflake is expected to report sales of $7136 million an increase of 2811 over the same period last year for the current fiscal year they expect earnings per share of $0683 compared to $0250 per share in the previous year on average we are expecting a revenue of $275 billion compared to $207 billion last year for those who don t know the company s key offering is a scalable efficient cloudbased data warehousing platform snowflake s platform enables organizations to store and analyze large volumes of structured and semistructured data thus businesses can run complex queries across multiple cloud platforms snowflake s fiscal thirdquarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base notably it added more than 400 snowpark customers and consumption grew roughly 70 on a sequential basis in the fiscal second quarter big customers include mastercard honeywell and disney at the end of the fiscal second quarter snow had 402 customers with trailing 12month product revenues greater than $1 million up 62 year over year and 639 forbes global 2000 customers up 166 year over year of the global 2000 customers 63 are using snowpark on a weekly basis customers are accessing snowflake for data science machine learning ml and artificial intelligence ai and this is a really hot topic because as an ai play snowflake appears positioned for longterm success if headwinds further diminish snowflake s innovative approach places it at the forefront of significant trends in generative ai and related tools the company introduced snowflake cortex a userfriendly service enabling both technical and nontechnical users to analyze data and build ai applications a standout feature is the universal search function streamlining data location within the data lake with a chatgptstyle bot facilitating easy answers to business queries the growing adoption of snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company s topline growth in the tobereported quarter snowflake has been expanding its ml footprint with the introduction of mlpowered sql extensions such as anomaly detection top insights and time series forecasting which are useful for analysts optimization yeah snow s got some kinks to iron out the company faces optimization challenges but consumption headwinds are starting to chill out a return to normal consumption growth and new product introduction should support growth ai benefits are expected but the impact is uncertain additionally snowflake stock is trading at a pe of 246 currently the high valuation creates downside risk if growth doesn t stabilize the company s outlook may be limited unless growth stabilizes consensus analyst ratings for snowflake stock stand at a buy with a price target of $18327 the stock is currently in the 170s morgan stanley research analyst sanjit singh sees snowflake well positioned given the multiple avenues for growth however he cautions that the potential for retrieval augmented generation rag applications might encounter increased competition morgan stanley has a $215 price target on snowflake stock piper sandler analyst brent a bracelin expects earnings volatility to continue as snowflake reports q3 earnings the biggest debate for those analyzing the company will be tied to whether cloud optimization headwinds that have pressured growth for more than a year begin to abate he said bottom line snow s got the tech and the talent to skyrocket but they gotta keep their growth game tight keep your eyes peeled traders snow s about to show us that they re a winter wonder for earnings i m considering getting 170p why puts after all my research it seems extremely bullish but i have to consider the moves from previous earnings despite a good report down over 7 last time the time before 11 even worse the quarter before that snow seems to go against common sense here and take a dip with good news at least 3 times in a row snow 121 170p at 480 works for me because it would require only a 6 drop to break even the company has seen an average of 9 move with earnings to make things cheaper you can consider a put spread regardless just like my other posts this isn t financial advice i d like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play this hopefully will help you with future earning plays too we have okta and dell this week stay tuned
am i doing this right brb have to go to my local wendy s
avya a look at the new ceo s compensation letter and implications first to the mods this company was a 175b market cap company at the beginning of the year has been crushed and it s mkt cap tanked but for most of it s life similar to gme it met the mkt cap threshold x200b hello all it s me doinshit contrary to the title i have been doing shit research can search around for previous dd i wrote but i m here to do a refresher on the float calculations so hold onto your panties and get some glue ready to sniff because after this it will be solidify in your head that this is the only play theodore aka king champ besty zaddddy the activist filing earlier in the week showed he owns 13231m shares from we have the following whales with filings as recent as 815 and no later than 89 vanguard owns 9 531 774 11 capital world 8 369 041 97 blackr0ck 7476 255 87 american centurry companies 5 950 649 69 theodore 12 231 360 1441 total 43 559 079 in total we add all of this up and we have 4355m shares now i go to the latest 10q to find the shares outstanding which is 85837m so with this information we have float of 85837m4355m 42337 this is old news the new information is the new ceo s contract x200b wall of text but notice that he received a 4million dollar cash bonus which is to be used explicitly to purchase shares of the company s stock in open market transactions you can view his exact offer letter here x200b so the price after the letter $2 then avaya dumped hard below $1 if maesrek is the chad i know he his then he secured shares at an average price of $1 if so thats 4million shares reduced from float given this we can further reduce float like so 42337m 4m 38337m now are my assumptions legit well theordore aka the goat agrees see his comment in the 13g he filed this week x200b quote based on june 30th 13f filings very few of avaya s institutional shareholders have reported reductions in their share holding i also back up what i say without relying on theodore aka da gawd 10 holders of any stock have to file within 2days of any transaction given that we haven t seen these filings would say float is less than what s reported for the two 8 holders they would need to file if that level drops below 5 which they have not yet of the 5 holders who collectively have 50 of shares outstanding 2 of them own around 10 and the other 10 hence the 4233m float number i have show justification for 4233m 4m 38337m float calculation based on the new ceo compensation and stipulations in the contract why does this matter well you can read theo s letter and get a sense of where his mind is at in terms of the shorts x200b however note that official short interest is 1524m so essentially i m saying avaya is 40 shorted estimated si is at 2035 so probably around 50 shorted tbh x200b further this is relatively new as institutions and theo have been loading in the past 2months theodore aka money bags mcgee actually bought 18m shares in the last two weeks the price action is starting to show the lack of liquidity we see barcoding x200b x200b we see wild fluctuations in the ctb x200b average ctb ran from 3 yesterday to 109 today then ended at 1351 ctb max is now at 27188 two days ago this was at 6 x200b can also see that shares available basically at 0 yesterday over 2million shares available so maybe theo the oracle is right about the synthetic shares and ftds and maybe we are on to something x200b btw here s the ceo s interview about his plans to turnaround avaya clearly from his compensation letter he has a strong incentive to see the price go boom boom made a mistake in my calculations edited whats the mistake prn according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise in theodores letter he states $341 is the strike but they can t convert until oct 1 these guys hedge so they are the ones getting squeezed rn they can t convert notes to cover the shorts lol sheesh the setup is wild x200b anyway i excluded these guys from the float calculations and included firms that own 5 of shares to come to a lower number around so around 40 of shares are shorted and possibly if we include the estimated short interest now 50 so i edited the post to include the correct calculations and will be going back to edit the others

palantears ahoy pltr was a bit of a gang here for a while it was 40 ish then now it s tickling the low teens i still like the stock and have started dca ing into it have about 100 shares atm wanted to get the community s take and maybe restart a lookdiscussion about this stock there are various bears and bulls on it i watch a russian the good kind not the war crimes kind ex financial analyst guy on yt who loves it and a thrupple of dudes who have their own stock valuation tool that seems to make sense and they are pretty bearish cant link not allowed with the amount of gov spend on this company and a hopefully real mote protecting their tech from being copied as well as an aggressive stock based comp policy bad for stock price short term i know to retain the super smart people that normally got wooed by zuckerberg into making tracking breadcrumbs or whatever the fuck that zaney android is up to nowadays from what i understand pltr might one day be skynet but right now its value is that it can save you money by streamlining your supply chain for gov and corp lets just pretend those are separate things for the sake of sanity and this discussion this can make incremental savings which add up to massive cost saving measures which is pretty sexy in an inflationary world that has most of its supply chains destabilized by rona winnie the pooh killing his nations irrational and corrupt building industry and our brand new flavor war in europe i guess i want to know if anyone else is still long pltr at a 70ish discount off ath it might be a good entry point now or soon if it keeps dropping with the market this ain t no rocket but it might be an interplanetary bus one day

bet on war $gd $ldos with upcoming earning coming up for $gd and $ldos defense stocks will skyrocket the ukrainian president has announced today that he is calling off the ceasefire and requesting more aid the huge game changer for the defense sector is once earnings are reported they will provide guidance on how much money they are being allocated for these contracts historically defense stocks outperform the market in times of conflict after most earnings for defense stocks come out by end of may you will see a huge rise in speculative pricing once these guidance are given positions are here all of my positions correlate after earnings so you have an idea of the strike to look at this will honestly only fail if the ukraine has peace by early may which is highly unlikely as global spending on defense has never been higher in the past 10 years

long oil short pp i have a bullish thesis on crude oil i think the reason crude oil has dropped from its high is because grandpa biden is releasing millions of barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve spr to reduce the cost of fuel and therefore inflation leading into the november midterm elections the problem come december peak oil consumption season as people fly and drive for christmas oil prices may spike again also the more the spr reduces the more demand increases as capacity needs to be restored for national security reasons x200b not to mention fossil fuel capex is still insufficient as the industry does not want to invest in a dying product this is what happens when you demonise a resource that you still need x200b my question where can i find more information relating to spr inventory levels i think the key to understanding what happens to oil prices lies in betterunderstanding spr inventory levels i honestly think oil prices are artificially depressed until the november midterms after that all hell will break loose x200b bottomline supplydemand fundamentals in the oil market have not improved as such the main reason oil prices have reduced is because of spr supply increases that will eventually runout x200b i am an oil man now x200b as always mod me

reddit s1 filing when can we see it i thought they already filed it but can t find it i haven t done the deep dive on the stock valuation but this will be the most lit s1 filing i have ever seen in case you don t know what the s1 filing represents it is the shopping around of the business to get investment and sell shares most insiders will have a lock up period to sell so you get a nice rally on the first day investment banks get the first taste and then if you are an executive in the lock up period you can sell later just looking forward to what they disclose on the model this will be a fun one cheers

a recession at this stage is almost inevitable former fed vice chair roger ferguson current high inflation is due to money printing and lack of production of goods during covid and high demand since then they can raise interests but they will also hurt companies trying to recover their production output to prepandemic levels also the dollar is already in history highs markets have already priced in interests hikes
rate hikes actual affect on large successful companies shouldn t large and successful companies not be hindered too much by rate hikes could big companies survive even continue to thrive the next few years without borrowing another dime plus wouldn t they have taken advantage of such a time when interest rates were low they have more equity than ever to keep moving forward this just hurts the small businesses in the end and makes competition even harder for any potential competitor to grow against giants in theory which should make buying blue chip stocks even more appealing right contrary to this thought process i could understand how larger companies do need to borrow more money for their balance sheet but this doesn t necessarily impose more risk from them being unsuccessful it would just cut into profits but not like that should mean much for shareholders when the only profit s they ll ever see are rises in share price unless you re already loaded and hold a bunch of divies they don t really pay for shit let s be honest so selling equities at anytime would just be a net loss in the long run hypothetically seems like the market over reacting just to catch profits on volatility
spy strategy idea spy is a broad market fund comprised of the largest companies in the us as such it generally just goes up and is subject to the macroeconomy at a fundamental level just a handful of megacap companies have a massive influence these stocks are called faaaaaang stocks because they are fucking cool and the acronym just is so so dope after years of judicious study i have noticed a trend which i will now share with you spy tends to go up over time as i mentioned but sometimes spy goes down for example when interest rates go up spy goes down pretty frequently spy goes up when someone says the word ai which is happening more and more lately because terminator and the matrix is available on many streaming services netflix is part of spy which is almost market manipulation because they show lots of scifi shows on there and many of them have robots which as you know is ai since spy goes up sometimes and down sometimes i have devised a strategy which i think is basically fool proof the strategy since spy generally goes up over long periods of time i am planning on buying leap calls on spy assuming an annual growth of around 10 since jpow sometimes feels cranky and increases interest rates i am planning on buying shorter dated puts itm two months out after spy goes up by at least 15 on any given day for example looking at the option chain and the ticker spy is trading at around $447 assuming 10 growth per year spy should be $491 by september in 2024 $536 by 2025 i believe a safe leap would be the december 2025 call on spy at $475 if it reaches $491 by that time which based on my forecast it definitely probably maybe likely could i would net negative $2463 per contract now to hedge my bet and profit off of the volatility i intend to also purchase spy puts dated out by two months which are itm if spy falls by just 1 before the end of october i will net a loss of around $116 in profit based on these figures i will have made negative $2463 on my leap options minus the $116 in profit i make meaning i will be ahead in the negative by over $2k can you think of any downside to this play

past yolo generally succeeded on aal volatility all year now too terrified to touch it further x200b i ve gone most of this year casually buying and selling options as well as periodically holding shares when the opportunity arose of aal american airlines due to the seemingly high volatility and consistency of the stock always rising and falling quite a bit with the market but staying within roughly the same bounds a bit ago it shot up to $1415 a share when my target ideal buy price before then was consistently somewhere around 121270 it seems stuck up there until the market cools down and i now have to looks elsewhere for consistent returns it s a shame my lifestyle right now is modest and i ve effectively lived off this income since april diamondhands during that big drop in the middle btw i was selling put options that were absolutely certain not to execute at the time so i laughed knowing there were a few weeks left yolo proof x200b x200b x200b anyways some a lot of the intermediate positions may have been odd generally whichever direction the market seemed to be heading if it just spiked down i m betting it s rubber banding up etc i d sellbuy options for if it dipped down into a certain range i d start buying up shares if it was comfortable has been a fun streak but i think i m cold now and stuck holding cash i liked the stock x200b
frc self bailout in their 10k didn t they say they have 30bn of variable loans and 70bn of hybrids doesn t that mean 100bn of their loans can be sold close to book value am i missing something here so if the plan is to get 8090bn back by selling these off and repaying the 5 interest fed loans it can effectively stop the bleed they would only be paying interest on 20bn which is 1bn year problem is they d be left with shitty 2 loans that only yield 14 bn a year plus their wealth mngmt bringing in 8 bn realistically they need to cut more than half of their operations to reign in costs to 15bn the problem is bad but not that bad right they d be looking at a loss of 51bn a year until they can figure something out

weekly recap week ended jun 9 2023 market rotation might be happening marketmoving news the fight against inflation is not over the bank of canada raised the policy rate by 25 basis points to 475 and ecb is hinting another hike might be necessary good reminders that the fight against inflation is not over meanwhile back in the us the fed had gone silent this week before the fomc meeting next week the market has largely priced in a pause in june given the goldilocks economic data in the past month it is unlikely for the fed to surprise the market with either more hawkish or dovish languages at the meeting on the other hand china and japan are continuing their loose credit policies as these countries worry more about deflation rather than inflation as for liquidity we know tga will be refilled and we know the fed is on track with qt and both are bad for the market so rrp is the most important thing to watch here rrp declined this week but in small amounts tga increase is also small so the total liquidity proxy mostly decreased due to fed qt a small divergence appeared between liquidity and sp 500 performance i will continue to monitor if liquidity is indeed on a declining trend which could be toxic for the market weekly summary of inflation news summary from previous weeks divergence appeared between liquidity and market performance rrp is the key to watch as it will determine liquidity change in h2 us and global economy not a lot of data this week but sentiment is lifted from betterthanexpected pmi and world bank raising 2023 economic growth forecast ism and sp

spx about to hit lower high channel open discussion what happens when spx breaks out of the upper high channel obviously it can go up down or sideways i d say if we break 4300 we are not in a bear market any more the channel seems predictable which would put us around 4080 to 4154 where we would see the downturn important to note the previous downturns were all big drops spx daily with fibs x200b spx weekly another thing i wanted to point out is the vix is nearing a low in its channel too x200b one could surmise that waiting for the vix to touch the bottom channel line set an alert would signal the time for reversal i think this is the obvious play as i am smoothly regarded brain chimp most likely the hfc ai trading systems already priced this in and if i enter a position based on the above i will surely loose everything x200b thanks for letting me share
some advice for the bbby well well well history repeats itself and i see another wave of bagholders well as a fellow wsb tard here are some advice for you dumb shits so maybe y all will lose less money in the future here are the 4 most sacred rules of wsb 1 there is no we in trading no shit there s only an i trading investing lol let s be honest no one do that here gambling see anything common yes they all got an i cuz this shit is essentially a zero some game buy low sell high to the next retard rinse and repeat this applies to all stocks etfs wtvoptions are different those are buy high sell worthless the only difference is who the retards are in the case of gme citadel ate a bag of shit by selling low and buying high in bbby you tards shouting hold and buy and to the moon essential bought high from cohen lol even if the stocks do moon if you don t cash it out it s worth shit better pray you can cash it out to the fomo ppl probably why ppl can write pages long dd hyping the stock they already bought low and need to convince you to buy it from them name of the game move the money from the retards pocket to your pocket 2 trust no one literally trust no dd trust no billionaire trust no news outlet trust no government don t trust me don t even trust yourself why there s no free lunch in the world as i said it s a zero sum game hedgies can hire ppl to write shit in reddit to pump the stock the people who writes the dd obviously already bought the stock by the time you read it it s probably late you might ride it up and profit along the way but ultimately they got a much lower cost basis than you do and can afford to sell their shit earlier add on you guys think billionaires like ryan are on your side you mad all the rich ppl didn t get rich by being kind and generous they are all ruthless businessmen there s a higher chance of you getting screwed by them before they even help you poors lol 3 sticking it to the hedgies lol what can i say you guys know hedge funds aren t all just short stuff right and they certainly don t work in coordination with each other for wtv hedgefund that s shorting shit you can bet there s another one going long they re all trying to screw each other the only difference between the hedgies that go long and you retards is that they know when to sell while you dumbos just ride it up and back down 4 inverse wsb yup the unspoken rule the most important one the one that even if you ignore all the rest of it and just work on this rule you ll loose less money you might not make any money still but at least you loose less eg when wsb was in full retard mode when bbby was 30 if you bought puts you d be in the green ok maybe not cause of the high iv but at least you lose less that s all folks happy wsb experience also you might be wondering by would i bother to write this must be a hedge fund shill lol no as i said there s no free lunch writing this encourages y all to stay here so that i can inverse you lot p jk
bbby trading halt on tuesday with the suicide of the cfo this weekend who was being investigated will it lead to a trading halt on tuesday so what do you think yes or no
the 20 year old who sold $110 million worth of bbby did an interview and apparently is not to fond of us here at wsb the now financially free man himself jake freeman the 20 year old nephew of a hedge fund manager who made over $80 million on a bbbu play just did an news interview you can find an article with highlights here and the full audio of the interview in this twitter link here of particular note he states that he is taken aback by the visceral responses and strongly opinionated responses from the reddit community the article further states that freeman hinted that he didn t make an activist play at bed bath beyond because ryan cohen the activist investor and gamestop chairman was already pushing for changes at the company to which freeman stated there is a phrase too many cooks in the kitchen to which i say obviously mr freeman just got lucky on making a large investment with his investor s obviously his uncle s money and had utterly no idea what he was actually doing for if he truly believed that cohen was pushing for changes at the company why would he have bailed before cohen actually implemented those changes the answer is of course that i m sure freeman realized that making $85 million off of someone else s money is not half bad when your 20 years old and in college despite freeman s inane commentary there is a good lesson to be learned here if your wild yolo of a play finally does pay out and you see yourself with a nice pile of gains sell you can t spend the money if you don t take the money

earnings express with a $4098 billion loss in the first three quarters apple tied up buffett loss is the key word throughout the us stock market in 2022 since the beginning of this year as federal reserve continued to raise interest rates a number of rich people have suffered varying degrees of decline in their wealth including buffett x200b recently buffett company berkshire hathaway reported thirdquarter earnings with revenue of $76934 billion up 9 from $70583 billion in the same period last year net loss of $2688 billion compared with a profit of $10344 billion in the same period last year but was sharply narrower than the $43755 billion loss in the second quarter for the full year revenue for the first three quarters of 2022 was $223924 billion up slightly from last year s $204296 billion but it lost $40983 billion in the first three quarters of this year compared with a profit of $50149 billion in the same period last year due to a poor investment environment judging from buffett performance this year it s not so bad as early as the first quarter of this year in fact buffett is still bucking the trend of growth he changed his regular strategy for the past 5 years and increased the intensity of investment in total buffett bought $518 billion of shares in the first quarter and sold $103 billion according to his earnings report his cash pile fell from $1439 billion to $1027 billion at the end of the quarter after the general direction was set in the first quarter its position has been small changes more persistent is to continue to buy western oil specifically berkshire lost $13465 billion on investments and derivatives contracts in the third quarter bringing its losses to $82362 billion in the first three quarters x200b in terms of total holdings berkshire s market value is $306167 billion so far compared with $350 719 billion at the same time last year that represents a decline of about $50 billion over the course of a year the changes in the market value of these positions are not from losses caused by active adjustments but losses caused by passive declines in the stocks they hold according to the earnings report berkshire s top five holdings were unchanged as follows first apple with a market capitalization of $1265 billion according to statistics so far this year apple s stock price has fallen by 2103 from the perspective of position contribution apple s position has contributed more than half of the loss limit second bank of america with $312 billion in market value bank of america is down 1537 for the year third chevron with a market capitalization of $244 billion although it rose 6389 in the year but the overall position is small the impact on the entire position is not big fourth cocacola with an open position of $224 billion this year s increase of 295 it is reported that this has been the fourteen consecutive years of cocacola increase fifth american express with an open position of $205 billion it was down 706 for the year in terms of overall holdings berkshire s major investment losses are from apple stock so over time for buffett he will focus more on operating profit berkshire reported operating income of $7761 billion in the third quarter compared with $6466 billion in the same period last year operating income for the first three quarters was $24084 billion compared with $2017 billion in the same period last year on that measure buffett still beats the market by a wide margin x200b in addition the dow jones industrial average is down 874 this year while berkshire hathaway a is down just 19 so berkshire is also beating the index the results also showed that berkshire still had $109 billion in cash on its books at the end of the third quarter a slight increase from $1054 billion in the previous quarter taken together the big cash flow on berkshire s books is still a reflection of the market s weakness and while buffett has been buying occidental oil all year it s not enough to change buffett overall position structure berkshire s earnings are likely to be tied to apple s stock for a long time to come until berkshire breaks its structure and realigns its position

21023 spy es futures and tesla weekly market analysis and recap we finally got cpi consensus this morning and so far looks like we could get a cpi yoy beat core cpi mom miss big one and core yoy unchanged to miss i will post later this weekend my analysis for all of that x200b taking a look at the daily here i suspected that we would after failing to do so yesterday come down and touch this 4053 support now i did fully expect this to continue lower into that 400402 area today however incredibly we actually saw a ton of strength off that 4053 today and i dare say that monday this is likely to see a close back between 4106 to 4144 leading into cpi cpi will absolutely be the deciding factor of 430 or 390 next x200b a few interesting things to note here on the weekly we have that range bound red channel i have been talking about that we did actually lose support of this week and did close below now we also broke the 7 week long bull channel support also those two things there do show that this rally is quickly losing steam however if we were to see a good cpi print that could trump that technical if there was no cpi next week i would feel highly confident in 3060dte spy puts back to 390400 support area however as i have said there is no reason to be long or short on spy until cpi is over with now something else to note and i believe i started talking about this back in december is that the 7th week post jpm collar roll generally speaking is the top of that current trend and then from weeks 7 to 11 we see a relief one way or the other that would mean next week very well could be the top of the market cycle here and we could see a relief drop back to that 390400 support area we could do that and still actually remain bullish overall as long as markets hold 390and we don t get extremely negative catalysts then i would remain bullish overall however for me to go long again and feel confident in a longer dte 3060dte play i really need to see a pullback to at least 400 to make the risk to reward worthwhile there is not much to say this week just because cpi is likely to be a wild card and a big move up or down and the resulting days are likely to do the same until the weekly candle settles next friday we don t know what to expect next next friday we will have a much clearer picture of a push to 430 or a drop to 390 key weekly spy support 3984 390 key weekly spy resistance 4088 417 4275 x200b based strictly off the futures daily candle i actually am very bullish when factoring in the vix too for monday i really do expect this daily 20ema support retest and 40854095 support test to turn into a very bullish situation for markets monday i expect us to close out somewhere in that 41304145 area this is a really nice daily reversal doji candle i will not be surprised to see a push up monday bulls defending this 4095 area was a very big deal x200b slightly different structure here on futures weekly we actually did hold the weekly 8 week long bull channel support we did not break through that which overall send a bit more of a bullish picture plus we are closing over the critical 4095 support level presumptively here on futures bulls defending this 4095 level is a really big deal again not much to say here until we get through cpi next week and see where we end up key futures weekly support 4095 4075 4020 3970 key futures weekly resistance 4150 4220 x200b what truly is incredible tesla and nvidia both closed extremely red today kinda ironic that the last 2 weeks of spy struggling at times with tesla straight ripping it finally took a huge hit today however as crazy as it sounds and with absolutely zero chance of me playing it the daily chart is bullish so yes we did break the rising wedge support again however we came down and had a huge bounce off the daily 8ema and also retook that key 1969 area this looks like it could definitely turn into a more bullish movement on tesla for monday again cpi is tuesday and that could very well be a market mover so no reason to trade this or speculate past monday x200b now on the otherhand tesla weekly chart is 100 bearish of course this is where short term vs long term differs so we had a huge push up and a massive rejection up in the 200s and then closed back under 200 the weekly candle structure is a very large gravestone doji reversal candle actually similar in setup to what we saw yesterday on the daily structure minus the gap up we also closed over the weekly 200ema for the first time since beginning of november however if you look back to that november time period you can see that much like the daily 200ema on stocks there is not usually a straight break through the 200ema we could definitely see a pullback on tesla next week to that 180 support area key weekly tesla support 1899 1784 1677 key weekly tesla resistance 1974 2084 2285 x200b classic vix here so we had a two day pretty large 11 total pump on the vix however after another massive opening and push to 2194 the highest level since january 10th the vix unwound all day long and ended up closing a massive evening doji star reversal pattern now i have said this before when spy and vix have opposing patterns in congruence of the same thing there is a very high probability of a play panning out for us i did recommend swinging spy calls however i decided to sit cash the only reason i didn t take calls here is that with cpi on tuesday we could absolutely get a huge rogue spike on the vix the risk to reward for calls is there but i don t put it past the markets to suddenly care again over the weekend remember cash is a position if it wasn t for cpi i would have 100 taken them weekly log x200b overall this was such a blah week pre fomc cpi weeks are also so tough because we have premiums so incredibly high on all 38dte that you need such a bigger move than usual just to see profits most of this week the profits i got would have been double if premiums iv were not so elevated also got burnt a few times playing the wrong bias overall was able to savage the week with some extreme confident larger than normal swing trades for today that played out well overall not my best week not my worst week i really look forward to cpi being over with and being able to trade this well again btw early prediction here cpi yoy beat cpi mom miss core yoy miss core mom miss market reaction red

activity from insiders of the company from all departments biggest drop of shares come from the ceo itself swot analysis strengths most valuable automotive company it is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation tesla increased its electric vehicle delivery in 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40 from 935 thousands to 13 million units crosssell and diversification tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with liberty mutual insurance company innovative company tesla has a very high rate of innovation the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products weaknesses manufacturing complications tesla faces continuous launch manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products for example tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch model x which lead to constant delays for distribution similarly the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing model x s battery module assembly line at gigafactory 1 unable to meet demand might affect brand value due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures tesla might face an unbalanced supply and demand unable to meet the production ramp lack of high volume production it has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models even now as the company plans to manufacture model 3 vehicles at high volume it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources shortage of batteries the shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems elon musk as tesla s sole representative musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests financial uncertainty tesla has outstanding debt of $538 billion if the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt then there is a risk of delaying expansion reducing investments selling assets etc employee safety concerns tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection also the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching california s heat leadership wrangles friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and longterm success tesla s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles tesla faces lawsuit over sexual misconduct many tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace the women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct they also alleged that they were catcalled and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks groping and misogynistic behaviour opportunities sales expansion in untapped market the most significant opportunity for the company right now is the asian market even tho there are increased risks less expensive car tesla s model 3 is a more affordable version of model s with less range power and fewer features bringing battery production technology inhouse tesla intends to make its own battery cells market confidence in tesla the stock market has shown confidence in tesla after beating the projected car deliveries threats product liability claims the company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products if these liability claims continued then tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks extensive competition tesla inc faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles hybrid plugin hybrid fully electric car and selfdriving technology many automotive brands in the luxury segment like mercedes bmw audi lexus and in the economy segment like toyota ford general motors volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environmentfriendlyselfdriving technology but also they are offering them at a comparably lower price product defects tesla s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases the defective products often have weaknesses in design manufacturing and other features which harm the company s image permanently long term confidence tesla due to its unstable manufacturing conditions suffers from disbelief among the public about its longterm existence which can result in a deficiency in further business development customer adaptation the company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles disruption of supply due to shortage of materials tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices the company uses aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers all these materials have volatile prices which can affect the company s production line severely in the future highrisk factor due to usage of lithiumion tesla uses lithiumion cells in their battery packs lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element which increases the risk factor of our products tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke which has defamed the company on a major level elon musk s behavior affecting tesla s reputation tesla s entire reputation is built upon the cult of elon musk but recently his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting tesla competitors increasing productions of ev vehicles competitors are jumping in the ev segment eating huge portions of the

has the little cardboard that could intro welcome to yet another rad dd today s topic is hasbro for those unaware hasbro is a toy company that makes many products including nerf my little pony transformers playdoh monopoly gijoe and wizards of the coast who own dungeons dragons and magic the gathering this is going to focus on the entire company but out of all these products wizards of the coast is the money printer for hasbro specifically magic the gathering which accounts for 18 of their yearly revenue honestly if hasbro ever spun off just the wizards of the coast part of the company i would be all in as that s crazy profitable but other parts make money too let s begin boring numbers and stuff alright this is where all the numbers and graphs are going if you hate that section skip ahead but it s also a key part of the data set you should learn to read if you want to get into a company as of the writing of this dd has has a market cap of $77 billion a share price of $5461 and pays a 499 dividend which will be $070share with an exdividend date of october 31st and a payment date of november 15th they also have a forward pe of 1121 according to yahoo finance so fair value for this type of company for comparison mattel their closest competitor and maker of products like hot wheels and barbie has a forward pe of 1493 so on paper you re getting better valueshare as of their last earnings on june 30th their quarterly revenue was $121 billion a 965 decline yearoveryear and their 2022 revenue was $5565 billion a 1419 decline yearoveryear here s a 1year chart for those of you who like crayons i m not doing crayon stuff on this but if you want it here it is x200b x200b now i m sure if you have a brain you re probably asking why i m bringing up a company showing a near 15 yearly decline and 10 quarterly decline yearonyear no i m not that stupid there s a reason and the reason is because despite the numbers above this quarter has has been doing something big they ve been making a lot of money correcting mistakes one of the big issues has had that s hurt their bottom line they bought up a bunch of companies that lost them money in 2019 they purchased eone entertainment studios for $4 billion the studio has been a real loser for them last october eone saw their revenue fall 34 to $2116 million from $3271 million the year before not a great return on a $4 billion purchase but has has been fixing these issues in one key way they re selling off the trash lionsgate agreed to purchase eone from has for $500 million this year with a sale date some time early next year yes that s a terrible return spending $4 billion just to sell it for $500 million 4 years later a very wsb return really but they re getting a bad asset off the books and that s the important thing they messed up but they re trying to correct it and fix their bottom line now again this probably doesn t sound bullish you might even be wondering why i m bringing up this bad stuff at all well it s because that s what honest dd is folks too many people only put up the good news then try to hide things like this in a 12 sentence write off at the end of their long dd but i m not doing that i m giving you a fair dd and that means i m going to highlight the shit along with the gold ok so what s even good alright bulls now we can get into the good stuff and the reason i m bullish on has as i said before right now they re making money but let s get specific by looking at some of their revenue sources that kicked off too late to be reported in their q2 earnings but will be reflected in their upcoming q3 earnings this thursday october 23rd premarket monopoly go monopoly go is a phone app with in app purchases it released in april of 2023 and was too new at the time to include in their q2 earning revenue reported on june 30th but this little app has been making them money in june has pointed out monopoly go was the top grossing app on the us apple store yes top grossing over everything but that wasn t just some shortterm fluke today monopoly go is the 3rd grossing app on the us apple store behind only tiktok and youtube and for those who don t know these apps make money from april to august of this year monopoly go generated $200 million in revenue while it is unknown how much of that has gets bank of america has estimated has will earn around $60 million in royalties if monopoly go can earn $500 million in revenue so if we want to math it out they ve made around $24 mil so far from the app which isn t even a major part of their business just a bonus and this assumes they ve not made any money since august 22nd despite maintaining a place in the top 3 grossing apps on the us apple store baldur s gate 3 monopoly go isn t the only ip has is collecting royalties from the incredibly popular video game baldur s gate 3 uses has ip through their dungeons dragons ip and for those who don t know this game is selling like crazy in the same article above bank of america estimated has would receive royalties of around $60 million if baldur s gate 3 could sell 10 million copies to date they have sold just over 11 million copies on steam just steam not including other digital pc sales or their sales on the playstation 5 now while playstation sales numbers are hard to find what i can give is this the game launched in september on playstation 5 and was the 2nd highest downloaded game on the system usually the top console spots are all sports games but baldur s gate 3 managed to take second just behind nba 2k24 in the us and ea sports fc 24 in the eu better known as fifa now i can t tell you how many downloads that is or the revenue it translates to playstation hasn t released those numbers but it s going to be another nice chunk of change for has as another revenue source they weren t especially relying on like monopoly go magic the gathering time to discuss the real cash cow of has and the thing that got me to investigate the company in the first place for those unaware magic the gathering is a collectable card game like yugioh or pokmon cards well it s unfair to say it is a collectable card game really magic the gathering is the collectable card game every other collectable card game wishes they could be magic the gathering constantly fighting to get a piece of their market share last year magic the gathering alone accounted for $11 billion in revenue but along with magic the gathering normally making a lot of money something special happened last quarter in april 2023 too late for has to include in their q2 revenue magic the gathering had a crossover set with lord of the rings and the set was a massive hit how massive in their q2 earnings has stated they anticipate the lord of the rings crossover to be their highest earning magic the gathering set ever within 8 months yes folks the most profitable section of this business is about to report out 6 months worth of revenue from their anticipated most popular selling set of all time and if you re wondering those sales have not been slowing down without getting too deep into the game itself i ll keep it simple and say the set is both popular because it s lord of the rings and nerds want legolas on a card but also because it introduced 2 very powerful cards people need to get if they want to play and this isn t just speculation at the time of the q2 earnings packs of these cards were selling with a 20 markup due to popularity and demand and selling out despite the extra cost but there s more still not only did they do a crossover with lord of the rings just two weeks ago has released another magic the gathering crossover but this time with dr who now if you re not familiar dr who is a popular british science fiction show spanning nearly 70 years and like i said before nerds love that type of stuff it s way too new to give sales information but i expect this to be included in forward guidance and probably highlighted as a major positive for next quarter s revenue earnings based on what i just highlighted above i expect their earnings this thursday premarket to be very strong has is about to inform the market they ve spent the last quarter making a lot of money and with rates this high being a company with a good cash flow is exactly the company you want to be especially one that also pays a dividend yes it s boring but dividends bring in investors last quarter has had an eps of 049 this quarter they are expected to have an eps of $169 now that s a nice jump now maybe you re going to say but look at that projected eps jump surely it s been priced in well look at the chart below and you tell me does that look priced in for a more than 3x eps move x200b right now the stock price is under what it was when they reported in june yes september saw a nice jump but that jump is gone and it s being priced back below where it was this doesn t look like company pricing in 3x growth quarter over quarter and this isn t just me bank of america raised has twice in july with a price target of $85and they re saying the same things i said above not just that but those who know me can vouch i was saying all this back in may well before bank of america came out with their upgrades does this make me some super genius no i m a stupid nerd who likes cardboard and realized if it s selling well then the company must be making money but based on all this above i fully expect has to come out this thursday morning confirm their eps maybe even beat off the back of baldur s gate 3 and monopoly go and the market to wake up and reprice the stock based on all the cash they re about to show they have so what s the play well the play is simple buy shares and hold through earnings or if you want to go get calls either way i expect has to have another nice earnings jump as once again people are reminded that this is a company making a lot of money in a high interest rate environment that s paying a nice dividend to boot myself i already have shares and i plan to hold onto them for a while as they keep making money tldr has made a lot of money last quarter and while they re expected to have good earnings the stock price is not reflecting that earnings are thursday premarket and i expect once the numbers hit and people see how much cash they ve made the stock will be revalued and go up positions 40 shares yeah boring but that s me i m boring go yolo or don t whatever

pulte homes is going to tank by the next earnings call pulte homes stock will tank and there is shocking evidence to why there stock continued to go up in 2022 due to strong margins 2021 264 2022 297 while their units sold only went up 1 2021 28 894 2022 29 111 margin squeeze so margins were the only thing keeping them propped up but that s now gone they stated in their ars annual report to shareholders they made the decision to intelligently find the market clearing price using incentives andor other price adjustments this is saying hey we don t have demand so no more high margins building more unsold homes they are also increasing their spec home homes built in hopes someone buys before completion from 3035 to 3545 saying given current market dynamics and interest volatility homebuyers want to shorten the period between contract signing and home completion so we made the decision to increase production of spec homes to better meet buyer preference however there are programs where you can lock your rate up to 280 days 9 months so interest volatility isn t the problem and when buying a new home a customer typically wants to select how it looks they are doing this in hopes they can try and save on margin with faster turn around times but they lose it on incentives here are a couple more scary states cancellation rate 2021 9 2022 19 homes in production as of dec 31 unsold under construction 2021 4 105 2022 6 874 completed 2021 90 2022 982 this is crazy at the end of the year in 2022 they had over 10x as many homes completed and still unsold plus they have almost double under construction lastly two anecdotal pieces a buddy of mine was working for them in one of their biggest developments and got let go in january also my wife works in sales for a builder and their sells have plummeted again anecdotal what do you think would be the argument for them being okay

friend getting laid off shitposting heals what happens in a recession as interest rates go up and the federal reserve prepares to unload the lowest quality securities starting in june one may start looking at a recession as a more likely scenario realistically the above paragraph may look quite optimistic depending on when you read it the goal of this essay is to evaluate what happens during a recession and if people are so inclined to direct blame should it be necessary daddy powell while the most obvious place to start is the fed specifically the fed rising interest rates i pose that this is attributing too much power to the institution on this particular economic lever the only rate the fed has power over is the overnight lending rate aka the fed rate this is a rate at which bankslarge financial institutions are allowed to exchange money this rate is associated with shortterm borrowing rates but has no major implication on the economy even though it may appear otherwise all the rates that impact the economy are market rates meaning that they are based on the supply and demand dynamics of participants the long term lending and mortgage rates are all based on what creditors demand vs what debtors can afford the basis for someone to lend money is that they have to demand a return higher than what they think is the inflation rate a premium for the risk of the investment if inflation is 3 and the risk of an investment is 2 then lenders will ask for a 5 annual rate unless they are forcedsubsidized which has limited applicability because it would create inflation a lender will refrain from giving credit below the inflation rate this means that no matter what the fed says when banks pick up that there is inflation in the economy they will raise rates in some backwater regions like the eu banks can t really raise rates so they increase fees and settlement expenses etc it s interest they just can t call it that we have already seen this unfold the long term lending rates started going up irrespective of fed policy these are the rates at which credit is lent to corporations and at which equity investors estimate the value of stocks us market rates for inflation fred these are the rates that matter you feel the 10year rate if you are an equity investor because that is mostly why stocks have been going down you feel a version of the corporate bond rate because refinancing your term loans just got twice as expensive now i have to make it personal as this is one of the big whys in the essay you feel the 30year fixed mortgage rate because now you have to pay more of your income towards financing your home if you used a floating rate your current payments will also increase this makes renting more expensive and affording a home even harder but here is where things get ugly for people imagine a ceo of some company and you need to deliver on growth now in order to grow your company needs to spend it needs to hire sales people most of these new words people have been using to describe themselves on linkedin are nothing but sales to hire developers and testers more hr because workers are hard to source more workers just to make sure the competition doesn t get a leg up etc basically your company is was in spending mode so how does a companyceo decide how much to spend and on the other side where does it get the money a company can raise money from credit a loan or equity selling parts of the company to investors that s it so the ceo negotiates with both debt and equity investors to get financing and grow as fast as possible a ceo can t really decide not to grow else they risk being overtaken by the competition there are exceptions but this is the general approach but wait can t a company just finance its own business the short answer is no the tax law in most countries stimulates credit and penalizes companies if they don t get financing the investors need to make a return on the investment so they ask for a rate now here is the problem investors can t ask for a rate that is reflecting the true risk of a business unless that is close to the market rate for example if a company has 5 risk but the market is willing to give them a loan or buy their shares at a 1 rate then investors have to also offer a 1 rate else their cash will be wasted but what did we just witness a business has 5 risk but got a loan for 1 where did the other 4 go nowhere they are still in the business it is just as risky even though investors cut down on the rates you say so what well now the ceo can be lazy or imprudent and will be ok as long as he delivers a 1 return to investors which means that he takes easier projects can be laid back at work hires off the cuff work is portrayed as a fun activity etc but then we arrive at our situation where the over stimulation of money led to inflation and suddenly the script flips investors now have to demand a 5 return the inflation of 3 a nice fat 8 and what once was a boom now has to overcorrect instead of having small ups and downs around the true risk rate for companies we now have a big cycle of an artificial boom which is over and a large tightening the bust every low return project has to suddenly make large returns or be cut it s that simple ceos will start firing whole departments selling off divisions to the competition and reducing wages businesses that once thought they were the bomb will go bust unless hard cash flows into the bank thus there will be a lot of pain in markets and at home everyone is going to be affected in a sense what the fed claims to be part of their strategy has nothing to do with raising rates the market raises rates as austrian economists posit the problem begins when the fed injects money into the economy everything else is just a symptom summary inflation is caused by the amount of wealth dilution by the central authority or the amount of printed money in the easy times companies had to produce a return of 1 to investors so people got hired and rich now those same companies have to overproduce to make up for all the bad decisions they made and make a return of 8 figuratively people suffer the labor market $wen we are very sorry to let you go what happens to working people from here as mentioned a lot of projects and whole companies will end up being cut anything that cannot deliver more than the inflation rate will need to go under for those imagining alternatives no a pay cut won t be enough from a company s point of view a losing project is being cut the layoffs are a consequence since most of the companies will find themselves operating on the brink employees will be lucky if they are notified a few months in advance that they are getting fired while their company scrambles to make the barely profitable segments into actually profitable what about professions highly skilled and educated jobs are safe the skilled workers will be safe or easily rotated because they can produce more the educated workers will be kept at the expense of the skilled because hr has to cover their hiring decisions let s put it practically if an mba messes up it s their fault but if a skilled worker messes up while working in an mba s position well then hr messed up for making the hire so doctors engineers mathematicians backend engineers etc are likely safe or will find another job soon for the rest there will be a rotation here is how that may look sales unashamedly becomes top priority it always was people will be induced to call friends relatives product shill etc to make the extra close both good products and scams will be amplified managers will start calling back those people they once told to take a walk and the phone will be answered because the other guy

the bus and practicing them with your work buddy on the weekend oh and side note violence and revolt get amplified at the workplace things will also change people start coming on time people start working late this is sad as most people are actually hardworking already now it s about to affect family life a strict hierarchy will be naturally established managers will be disciplined and treated with extra curtsy not because they hold power but because everyone depends on them to keep the operation afloat cheating backstabbing and looking for alternative ways to get ahead will become commonplace summary as the economy tightens people must switch from pretending to be productive to actually being productive laid off workers will only be offered jobs where they can actually be productive which may involve more manual labor or late nights at the start of the article i mentioned that there is appropriate blame to levy at someone here it is financiers can lend at the lowest bid rate and excluding fraud there is nothing they can do to change this to the extent that politicians have short term horizons they will make decisions to maximize that utility which involves intervening in the fragile and dangerous dynamics of the market subsidies and quantitative easing make creditrates cheaper but ultimately politics is downstream from culture and if people don t want to be productive and skim from society then this happens sooner or later i don t know anyone that has been able to solve this problem yet while many have tried in fact when i think about it thus far the most effective attempt to maximize the long term prosperity of people vs short term consumption has most likely been religion the core tenets not the perversions and corruptions what happens when

are we in a student loan bubble hey y all so i need some advice basically i believe that we re in a student loan bubble americans hold 18 trillion dollars in student loan debt with 92 of that being federal there are only 9 federal student loan servicers and they ve all dropped the ball when it comes to loan repayments for example my servicer nelnet $nni has had their website crash over 10 times since september their official hold time is 90 minutes to talk to a customer service rep but i waited 25 hrs hundreds of thousands of students have been incorrectly billed my loan was bought and sold three times during the pandemic american credit card debt is at an all time high and many students have no ability intention or budget to repay their student loans i believe i read a report that said 5060 of students don t intend to repay their loans they haven t had to for 3 years and many students were pissed off when loan forgiveness was cancelled nelnet has a debt to equity ratio of 41 pe 17 and their profits and cash flows are down if you go on twitter x there are tons of students who are pissed off another thing that makes me upset is that nelnet laid off hundreds of employees and used the money to buy back their own stock the issue is the exec board owns 50 of the stock and has 70 of voting power institutional investors own 30 and it s a low volume stock nelnet aggressively acquired the loan portfolios of other companies and imo they will have to pay the piper when they realize that students are not paying back their loans they are also under investigation from the department of education for violating their contract it blows my mind that the major media outlets are not reporting on how many students are not paying back their loans and investors seem unbothered by nelnets horrible financial stats is there anything i can do to increase publicity and make someone look into this and write a news story on it full disclosure bought put options when their stock was at $100 and i m currently up 120 their stock was worth $60 before covid now at $86 i certainly don t think they are worth 40 more now but given how low their volume has been i don t think investors are aware of how much trouble they re in any recommendations would be helpful i ve seen a few analysts set a price target at $91 but they didn t acknowledge any of the it issues or student sentiment i truly believe if investors knew what percent of students were paying back their loans they would pull out tysm vladimir

boil has a lot of potential natural gas prices not falling boil the leveraged etf on natural gas is looking very promising recently natural gas prices have not dipped below $2 and when they have have quickly rebounded natural gas prices have close to zero chance of touching past all time lows and will never fall again if you look at current technical setup and future outlook for natural gas the all time lows were because of lockdown there is no reason for prices to touch all time lows now or come close to breaking all time lows even with high natural gas storage reports in the united states there is a deficit soon due to an extremely hot summer natural gas is used by commercial facilities to cool during the summer in addition to heating during the winter injection season where natural gas is added to storage will not be enough even though there are claims of close to 5 year average highs natural gas intelligence and other news outlets are all pushing bullish articles shorts have been eliminated including hedge funds algos have switched position to be all in in natural gas which means very likely good news for boil volume indicates this boil is going to be in a likely massive uptrend for the following months commodities expirations is on 425 watch what happens after today s options expiration 421 and 425 to boil the fed interest rate hike will have zero effect on natural gas prices raise another next month and the month after watch the natural gas prices recently they have stabilized and not breaking down technical supports and especially $197 in past couple weeks so don t think about breaking all time lows anytime soon in the future the odds are statistically against

question for apes saying bbby will do what gme did i m not in either for the record what s your thesis here i keep seeing shit like this saying something along the lines of don t panic look what gme did i m not an expert on either but aren t the bull cases wildly different i m not in gme because i don t believe in the thesis but those that are isn t it because of the new management and direction that the company is going in given that how does it make sense to say don t panic about bbby because gme did whatever or are we just going to compare any stock with short interest to gme moving forward gme was historic because most heavily shorted stocks don t do that that s why it got all of that buzz honestly y all confuse me
tsla call buying program always goes into overdrive right before musky dumps the stans will jump on enrons shmeckle but the coincidences in the option market right before musky dumps on his exit liquidity shareholders are undeniable for example last week on wed sept 14th 250 000 30030510 calls expiring friday sept 16th were traded this has continued day after day and only kicked into further overdrive it s unprecedented this day after day action especially in the face of such market risk the call buying only goes into extra regardation in times like late april early august and now the former being when musk dumped shares it is of course coincidence that the call buying program volume of weekly options dies out right after elon is done selling all the while musk is set to be deposed next week for the final slug off in the twitter trial and if musko loses he needs the stock price as high as possible not to mention he has been shamelessly pumping on twitter about absolutely ridiculous shit like expanding a car factory to the river and making it open to the public with little electric tesla boats with a retrofuturistic victoria design lmao don t even get me started on ai day i for one can t wait to see the absolute gold mine the comments will be if i don t get downvoted to oblivion especially from that super special tesla genereal guy

discussion are expositions or conventions shows dying first post on this subreddit so my angle towards this topic is does companies still need to invest in going to conventions lately within the past 23 years since the pandemic 2 of the most prolific expositions e3 electronic entertainment expo and now sdcc san diego comic con are having an exodus of companies deciding to put up their own convention best case for example is disney or move their merchandise online recently sony microsoft and nintendo have decided to skip e3 and place all their product releases via video streaming will this trend of an exodus go further to lets saynaias north american international auto show and also ces consumer electronics show are companies willing to spend more money to put up booths in any of these conventions and possibly even handing product releases without little to no profit at all are conventions still one of the best practices in attracting talent for a company like the slow death of retailbricknmortar store outlets in america we could soon see these shows go out within the next few years how long it depends come share your thoughts and discuss

92822 spy es futures apple and tesla daily market analysis do you guys remember back in june and july when inflation was really bad aka not peaked the fed was telling us the whole time we are going to continue to raise interest rates and inflation isn t coming down and what exactly did the market do it found the one tiny piece of information that it could that was bullish and they went on a 2 month long rally only to it see it come crashing down in epic form this leaves us exactly where we are today so the question remains and will remain probably until this week closes was today a needed relief rally after the markets saw 6 red days for the first time since the 2020 coivd crash granted a day late by my expectations or did we just witness the bottom cemented in and the markets are about to go on another fake pivot rally for me on one hand honestly after tapping 360 yesterday and putting the first 6 red days in since 2020 bottom here makes a whole lot of sense on the other hand there was a lot of oddities about todays rally so lets cover those first lets talk about trin in general i don t ever use trin to make a trade because to me that s not the way to use it in general as you can see a trin of 1 is normal i have never seen a trin of 748 before that is one hell of a balance for spy x200b now why might the trin be lagging well lets take a look at pre market and the opening hour x200b now i have been mentioning this for over a week now but this drop we are experiencing right now is primarily in my opinion drove by nontech sectors we have witnessed tech for the most part holding strong despite spy selling off heavily what we witnessed today was the exact opposite today we saw at open tech was the sole red in the market apple at one point hit 45 and tesla too was very weak however despite that the nyse and the rest of the market was hella green i have been wondering if we were witnessing a rotation within the markets i am beginning to wonder if today what we saw was those shorting the nyse finally took profits i have been saying that until we see tech breakdown and show true weakness that doesn t break intraday we wont get the next big leg down on spy now the issue is we just saw that with tech this morning when the 1 weighted company in spy is down nearly 45 and spy is up 1 there is something seriously wrong with that picture so the question again remains did we see tech finally break down today but it was masted by the boe rate rally or is this about to be a market wide rally x200b there is a lot to unpack here on spy so lets talk about it for the last 4 days we have seen 3706 resistance hold up incredibly well we had not seen any 15min candles break through or close over that resistance in 4 days that was until power hour today now i have been saying as long as we hold 3706 resistance i am bearish today is even more of a wildcard because we breached that resistance however we failed to close over that resistance with a pretty violent eod sell off on one hand we easily can say that this was a breakthrough resistance and now we should see a continuation up to 380390 much like the june low where once we broke through this key 3706 level we never lost it again and from there the bottom was in however unlike the june rally we have spent 4 total days closed below 3706 and unlike june this was not a big dump then v bottom rally in addition when tomorrows candles open that daily 8ema is going to put todays candle top wick as a rejection of a potential breakout of the 8ema generally a rejection of the daily 8ema means there is more downside to be expected look at august 25th highlighted on the daily chart is 3 possible scenarios with similar candle structure whether this is a true v bottom and its only upside form here now or whether this was merely a much needed dead cat bounce is yet to be seen but as of now we are back to playing level to level till we have a direction key support 368 3644 vbottom support 3622 3597 key resistance 3702 blue falling wedge resistance 37425 37344 gap fill 3755 bear channel resistance x200b futures also has a potential v bottom setting up thought it is not as well defined due to the fact that overnight futures dropped nearly 15 before rallying through the morning on the boe news this in a way tells me that the overall sentiment is bearish without that boe news futures were poised to open 1 red which with apple down 4 and tesla down 25 at one point would have led to the 3503500s almost guarenteed futures continues to also reject the daily 8ema breakout but did take out its falling blue wedge key support 3710 3670 3635 3600 blue support key resistance 3770 3805 3835 black bear channel resistnace if we happen to breakout and get through 3835 tomorrow that would give me bias that this is a true v bottom and that we are going to see more upside x200b apple remains intriguing to me on one hand among spy and overall markets it looked very strong and it looked like there was no way it was going to see that 1493 support broken however we saw a pretty gnarly open and dropped all the way down to smack that 1448 support line from there apple calls would have been the golden ticket so the setup we have here on apple is that we remain in the blue falling wedge we put in a new low lowest low since july 14th so apple still remains well over the levels in comparison then spy does however we broke a 8 trading day long support today apple also closed a full candle back below the daily 8ema and has now closed its 5th doji in a row eod it did attempt to take out that 1507 resistnace however failed to do that key support 1476 1448 key resistance 1507 1524 1528 blue falling wedge x200b lets take a look at tesla tesla had an interesting movement overnight and intraday overnight before afterhours closed it was up nearly 25 however by open it was down nearly 25 from there it did see quite the rally through the day there was a ton of struggle at 2838 before the eod spy push green accelerated tesla through it however despite that push green we did not see a close over the daily 8ema and this is actually the 2nd rejection of a daily 8ema breakout in a row interestingly enough this candle close is a bigger bodied dragonfly doji the opposite of the september 26th candle and with this i actually expected to see a rejection and downside from here much like we saw on august 16th and august 25th not shown or reflected on the daily but tesla died out right at key weekly resistance of 2879 we have two potential patterns forming on the daily we have the black falling wedge and we also have a v bottom forming with the red support line the thing with the black falling wedge that unless tesla sees a nice red open under 2838 then that will be broken usually that to me would mean there is more upside to come but with the daily 8ema as resistance i favor downside until tesla closes over the 8ema key support 2838 2814 red support 2702 key resistance 2918 300 x200b then there was the vix today we saw the vix pre market put in the highest high since june 13th however we saw vix from there unwind and never stop the vix definitely paused at 32 and 31 especially for a long time however in the end she unwound and found support at 30 this is where things get unpredictable and anyone telling you they know for sure what is going to happen next is lying with the vix back to 30 but over it and spy back to key 3706 resistance we either saw the vix unwind to prevent full on capitulation with the vix breaching 4050 so that we can continue downward or the vix is confirming with spy that the bottom is in for me going forward i base a lot of stuff off the weekly close on friday night if the futures and spy weekly candle closes over the weekly 200ema and the vix closes below 283 i would think this is a real bottom and not just a dead cat bounce i would be very interested in some 14 and 30dte calls i would see spy retesting 390 and possibly even 400 by end of october however if eow we get a sell off with spy closing below the weekly 200ema regardless of where the vix is then i would have a really hard time being bullish a close over the weekly 200ema then we most likely are looking at a december 2018 weekly 200ema support double bottom a close below the weekly 200ema and we are looking at a covid march 2020 or august 2011 pause before we sell off even more tread lightly here guys 10 challenge today i had to take off just before power hour so sadly i missed the fun but was able to have a pretty good day still you guys who know me know that a true trend day like this with extreme momentum is absolutely my least favorite type of days to trade i treaded very lightly today x200b i want to remind everyone what happened last time spy was 360380 and the vix was over 30 a lot of people blew their accounts up this is not the time to be playing hot and heavy or full porting well really no time is the time for that but this especially is not the time to be doing that if anything when the vix breaks 30 we should be leveraging down the vix being over 30 adds a ton of volatility and unpredictability to the markets i watched a few plays today that i took wanted to take and that i saw others take push reject hard triggering stops only to push well through it i would never recommend removing stops but i would recommend when you enter a play you need to be entering closer to resistance and supports then usual this needs to be a violent entry without hesitation and it needs to be followed with early profit taking don t let a position that s green and the price action is pausing sit take the proftis and gtfo 2 win is a hell of a lot better then a 20 stop loss hit remember live to trade another day x200b x200b daily youtube video be

the situations at svb and frc are materially different here s why silicon valley bank was a bank for startup co s who relied on recurring venture funding rounds to keep the lights on once the the venture capital funding rounds slowed this immediately put pressure on the depositor s cash account as each passing month was another month of cash burn for the startups it banked this led to rapidly declining deposits and in turn provided management with little choice other than to sell their mbs at a loss assets that would otherwise cover interest payments on deposits if maintained on the bs frc banks a different clientele prominently wealthy individuals not startup s who don t have a cash burn and on average maintain less cash in their accounts than the maximum insurance provided by fdic frc is responsibly managed and wrongly intertwined in this conversation there isn t a bank run as the average depositor s funds are 100 insured by the fdic therefore the long term mbs investments are not only sufficient to generate positive nii but are the responsible method to generate low yet consistent interest returns on such a large number of deposits it is very rare to see an opportunity like this in the market and it is why i like the stock once the stock bounces back it will bounce back quickly as short sellers will need to purchase stock in the open market to cover their margin calls this past week was merely a run on the companies stock which lacks fundamental correlation to company performance the decline in value and outstanding short positions has increased the stocks gamma squeeze potential over the past week as its days to cover ratio has increased to over 7 once the stock begins to bounce back it will bounce back fast
stock coup of the century here s how ryan c stock coup of the century the extremes the media is going smear ryan c is just a reflection how desperate the situation is with him and these hedge fundshe must ve done something extremely harmful to them with this bed bath stock move and i try to explore what that is in this video

did rc commit securities fraud or not what do you think official sec filings signed by rc i present the following sec filings and want to see people s opinions on whether this amounts to securities fraud or not 15 august sec filing signed by ryan cohen declaring that he owns almost 78m bbby shares plus option contracts for another 17m bbby shares 16 august sec filing again signed by ryan cohen stating that he have a stake of 945m shares inclusive of his option contracts exercise power 17m bbby shares it specifically states that after reasonable inquiry and to the best of his knowledge and belief each of the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true complete and correct according to the 2 sec filings rc owned his total bbby stake on the 16th august the above filings were submitted through the edgar sec system which makes them publicly available instantly then on the 18th august filing signed again by ryan cohen we have a statement that he has sold all his shares and options on the 16th the same date that he released the previous filing stating that he is still in possession of his bbby stake again this was filed via the edgar system making it publicly available instantly however due to his large stake in the company he could not sell without declaring his intent to do so large shareholders are simply not allowed to sell their stakes without formally declaring it so where is that filing well on the 16th august he filed an f144 form declaring his intent to sell it is worth noting that the f144 is a paper form which means it is filled in by hand and does not become publicly available until months later when it gets digitized unless of course someone specifically requests to see the fillings of the day for a particular company scans it and uploads it online there is no requirement to fill an f144 form to declare someone s intent to sell they can file an edgar form online as they have done with all their other filings to date ryan cohen chose to file via edgar every time except when it was to sell knowing that the document would take a long time to become available online more important than everything else he was filing statements that he owned his bbby stake the same day he filed his intent to sell and the same date he did sell what do you think
ryan cohen is an absolute legend everyone on this sub would have done exactly what he did we are all here to make money he played the game and won you all got sucked in and lost forgot about this short squeeze bullshit you retards

bbby 137m volume and no price movement serious question no conspiracy theories how did bbby have 137m trading volume on friday but the stock barely moved after market open most of that volume came after market open is this just high frequency traders buying any fraction percentage dip and selling any fraction percentage gain
finally my burden to carry x200b story 22 year old uk europoor now europoorer screenshots in gbp got stock on bbby and played the squeeze quite poorly cashing out on 2k profit both times extremely grateful i wasn t in after the $20 to $8 drop otherwise i would be deep in $rope rn after it hit $15 on premarket i thought i would try to get in again encase it squeezed like that again pretty much as soon as i got in on the premarket at $1235 it free fell down to $9 not money i can t live without but it was nice having it don t feel like i am able to do the same as i did with gme with averaging down over years and playing the cycles to come out with a profit feel like i have been taught a good lesson by the market but it hasn t fully bent me over so i think i mma quit now whilst i m ahead if only i thought like this last week lmao
selling everything why don t we just sell everything now and buy back when it crashes another 7090 seems like everyone knows it s going to crash like the com bubble and 08
risk of assignment when trading options if you buy to open a call options position and sell before expiration for profit is there a risk of assignment for you if the buyer excercises the itm calls at expiration or does assignment only apply if you short sell call options can someone explain please

big lots potential on sale below is some quick dd on big lots nysebig the home retailer that i believe maybe overlooked and ripe with potential for a big move relative valuation in order to uncover value in this allknowing market one must be willing to sift through the mud to find cheap companies and big lots is cheap metrics like pb at 061 and pe at 908 point fervently to negative investor sentiment but check out some of their competitors to get a relative idea retailers pb pe as you can see big lots blows away the peers in terms of relative valuation trading for the cheapest earnings and almost half the value of their assets tailwinds coming at this point i don t think anyone questions the nearterm direction of the economy stagflation will lead to tighter consumer budgets forcing people to shop at discount retailers like big lots like everyone else big lots will surely feel pressure from rising interest rates and other effects tied to economic pullback but as store traffic and sales increase this should outweigh the effects they have also been increasing inventories significantly over the past year getting out ahead of supply chain disruptions and rising shipping costs inventories have increased 42 since january of last year which they prudently funded much of through capital efficient saleleasebacks on four of their distribution centers through loading up for oncoming forecasted demand as summer cyclicality swinging in their favor q2 will likely be a move in the right direction impressive dividends not only does big lots offer positive free cash flow at a ridiculously cheap price but they also pay shareholders outsized dividends for holding their stock big lots 573 annual yield bests the competition by a long shot take a look at the below retailers dividend yield for context dividend yield for the sp 500 index was 169 in q2 2022 and has hovered around this level for years big lots marketbeating dividends make this cheap stock even more attractive to hold long term something many of the company insiders are doing through the form of stock grants big lots leadership has been loading up on shares recently over the last six months 465 446 restricted shares have been granted to insiders valued around $16m conversely only 178 498 have been sold granted these newly awarded shares have a vesting period incentivizing insider ownership short squeeze potential given the right catalyst and publicity big lots could present an interesting short squeeze opportunity the wsb veterans will know the ins and outs of a short squeeze but as a refresher some typical indicators that a company could possibly undergo one in the near future are 1 high short volume 5x average daily volume 2 high number of shares short as a percentage of float 10 of float 3 increasing shares short big lots short volume was 99mm shares as of 715 this is 745x average daily trading volume of 13mm shares check big lots shares short as a percentage of float was 374 signaling a significant portion of tradable shares is being shorted check and with 745 days to cover or short interest ratio it would take over a week for short sellers to cover their positions given a sizeable uptick in the share price however it is interesting to note that volume has been trending down in recent months this past month saw a reduction to around 975 000 average daily volume which extends days to cover to 1015 days over two full trading weeks this lengthy amount of time could prove a burdensome liquidation risk for short sellers causing them to close their positions in turn driving big lots price higher the one portion of this threepronged approach that big lots might be missing is the increasing number of shares short as the share price has declined heavily so has the short interest dropping 59 from 630 this is not a great sign for the short squeeze opportunity as it means short sellers are exiting their positions in the green and relieving sell pressure from the stock however share prices have been increasing over the past week faster than the shorts have been exiting which is a good sign for this strategy a large catalyst like q2 earnings outperformance which should be in a couple of weeks could be enough to tip the scale and set off a short squeeze valuation with conservative assumptions in a basic dividend discount model big lots looks undervalued see my ddm valuation assumptions below x200b big lots ddm valuation to come up with a conservative cost of equity i used the capital asset pricing model where the riskfree rate is equal to the current 10year treasury rate beta is a composite average from five separate sources and market rate of return is equal to the 30year inflation adjusted market return this boils down to a capm cost of equity of 107 big lots is expected to pay another $120 annual dividend per share next year and have experienced an impressive fiveyear dividend growth rate of 69 combining these figures results in a target share price of $3159 a 53 premium over 8422 closing price this does not include the effects of a potential short squeeze in my opinion it is not entirely useful to use a discounted cash flow dcf model for big lots because there are so many factors that could impact future cash flows and cost of capital assumptions are rapidly changing due to macro trends i also believe that comparable performance will be a huge key to big lots value creation in the near term and the dcf model does not consider this summary i m not going to ignore the many risks associated with big lots less than desirable financials questionable growth prospects and recent earnings miss and i would normally caution against a relatively small retail chain going up against giants during a time of economic strife but like wsb legend dfv said if none of the companies you invest in go bankrupt you aren t taking enough risk dfv the way i see it the pros outweigh the cons big lots trades extremely cheap they are free cash flow positive they pay an incredible dividend yield they have serious oncoming macro tailwinds and they are one headline away from a massive short squeeze solid fundamentals with huge optionality what s not to love

this isn t a bubble it s a revolution like the industrial revolution just on a grand scale the dot com bubble burst because the internet and the infrastructure were not ready and capable of supporting the companies going public at a rapid pace during the dot com era dial up was the primary internet most homes didn t have a computer or cell phones and robinhood didn t exist today we have fiber optic internet more information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime you can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food get anything you want when you want it if the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place the bust may never have happened a primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 199899 allowing lots of startups to open with cheap moneyborrowing we don t have that now and ai is still thriving most companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom this isn t the same ai has been around for a while for example ibm s watson apple s siri amazon s alexa the gps reading the route instructions to you or microsoft word checking your grammar and spelling on word documents this is ai like it or not we ve gotten so used to them we don t even think of them as ai chatgpt is just another tool in the toolbox and it still has a long way to go before its good most companies will take a while to implement ai as it has to be perfect when it s released and people are trained to work with ai not for ai for example when you order at wendy s and the ai bot can t seem to get your order right people need to be there to step in or when you reach out to your bank to get transaction details and the bot doesn t understand a person needs to be there a lot of the existing companies on the front lines of the ai revolution nvda intel amd etc are seasoned companies with a long history of revenue ai development and integration into the economic system education industrial medical customer service agriculture finance media transportation etc is a great source of growth for all these companies and it s a great opportunity for new companies to emerge and make our lives easier everyone that has a job today can think of atleast one way ai can improve what they do to make work easier this is the ai revolution the artificial intelligence age a new frontier not a bubble

the election could be a big tailwind for stocks heading into the end of the year on an historical basis the sweet spot of the 4year cycle is now stock market historian jeff hirsch from the stock trader s almanac said in a recent note to clients it s a wellstudied phenomenon the sp 500 has tended to underperform in the year leading up to midterm elections and outperformed in the year after midterms especially in the period immediately after the election the average annual return of the sp 500 in the 12 months before a midterm election since 1962 is 03 significantly lower than the historical average of 81 us bancorp said in a recent note that switches after the election in the 12month period after a midterm election the sp is up an average of 163 the outperformance was especially notable in the period three months and six months after the election when the sp was up 73 and 151 on average most attribute the reason for underperformance to policy uncertainty investors do not know which political party will hold a majority in congress which resolves after the midterm election the prospects of the end of the uncertainty are like the light at the end of the tunnel hirsch said in an email to me over the weekend the potential for republican control of the house of representatives and maybe the senate is sending signals that at the very least higher taxes and more spending are unlikely to the extent that 2022 turns out to be a wave election for republicans the bigger the wave the more impactful we think it will be for us equities in the short term and into next year rbc capital said in a note to clients over the weekend hirsch also noted that the postelection rally was broadbased three months after the midterm election the dow sp 500 and nasdaq were all higher on average from 64 to 92 going back to 1950 the sp was higher 889 of the time regardless strong seasonals are not enough to overcome the macro backdrop of aggressive central banks and the prospect of a worldwide economic slowdown we see no compelling reason to add risk despite the possibility of a bit more yearend upside tony dwyer from canaccord genuity said in a note to clients strong seasonals aren t enough to get morgan stanley s mike wilson to change his bearish tone either we remain fundamentally bearish with leading indicators showing further deterioration he said source

besides those mad dog type option trading how to build up your wealth some updates lots of losers said i should fuck off and post it somewhere else well if you don t like it deal with it this post is perfectly good fit in here my largest gain is from meme shares never saying you should not buy those stocks but need to control your risk exposure i believe people are still try to make money here not to throw them away if that is your intention please pm me so i can be part of your money giveaway i am just sharing another way besides gambling with options as long as it makes money why the fuck you care how it s been done suck it up i been watching wsb for a while i did notice that there are quite a few try to beat the market by investing some heavy risky derivatives ie naked callput option if you are a professional trader ignore what i say but if you are just into the market and try to gain some money here is a right way to do it for start you should avoid any shortterm action which by irs any position hold for less than a year not because some bs around simply for tax advantages any assets hold less than a year is subject to ordinary income tax rate which in general much higher than long term capital gain you don t want irs to take a cut of profit for no reason right secondly do not timing the market if there is one thing i learn from the past 5 years of trading nobody knows how market could do tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next week next month or next year this has been proven over and over but people just don t believe it they created graphs lines chats all kind of voodoo try to predict a shortterm market but so far we haven t heard anyone who become super rich by timing or predict it but people still doing it anyway just like those historical numbers on roulette you know mathematically previous results has absolutely nothing to do with current results but we just try to connect the dots and still enjoy it even though it is a bs i do it as well it is human nature but if you want to make money you have against it in 2013 nobel laureate in economic sciences was awarded jointly to eugene f fama lars peter hansen and robert j shiller for proven that short term market movement is not predictible in short it is ramdon movement actually it is geometric brownian motion but we don t need that much details which kind of officially announced everything is bs in financial market however for long time prediction it could be very accurate that is why when you are seeking advise from any kind of finical advisor as long as they are licensed they will recommend you invest at least for 3 years here is a list of long holing stocks i have since 2017 you can see since time elapse the only factor to determine a stock price is it cash flow which is how the price of stock is valuated the price of stock represents company future cash flow discounted to current dollar value so our job is simple when market is in panic mode assets won t price correctly companies with solid fundamentals will trade less than what it worth we buy in and hold until the fair value is presented sell only if you need money for vacation buy a car a house or support child for school or the fundamental of a company has changed in finance people use discount cash flow model to calculate a company future cash flow discounted to current value the calculation is complex and there are lots of parameter input is by human guessing that is why you need to invest in multiple companies to increase you chance of success which leads to my third point unless you have nonpublic information from a reliable source such as our house of speaker nancy pelosi or company s c level executives which then you are subject violation of insider trading you should never put more than 10 of your entire portfolio into one single assets yes people paste lots of attractive screen shots by gambling solely on gme amc bbyc etc but the thing for gambling is that the overall expectation is not in your favor there is always lucky winner for each draw but most likely will not be you since you are not kissed by god investing in multiple assets is your only way to make money in a constant pace which means portfolio diversification but to manage a portfolio is expansive and time consuming it feels like working on a 2nd job you basically acting as a fund manager reading research reports following news trace macro economy and all kind of data even with all that sometimes still got fucked by the market lucky for every demand there is a service we can investing in mutual fund or simply etfs to achieve similar results by paying a small portion of fees which is i recommended most people to do my self for example have 60 of positions on varieties of mutual funds or etfs i know my limitation i am good at value those hightech firm since this is the area that i work for almost 10 years i know the future of the industry better than those analysts so do this part by myself the area that i am not so familiar with such as traditional industries energy and etc i buy funds that will covers it together these assets create a fund of funds which basically covers all good companies across the globe this strategy went well so far average annual return for the past 5 years is around 18 this way has been proven that will work by throwing everything into a monte carlo commonly used in assets return prejection for a long period of time my portfolio return is granteed althought leaglly fund manger can t promiss you anything but for sure long lasting funds will genertate lots of money in a long period of time however no body like to be rich slowly you must give your money time to grow it will pay you back in time
$spy for the next 612 months its cool to use tech analysis to try and gauge the psychology of the markets right now but we cant deny the importance of the macro environment however that hasn t stopped the broad market from showing optimism and this is not just a bear trap the lower low has been denied entry and we are in a reverse head and shoulders pattern on spy ndx cpi looking like falling off a cliff look at used car housing and energy prices they make up a lot of cpi still the fed is going to keep raising rates steadily into q1 23 cuts happen fast though and the market could be looking forward to that too much jpm published doom city saying 25 drawdown in the next 4 months if so looking at that and historically we have spy as the bottom respectively that only happens if the elevator comes like in the 70s and the dot com crash until that happens though spy 440 before i see any good positions for shorts crashes happen fast though who knows on a 612 month outlook but were already down 25 ndx historically crashes can hit 50 drawdown on ndx easy but the snapback is always very quick within 12 months of the bottom cant really time these things i m only looking for a 18 put to hedge the port at the right price maybe if this trendline doesn t get blasted

markets rally was powell dovish fed days usually provide plenty of entertainment for the markets the potential for a monetary policy change or perhaps a slip of the tongue by the fed chair has volatility traders on alert algos are tuned into the slightest change in tone or wording coming from the world s largest central bank the immediate reaction is usually a little confusing most investors sit on their hands and allow the whippy price action to play out the true understanding of how the market comprehends the direction of the fed starts 24 hours after the decision so what did we learn from the fed and which way should we lean in this market sp futures 3minute chart from 2pm4pm x200b as per usual we received the fed statement at 2pm sp futures traded at 4230 up approx 060 nasdaq futures were at 14605 up 1 the fed statement was a carbon copy of the september 20 missive with two notable changes the fed upgraded the language on the economy to state it expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter compared to expanding at a solid pace the other move was to describe the job gains as moderated compared to slowed another nod towards a strong economy that has the fed leaning toward a hike rather than a cut small tweaks but every change in fed language is done so with a purpose hawks took it as a sign that the next likely move remains a hike not a cut this led to some profittaking in equities but the roll was shortlived stocks would muddle around in a tight range as there was little in the way of new information in the statement the markets prepared for fed chair jerome powell s conference call which kicked off at 230pm the sp traded at 4233 up 3 points from 2pm and the nasdaq was 9 points higher as we can see there was little interest in the fed statement this was by design powell used his prepared remarks to hammer home the idea that inflation remained the top priority of the fed while there have been positive developments in pricing data over the past few months there is still a long way to go the rest of his prepared remarks rehashed themes that the fed has focused on the past couple of months the economy is resilient the labor market is strong financial conditions are stable etc nasdaq 100 futures 3minute chart 24pm x200b the question and answer session is always when things get a little more interesting one can see the thrill in the reporters as they fire questions at the fed chair hoping that a slip of the tongue will lead to a move in markets and provide the inquisitor their 15 minutes of fame many a fed chair has caused selling pressure in stocks with one errant answer this is where fed chairpeople earn their money one of the most soughtafter questions is whether the fed decided on what it would do in its next meeting powell continued to walk the line that the central bank remains datadependent he emphasized that the bank has not made any decisions nor did they discuss their plans for december it remains datadependent to wit there will be two jobs reports one this friday and two cpi numbers released before the fed s next meeting the markets will track these closely powell was asked directly if the bias of the fed had changed the reporter felt the fed appeared more neutral than in the one rate hike camp powell did not agree with that assessment and said it was still more likely to hike rather than cut he said the current pause is working well as it allows the fed time to see if it needs to do more on the rate hike front the fed will update its thought process in its december meeting with fresh dot plots and summary of economic projections of course later in the meeting we would walk that back a little as he suggested that the risk of doing too much was now on par with the risk of doing too little this is what led to the breakout in equities around 3pm this flipping back and forth in commentary was reminiscent of his qa at the economic club of new york we would note that expectations for the fed to hold rates at 525550 rose to 82 from 68 following the fed developments cme fed fund futures x200b when asked about the economy powell reiterated that we would need to see slower growth and weakening of the labor market before it could move off its current course he did find it remarkable that we made progress on inflation while the job market continued to strengthen powell stressed that longterm inflation expectations remain anchored and that is key he felt that wages are on the decline in a gradual way that will be supportive of returning inflation to the 2 level this is all in line with prior comments on the subject of the balance sheet and financial conditions the committee is not considering changing the balance sheet and the pace of its quantitative tightening program it looks at a wide range of financial conditions and there is nothing to suggest that there is something broken in the system that would give the fed pause powell was asked what the fed monitors to determine the health of financial conditions he did not want to go into detail but he mentioned the level of the dollar the level of equity prices the level of rates and credit spreads the mention of the level of equity prices is interesting this hardly suggests that the fed put is back but it may provide some relief to the market that the central bank is monitoring the market the fed chair reiterated his belief that the reason for rates marching higher is not because of expectations that the fed will move aggressively higher powell stated that the fed does not look at longterm treasury rates in isolation but it is aware of them they are viewed as part of the broader picture the fed chair was asked about the neutral rate which is something that has been up for debate he did not give a number but stated that the current policy was in restrictive territory naturally the fed continues to monitor the geopolitical situation the sp would close at 4260 30 points higher than where it was at 2pm the nasdaq rallied 123 points over that period obviously powell was hawkish given such a move right not so fast powell reaffirmed a lot of prior comments if we were to give a narrative to the move it is simply that powell did not say anything to disrupt the bounce that has taken place the past three sessions market participants usually take 24 hours to allow things to play out the apple aapl earnings on thursday afternoon and jobs report on friday morning stand as more significant events for the markets the fed is going meeting by meeting and asking itself at each one whether it is making progress on its goals it is that simple we will see what type of progress they are making with the jobs and cpi reports today s fed meeting was a nonevent we suggest moving on and going back to the regularly scheduled program which is a market that has bounced and now testing key downward trend lines and 20day moving averages for resistance this should be the north star traders use moving forward
just sold my house here s the market crash and food shortage yolo dd so i m the guy that wrote the dd about the housing crisis that made it to the front page of reddit before sitewide admins deleted it and gave me a hate speech warning there s a copy up on another forum you can get to in my profile that i can t link to here because the wall street firms running the various finance subreddits like drama i started looking for a new place to live and listed my house shortly after posting that i m also the guy who wrote this dd about the coming food shortage tldr market go down food go up bank account go up more buy large pizza with profits good news kids there s no wannabe riddler nonsense in this post just straight answers and hard numbers plus screenshots of my positions i ve got five figures in already and more than twice that on the way waiting to clear settlement x200b first the market crash i m going to try to keep this shorter simpler and more picture based than normal here s the ta for the market crash i m going to show you the same picture twice in a row x200b i have spy going down to 300ish within the next two months ie by the end of october resistance around 390 385 and 360 plus maybe 340 once we lose the previous low of the year at 363 it should be a skydive run down to the new morgan collar floor which i think is around 300 the century long trendlinemean reversion point is a little under 200 pretty sure that s why burry has the final low at 184 i ve got the final low at 6090 proof i ve been saying this for awhile because i think we dip well below that meantrend before recovering for reference my levels for the first bottom after the peak were 350380 then a run up to 420450 before the real crash started the real crash is the part we re on now i did not think the run down from 430 to 390 would happen as fast as it did so i ve taken a lot of 10 profits that could have gone as high as 800900 over the last few days hey nobody s perfect and green is green take profits people i can proudly say i hit the end of day and overnight bounce from 91 to 92 and flipped back short again almost perfectly which is incredibly rare for anyone except domino from deadpool or prince from bullet train and more luck than skill x200b second the housing crash if you haven t read any of my dd s about housing and why it s in trouble here s one from a year ago on why the not enough houses narrative was bogus well they re all on my profile but given that you probably don t care this post someone else made about what they d done pretty much perfectly sums it up x200b basically wall street is only responsible for about 13rd of the cash buyers of houses you re seeing in the market the rest are geniuses like this guy who used margin asset backed loans and inflated equity values to buy property with cash and accidentally loaded up all kinds of risk that nobody picked up on also see the video of the 4880 units boom guys but i mean basically everyone has gone from calling anyone pointing out the housing bubble chicken little to saying yeah man everyone knew that so there are any number of idiots who can provide you with info on this though i expect it ll take a few more months before the equity linkage comes up in the mainstream press x200b third the food shortage the first farm scout reports came in last week from the midwest and they re pretty bad these aren t definitive numbers wise but they re very good at identifying directionality wheat corn and soybeans all came in about 4 under usda estimates in the midwest breadbasket states remember kids this doesn t cover california which is even more drought and heat stricken and produces 25 of us food effectively this means us production can t offset the massive shortages occurring in europe china south america and india the situation in china is particularly brutal they ve had flooding then went into the worst heat dome effect since the start of recorded meteorology not a joke 1876 is the last time things might have been this bad back into what looks like a record monsoon season and more flooding if you want an idea of how seriously you should take the crop scout report here s a snapshot of futures prices before and after it was released x200b remember it s worse in europe china south america and india and they all have significantly less resources to deal with this than the usa does i m guessing the usda only slightly revises their september yield estimates downwards so we ll still have another downside surprise in american production when the harvest actually begins this fall meanwhile most worldwide grain production estimates i ve been tracking are consistently underestimating the amount of production and distribution lost from the ukraine war and the extreme weather from the third year of la nina while significantly overestimating the ability of countries like the us and canada to make up the difference x200b fourth the energy shortage here s a fun one this is the first dd i ever wrote for wsb made myself and others a very nice chunk of change on it it s from around 18 months ago you ll notice that everything i pointed out in there about lack of capex in the energy sector and incompetent belligerent relations between east and west and how that would impact energy prices has played out basically exactly as i predicted except even more to the downside because the guys who failed out of clown college are now running the circus i don t actually have any positions on the mess that is the global energy supply system right now outside of a small one in uranium shares only based on the theoretical hope that sanity at some point prevails power use is going to drop as the summer heatwaves subside into autumn s cooler weather everything with energy is just too priced in right now except the possibility that this winter will be warmer than average i think we do get opec output cuts this fall that will probably match up with the end of the us spr withdrawals remember that s got to be built back up eventually and i ll be looking to get in on energy around october or november but for right now i m not touching it ymmv the price cap idea we re seeing from g7 leaders is just a bad sketch comedy segment you can have price caps or you can have supply you only get one not both i mean you see copium and hopium on these subs all the time maybe my china investments will be profitable and other such nonsense but the stuff the big boys pull is flat out ridic and to think putin got all of this with a small $1 millionyear bribe to gerhard schroeder x200b fifth the next crisis political unrest and mass migration i said in this dd a couple of months ago about how we d see an increase in protests riots and political unrest as a result of increasing energy and food prices and those would be blamed on racial or social issues rather than the true causes of said unrest inflation wealth concentration and shortages the recent mass protests in the czech republic in paris and whatever the hell the president s red speech of doom last week was are all examples of this speaking of instability it s worth mentioning that roughly 13 of pakistan is currently underwater but its fine that s a very stable country with good relations with its neighbors no corruption no relationships with terrorist organizations and no nuclear weapons look remember the last time we had a big spike in food prices and some tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire starting the arab spring and how like half of syria and the middle east walked to europe and that just kinda fucked everything up like every mass migration of people throughout the entirety of human history has civilization runs on food energy and stability take the first two away and the third goes right out the window things are going to get bad in the first world and flat out apocalyptic in the third the only thing keeping sri lankans on sri lanka right now is the ocean lots of places that don t have that barrier are going to see folks walking off x200b sixth my positions x200b i ll be adding a lot more once the rest of the money i have en route to my brokerages settles i also have a small shares only position in uranium some bbby i was buying shares and calls back at $430 and i sold some on the way up and no i don t think the stock with the 102 official short interest is done with volatility and a rather silly amount of drs d gme including some $320share bags that have made me incredibly strong over the last year finally because i always always always get asked about this how do i find this stuff or research plays or figure out what to invest in x200b that s it that s how you do it you fucking look and do the research good luck out there people here it is the sum of the last two years of my research and plays i ll keep providing updates on how this goes profits or losses

amc not a gme dd copy paste disclaimer i am long on gme the title is a joke you don t need to downvote due to title amc february last year in the black boxed out area x200b why did $amc stop and consolidate at $550$600 in february of last year fundamentals 1 $5billion in debt due 2026 2 straight to streaming movie releases 3 covid19 4 broker pco andor buying limits 5 dilution 6 institutional selling wanda sentiment 1 retail investors liked the price of the stock 2 biggest movie theater chain x200b the company was not in great shape overall yet the new found retail investors managed to stop the drop at approx $550 short sellers had ridiculous price targets even at 1 penny which shows that a $550 drop was not low enough after a bit of hanging around this level it popped up over $10 x200b it did its rip an attempt to shake some retail out and it consolidated up high the short sellers began to lose strength instead of now consolidating at $5$6 it was consolidating over $10 well if they cant get you to sell while its down or when its trading sideways only one way for it to go and it is up x200b now what we are looking at is something similar to february they spiked the price down and yet amc held its ground at around $10 instead of $5 they drove the price up a bit just like they did back then to try and shake some retail off it worked as it now consolidated lower instead of higher like it consolidated last year now it seems to be trending upwards and some of those retail investors who jumped ship may now be loading the boat again x200b plenty of green now strength is being shown in the price as of recent and it has been consistent x200b so now that is a break down on how the price has moved for the last year or so lets talk about what has changed this time around this is the most vaguest of honestly in my opinion meaningless ta on amc that is just solely talking about price to me it seems we are headed slowly into a spike as shorts are starting to worry at $16 short sellers are down 60 if short at $10 any short seller who is green may also be worried about diminishing profits x200b ftds as of recent we had a massive spike of ftds for amc june 28th approx $130m worth of shares 2 of float had ftds think about that for a second 2 of a float missing to put that in perspective you only need 05 of the float ftd for about two weeks to go on threshold securities list normally only happens to penny stock this is 4x that the highest ftd amount was approx 11m in may between the januaryjune run up ortex data two week lapse a steady increase in short interest shown above two week old so not up to date exchanged report si of ff is lower then june but much higher then the second consolidation levels in about april it is also steadily rising along with the price which imo is juicy the lowest point prior to the june run up was about 176 of ff si we havent seen those number much since the drop in price in the june run up it has been steadily rising x200b higher reported si 37 of ff then the april consolidation highest short interest ever unlike of ff this is amount of shares sold short with no relation of float and it is not based it is an important number to look at simply a huge amount of shares sold short number of loans per day highest ever x200b cost to borrow spiking to prejune levels x200b dtcsir highest since 2020 short interest ratio days to cover simply a mathematical equation that varies but for ortex they do shares on loan andor estimated short interest and divide it by 2 week andor 3 month volume average doing this you get 4 different number and all 4 are higher then prior to the june run up of last year sirdtc is a number that is often used to verify if short sellers are having a hard time maintaining a short position on a stock it is one of many short squeeze indicators utilization 100 x200b yeah that is some time with 100 utilization what is important to note is that the shares on loan did change but they almost immediately borrow up every share made available utilization is a of amount of shares that are being made available to borrow and how much of that is borrowed if only 100k shares are borrowable and 100k are borrowed then we can have 100 utilization but that doesnt mean much if the float is 500m right so the amount of shares being borrowed in correlation to that 100 is important so yes they borrowed it all up but how much shares were borrowed obviously they are in panic to borrow it all up right away but what was actually borrowed a fuck ton just like in june the number spiked and began to take a dip as the price started to move up is that an indication of some lenders asking for shares back in my unprofessional opinion yes more so evidence is that the shares are being returned and not made available again utilization remains 100 so what the f is the difference this time around if you are scared to buy into amc then you are being a little bitch you need to realize the company fundamentals and ta is much stronger now then before lets take a look at amc last february fundamentals 1 $5billion in debt due 2026 restructured and now due 2029 2 straight to streaming movie releases exclusive theatrical releases now 3 covid19 nope 4 broker pco andor buying limits atleast not right now 5 dilution with what 6 institutional selling wanda majority held by retail who bought between $10 and $70 sentiment 1 retail investors liked the price of the stock 2 biggest movie theater chain x200b the top 3 most important to take notice of is 1 the debt is not due until 2029 so that blows a hole in many short thesis that existed last year when they managed to bring it to $5 i simply don t see it coming down to those levels 2 no pco andor buying limits this is important imagine having a stock with limited or no buying allowed and the lowest it was brought is fuckin $5 so who is the risk of buying it at $10$15 you are allowed to buy now so how can they bring it down to those levels again if buying is currently being allowed 3 covid19 limited seating fears of catching the virus deltaomnicron all of that was happening last year and obviously put a bit of fear in the movie going experience a lot of that is gone now people are now flocking theaters look at minionsspiderman no way home these were the top three shortseller talking points for amc last year i don t see any of these fundamentals growing for shortsellers if anything all three are either weakening or don t exist anymore the price of the stock currently in my eyes is super suppressed and the short sellers are not shorting because they believe its worth $5 they are shorting because they have no other choice these clowns are fuckin trapped
the market is random my ass the notsorandom walk theory the fed has destroyed the free market it s illegal for anyone to manipulate the stock market with violators facing potential lifetime imprisonment however these rules don t seem to apply to the fed which is disgraceful the fed manipulates the stock market as if it were a puppeteer pulling strings without the fed s interference we might actually have a fair and free market it s amusing to think about retail traders on robinhood believing they re the ones driving the market upward setting new highs but the truth is moving the market takes trillions of dollars just look at the sp500 do we need a ruler to see how straight the line is consider robinhood s user baseabout 10 million users with an average account size of $5 000 yes retail traders can influence the market but they re just a small part of the bigger picture i firmly believe the fed is the behemoth beneath the surface sitting in the driver s seat and injecting trillions of dollars into the stock market how is this even legal and fair
realistic bbby price prediction bbby is priced at 20 the time of writing which equals to 16 billion dollars in market cap it can sound like a lot but there is still a substancial amount of room to grow i believe today s short squeeze was just a small taste of what it can do this coming days in comparison to gme and amc they currently have a market of 128 billion they are all in very different consumer sectors but they can be put under the same umbrella of meme stocks i still do believe that there is a huge amount of shorts still hanging and with some other big institutions are interested in reversing what happened to gme and want to heavily profit by buying up in the coming days and selling once they believe the peak has been touched my prediction is that it will go to 80 95 dollars per share by this week bringing it s market cap between 64 billion and 76 billion my current positions are 5p 819 just kidding i have 20c and 45c expiring friday
mark cuban calls stock buybacks everything wrong with what companies do in response to the proposed tax on stock buybacks the entrepreneur mark cuban just took a stand in a debate that s hotly controversial in business circles and congress no subject is more controversial in economic circles right now than taxes tensions heighten even more when the specific subject is a new tax aimed at businesses simply put the business community hates taxes no surprise then that last week when the us senate agreed to a 1 tax on share buybacks as a way to partly finance president joe biden s climate and healthcare bill the proposed measure prompted a lot of debate opinion on the benefits and disadvantages of buybacks is sharply split the house is expected to vote on the bill this week enter mark cuban one of the most listenedto and admired entrepreneurs the shark tank star has never made a secret of his aversion to share buybacks he says buybacks are not good for most employees of the companies that do them cuban reiterated his dislike of share buybacks in a lengthy exchange consisting of multiple tweets on twitter with norbert j michel vice president and director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives at the libertarian think tank cato institute buybacks reward holders who want to sell a littleappreciated fact is that most repurchased shares either go to employees who later sell to investors or are acquired to reduce equity dilution after employees have sold stock michel tweeted on aug 10 michel commented on a wall street journal column titled the virtues of stock buybacks why not just buy back shares from those employees and eliminate their pricing risk when they sell cuban commented they could do both compensate with shares and buy shares from them later michel responded but they rarely buy those shares directly from employees cuban argued and employees can t time their sales to the announcement so the emps who can least afford the risk and may be the least financially literate own all pricing risk when they are able to or need to sell read the full article mark cuban calls stock buybacks everything wrong with what companies do this was in response to the proposed tax on stock buybacks do you agree

well then jpmorgan chase it is to kick off the worldwide recession festivities turns out jamie dimon is the most retarded degen gambler of all anyone know his username bc the loss porn is going to be unbelievable archive link federal data show jpmorgan chase is by far the riskiest bank in the us bypam martens and russ martens july 26 2022 the longtenured chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase jamie dimon likes to use the phrase fortress balance sheet when talking about his bank to congress or shareholders but the data stored at its federal regulators show that the bank is by far the most systemically dangerous bank in the united states and despite its high risk profile neither congress nor federal regulators have restricted its growth its assets have soared by 65 percent since the end of 2016 and stood at $395 trillion as of march 31 making it the largest bank in the united states making this situation even more dangerous the bank hasadmitted to five criminal felony counts over the past eight years and a multitude of civil crimes and multibillion dollar fines all during the tenure of dimon neither congress nor federal regulators nor the justice department that brought those felony counts has demanded that dimon be replaced the board of directors of the bank has been equally obsequious toward dimon awarding hima $50 million bonus after the bank admitted to its fourth and fifth felony counts for tens of thousands of trades that rigged the precious metals and us treasury markets our data comes from the national information center a repository of bank data collected by the federal reserve it is part of the federal financial institutions examination councilffiec which was created by federal legislation to create uniformity in the examination of us financial institutions by the various banking regulators each year the national information center creates a graphic profile of banks measured by 12 systemic risk indicators thedata used to create these graphicscome from the systemic risk report or form fr y15 that banks are required to file with the federal reserve to measure the systemic risk that a particular bank poses to the stability of the us financial system the data is broken down into five categories of system risk size interconnectedness substitutability complexity and crossjurisdictional activity those measurements consist of 12 pieces of financial information that banks have to provide on their y15 forms the most recent data is for the period ending december 31 2020 it indicates that in 8 out of 12 measurements or twothirds of all systemic risk measurements jpmorgan chase ranks at the top for having the riskiest footprint among its peer banks one of the 12 financial metrics is based on the intrafinancial system liabilities of each bank this shows how much money a particular bank has at risk at other banks by using inputs such as how much of its funds it has on deposit with or has been lent to other financial institutions the unused portion of any credit lines it has committed to other financial institutions and its holdings of debt equity commercial paper etc of other financial institutions the idea is to understand the interconnectivity of systemicallyrisky megabanks and whether one distressed megabank could cause a daisychain of contagion with other megabanks such as the contagion caused by citigroup and lehman brothers in 2008 jpmorgan chase s footprint for intrafinancial system liabilities is huge the 2020 data show that jpmorgan chase has $577 billion exposure in that category that s an increase of $182 billion over what it showed in that category in 2019 a startling increase of 46 percent in one year equally unnerving jpmorgan chase ranks number one in the instruments that played a major role in blowing up wall street in 2008 otc overthecounter derivatives these are private contracts between two parties and lack the transparency or protections of being traded on an exchange this means if the counterparty defaults and the exposure is large enough it could put a federallyinsured bank at risk this is not a hypothetical scenario the giant insurer aig blew itself up in 2008 because it was holding tens of billions of dollars in otc derivative contracts for the biggest banks on wall street on which it could not pay its obligations the us government was forced to nationalize aig and paid more than $90 billion to the banks for their aig derivative contracts and securities lending obligations according to the data jpmorgan chase has the largest exposure to otc derivatives with $4438 trillion exposure the doddfrank financial reform legislation of 2010 was hyped as ending the hubris of otc derivatives it was supposed to force these vehicles into the sunlight of exchanges and central clearinghouses but that hasn t happened corporate business media is simply declining to report on it according to the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal regulator of national banks as of march 31 2022 only 434 percent of banks derivative holdings were centrally cleared see page 13 at this link that statistic comes 12 years after doddfrank was signed into law showing just how lax federal regulators have been in enforcing the congressional intent of the law adding to the systemic dangers of jpmorgan it is a pivotal cog in the us payments system the bank was responsible for $510 trillion of the us payments system in 2020 a 51 percent increase over its size in that category in 2019 the $510 trillion is more than the next three largest banks in that category combined bank of new york mellon at $19423 trillion citigroup at $17657 trillion and bank of america at $13834 trillion and despite dimon perpetually bragging about the bank s fortress balance sheet the federal reserve has yet to explain why a unit of jpmorgan chase jp morgan securities needed to secretly borrow a cumulative $259 trillion in repo loans from the fed in the last quarter of 2019 long before the first case of covid19 appeared in the us see chart below the senate banking committee has told wall street on paradethat it will be scheduling its annual hearing with wall street ceos before the year is out the committee needs to stop using wells fargo as a convenient punching bag and focus on the dangerous elephant in the room jpmorgan chase by the way wells fargo did not rank number one in even one of the 12 systemic risk categories x200b

1423 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis and fomc minute review today was fomc minutes lets take a look at what was reiterated remember none of this is new information all of this is things said at the december fomc meeting information below form zerohedge fed officials were not pleased by the surge in stocks easing in financial conditions ahead of the meeting warning against an unwarranted easing in financial conditions participants noted that because monetary policy worked importantly through financial markets an unwarranted easing in financial conditions especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the committee s reaction function would complicate the committee s effort to restore price stability slowing rate hikes is not pivoting participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committee s 2 percent objective a number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the committee s resolve to achieve its pricestability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path few signs of a wageprice spiral participants noted that in the latest inflation data the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelterwhich represents the largest component of core pce price inflationwas high they also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight consequently while there were few signs of adverse wageprice dynamics at present they assessed that bringing down this component of inflation to mandateconsistent levels would require some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance fomc inflation forecasts core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down while core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased risks are skewed to the upside for inflation but downside for growth with inflation still elevated the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside moreover the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected over the next year a subdued global economic outlook and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activity and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline qt staff indicated that they would continue to monitor money market conditions closely as balance sheet reduction proceeds x200b bloomberg economics anna wong summarized as follows minutes reveal that fed staff are cautious about interpreting recent data as showing a definitive decline in inflation for example they note that the falling inflation compensation implied by tips is due to a decline in risk premiums rather than inflation expectations staff point to jobopenings data moving down in october however jolts data for november released today showed an upward revision to october s job openings and the vacancytounemployed ratio actually edged back up in november staff sound more alarmed about nominal wage growth than in previous fomc minutes hinting that the underlying pace might be running at 5 so fed still is scared inflation hasn t peaked and they are worried about the strength of the economy x200b when we take a look at the daily here you can see we are still in this blue consolidation channel and are still also in a red breakoutdown triangle today we closed back over 383 for only the second time since december 21st however we did reject at the daily 20ema yet again the daily 20ema has historically been an area of key rejection and until we can truly break through that which also would be a break through of this blue consolidation channel its hard to feel bullish realistically we remain stuck in this 3766 to 3863 channel until further notice with the structure of this triangle and blue channel we actually could find ourselves trading here until cpi on january 12th next thursday key support 3831 3808 3796 3781 key resistance 3843 3864 388 x200b tomorrow brings yet again some more economic data and much like this mornings i do not think it will be received very well x200b futures has such a nice consolidation channel going with such perfectly held levels its hard not to admire it today we came down and confirmed 3842 as support however in the same motion we also rejected at 3875 with that daily 20ema rejection and a long wick off that rejection we should favor a slight bearish movement going forward however we continue to hold support extremely well much like spy until we see this blue consolidation channel hard break we are just stuck in this range key support 3875 3842 3805 key resistance 3895 3910 3920 x200b the tesla trend of huge red day green open continues to pay out swung a nice call this morning for a modest profit x200b we are now at day two of our sell off and still have about 89 more to go minimally x200b taking a look at the daily chart here you can see that we ended up established 109 as a very nice support area and actually formed a pretty nice double double bottom here this pattern actually should provide a bigger upside push this inside day that we had today though should provide a continuation pattern downward though despite the bullish appearing double double bottom holding 109 support we are coming in very close to that red falling wedge resistance line though 1124 remains resistance to hold the red falling wedge integrity 1005 is the support of that darker red support line which is the 202223 bear channel the tesla has been trading in if we were to lose that support that would really open a bigger down side and be quite the blow to the technical x200b as i was expecting we ended up getting that morning doji star pattern playing out today on the vix i was suspecting to see some upward movement on the vix today and with the fomc minutes out and really nothing too major to move the vix until next weeks cpi we should see the vix start to unwind slightly into the end of this week however as we go into cpi week next week we actually could see in the 23 days leading into cpi the vix start a move up again however with the support dating back to december 22nd breaking today and closing under 20ema but at the 8ema this should be a bullish favortism for the markets the rest of the week however if market digests the next two mornings of heavy data badly or bearishly we could see spy drop despite this set up daily log x200b took a small red day today tough day to trade with the extreme choppy morning followed by an impressive sell off that immediately led into a pump before minutes historically we have seen a nice pump on minutes despite them being bearish however they were not received very well today for me playing a high probability play and losing doesn t bother me much it s the same with a high probability set up based on my trading rules technical not every trade will be green and not ever trade is going to be that big winner but in trading we take the highest probability trades sometimes we win sometimes we lose today we lost tomorrow we will look to make that loss up small gain by small gain

you think there hasn t been any inflation in the past from 20002020 there has been we had massive asset inflation in those two decades now we have consumer price inflation as well the us could never afford iraq and afghanistan and people are paying the price now if you lever up you lever down as well if you inflate assets eventually they will come down too basically you can view the inflated assets we had over the past 22 years as inflationary potential it s somehow like a big ponzi scheme that needs some time till it plays out who s going to pay for that that s right the ordinary consumer you how you might ask with inflation the government can t deflate because that would mean default and they don t like to lose their monopoly on violence so they naturally choose to inflate inflation can be viewed as an additional tax a tax on everything who s paying for the government debt well you do the rich will try to hide their assets like they always do they will probably go into gold and silver as well maybe even bt c save yourself before they devalue the dollar even more when the printer goes back brrrr buy some real money go buy some gold and or silver maybe some commodities and agriculture as well heck even real estate will do but wait a little you won t regret it

market profile analysis on tsla going into friday s session i wanted to share some of my observations on tsla from a tpo chart just some context on what a tpo chart exactly is tpo stands for time price opportunity each tpo denoted by a single letter represents a point of time where the security trades at a specific price a single tpo is printed on the chart every time that a certain price in my example for tsla each block is 10 cents is touched during any time period typically the periods are set to 30 minutes therefore every different letter that you see in the distribution denotes a different 30 minute period basically we re analyzing the amount of trading activity based on time i also utilize a similar chart but for volume instead of time now to the analysis there s a few important takeaways for me from thursday s session we created a poor high this is indicated by multiple letters at the high and a lack of a clear tail like we see for the 1011 session highs a poor high on a tpo chart indicates an abrupt halt in upward price movement often lacking excess it suggests an incomplete auction the poor high has two forward looking indications the first is that prices should back away from the poor high as there are a number of longs trapped at poor location the second is that if the next day or in some subsequent session the poor high is revisited then the odds are strong that it will break and move higher this is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor high that lacked symmetry without a proper top we can also see that there was not much interest in trading around 26040 26090 range and a new distribution was setup lower at the close based on afternoon trading i prefer bears going into friday s session bears will look to defend 26090 and prevent the stock from trading into the original distribution target would be 255 as that is an area where we have spent a lot of time in last friday and monday s session the strategy is simply to play with the single prints as that is indicative of a lack of interest in that area and take profit near the highest point in the distribution as we expect to spend a large amount of time trading in that area tpo chart for 1010 to 1012 rth sessions

51722 spy daily ta quite an interesting day today yet again less reverals today but still full of surprises x200b as you can see we had four full reversals today of course one of those was the markets reaction to jpow being interviewed by wall street journal at 2pm i look back at my ta on friday and this is the type of day i thought we would have yesterday was just a dollar short and a day early it looks like x200b but today we opened near 15 and immediately saw spy drop us from 40663 to 40258 around the first hour of the day from there we slow trended back to the hod before jpow spoke the markets did not like what jpow had to say at all however the market still made a new hod after he stopped speaking after hours we are actually seeing spy reject its 15min bear channel resistance which is at 409 if this rejection holds and futures sees a sell off 4100 is similar support we could see the bigger rejection and red day tomorrow going into tomorrow we actually have a strong bear and strong bull case x200b bull case today we saw our fourth green candle mind you two of the days were negative but due to price action they are green on the daily the other two candles have been green candles that have finished 2 the vix has been downtrending since may 12th and having gone from 35 to 2611 at close it is more likely to continue the dump to 20 then revisit 30 with the momentum overall jpow spoke today but until minutes are released next wednesday the 25th there really isn t much we can expect catalyst wise there was a strong support bounce at 385 and bulls haven t let up since that we had that bounce bulls should see a continuation day tomorrow bulls also managed to close above the daily 8ema with a full candle for the first time since april 20th bear case spy has not seen back to back green days since may 4th while we did close above the daily 8ema we closed with a hammer candle and its arguable that bears lost all steam end of day when they had 410 channel resistance in their grasps after hours is seeing a rejection of the 15min bear channel resistance the last two times the vix was at this level which was also after the feds spoke the next day it shot back up and spy saw very red days both times jpow today in his interview did say some new things that the markets arguably have not heard him say and do not have priced in yet in addition in the past whatever the market does intraday when jpow speaks it usually does the opposite the next day the death cross on the daily chart 100ema under 200ema just occurred bulls have arguably had two easy days where they could have broken out to 410 and both days saw sell offs immediately at open x200b as i mentioned the vix had a similar trend back on may 4th which was fomc and saw a massively green day actually the days are oddly similar morning dump pump to jpow speaks dump when he speaks then rocket to new hod once hes done that day was followed up with a massive 355 red day 10 challenge overall i felt more confident in my entries today biggest loss came from some over night puts i held and then also a double bottom i missed at 1045 when i thought it was going to be a rest instead of a double bottom reversal while it was still a red day for me it was a better day overall tomorrow i will not be trading as i have a field trip with the kiddo and i will be looking forward to a nice break from spy x200b

life in 2029 rates at 35 inflation at 69 it was may 4th 2022 you remember it so well jpow had his little meeting where he whisperes some words like economy is strong we need to raise rates though i understand the average economic person is being fucked in the ass every night by spending half their income on rent with the rest going to an $11 jar of tomato sauce actually i have no fucking clue cause i m rich af but for these meetings i have to pretend like i know so that the spy can go uppy you thought that if you cannot even afford to drive to work then the economy is headed for recession you spent $150 on puts that fomc day only to have them expire worthless damn that was two days worth of gas money fast forward to 2029 the spy has increased to 5 million pesos every fomc meeting jpow says it s important we start qt but i don t think it is the right time we ll start qt june 1st every year jpow has said he will qt june 1st but he never does you get out of bed sorry i mean you get up underneath the park bench and head to work you made it to director of trading at goldman sachs you make a good salary making 1 000 wendy s burgers a year is pretty good in comparison to the general population the only thing is that a house costs 2 million wendy s burgers the other thing is that blackrock owns every house in america and they use those houses to store their pesos and burgers an average economic human is not worthy of living in a house so they keep them empty it s too much of a hassle to have a lowlife occupy the house better to have the inflation appreciate the asset as well as monetary storage it all sounds bad but hey it could be worse you think at least the fed did a great job at not letting things get out of control you think damn i cannot imagine what would happen if they tipped the economy into recession in 2022 thank god for this soft landing

daddy pow pow just fucked us all and here is why summary the 5bp rate hike though high for what we have seen in recent years isn t enough to effect that change that daddy pow pow wants to occur daddy pow pows plan daddy pow pow hopes that by giving a 5bp increase that it will slow down consumer demand by slightly increasing prices of consumer goods for many who have surplus income this will have little to no impact on how they live for others this may cause them to decrease the quality of product that they buy or simply to buy less for most this will negatively impact household savings in doing this daddy pow pow admits that he has no significant ability to impact supply chain issues most of the problems we are seeing with prices of consumer goods relate to supply chain issues so aside from potential decreasing supply chain demand there will be little to no impact on that front supply chain issues will still fuck us in the end daddy pow pow hopes that this increase in prices will get persons who are currently not working to go back to work these persons include retired persons teenagers college students persons collecting unemployment persons living on government stipends welfare etc if nothing else changed over the next 12 months except for what daddy pow pow did then this may likely cause more persons to work and thus increase our economic stability growth however what daddy pow pow didn t account for in this plan are the things that will happen which he knows he can t prevent things to come that daddy pow pow didn t bake into the 5bp hike there are so many things that daddy pow pow didn t consider that i will list some out here when costs go up students can borrow more money for college universities will forecast expected costs of college and students will be able to borrow up to that amount this may actually lead to less college students working part time jobs as it becomes easier for them to get more money and then spend it on booze beans and rice legislators are already finding solutions to keep their indentured voters indentured to vote for their party and these solutions will completely debunk what daddy pow pow is attempting to do for example if we were to see ubi even at a level of $200 month it would completely override any changes daddy pow pow was hoping to create just think of all the ways our government buys their voters by keeping people from being productive citizens any legislation pushing such ideologies will negate the intended effect of what daddy pow pow is trying to achieve supply chain issues may be heightened with decreased demand if i m a vendor who ships dog food and it costs me $100 to ship the dog food regardless of if it s 20 bags or 50 bags then i would ideally want to ship in batches close to 50 bags high demand supports cost savings for the supply chain what happens though when my price per unit to ship goes up because my batch size decreases well someone has to swallow those costs which means i lose some money and i also pass some losses onto my consumers in the form of a higher price now businesses are slowing down and prices go up even more we might suggest that this could be like pseudo inflation we re just barely starting to watch this whole war shit show a 5bp rate hike with possibility of war suggests that daddy pow pow thinks the whole war shindig is a complete joke and that there is no reason to address the inflation in an urgent manner we can address it slowly over 2 4 years with his plan however if we see increase in war then his plan goes flying out the window basically daddy is saying war is a joke and all the virtue signaling retards are exactly that regards what if though we do see more war what if china does indeed invade taiwan weelll shiiiiit we fucked good because at that point our efforts to address inflation wouldn t have been aggressive enough daddy pow pow chose to implement a slow plan that takes several years but daddy pow pow has no clue what the future holds do we idk maybe one of you apes does but i sure as frickles don t that being said i believe it would have been a stronger more effective move to go ahead and push out a 75bp or 10 bp rate hike as that would force more change now which would leave us in a better position the next time shit hits the fan can you smell it the shit blowing form the fan what this means for us this actually means increased uncertainty daddy pow pow took a weak decision which leaves us vulnerable to new events if daddy pow pow had taken a strong fist stance at a higher rate then we would have less uncertainty about future events uncertainty bad apes we all know green today red in some day coming soon basically daddy pow pow just took those swinging arms he talks with and did the whole pow pow get fisted where we all walk away feeling relieved at first but then a few days later when our assholes are still bleeding we start to realize all the damage he did

gold bull case i think that gold has had a great run back up towards alltime highs but it has a lot of room to run to get there i think right now the stock is a great buy on fundamentals and is above 50 and 200 day sma in terms of other support for the bull case gold as a precious metal has been performing well as expected in this type of market and barrick naturally will be tied to that performance photos additionally utilizing fibonacci levels shows that if it breaks past this resistance there is more room to run until 22 without resistance image 1 also utilizing a support and resistance calculator within python it can be seen that the stock is above average resistance and toeing the line to pass the last current level of resistance generated by the python script image 2 also brics being formed and trying to reform a gold standard and china is continuously adding to their gold holdings lastly it can be seen that there is a large ascending triangle pattern formed and the last time this happened for the stock large upward movements were generated the pattern suggests a move to 21212229 between the time frame of 0552023 06192023 all of these things in combination especially with the current state of fed being stuck with choosing between increasing rates and causing more bank pain see image 4 federal reserve report that at thirdquarter end 722 banks had already reported unrealized losses exceeding 50 of capital or stopping hikesreducing rates and letting inflation run rampant support a bullish case for gold and gold miners such as barrick with their leadership sees a strong next quarter ahead

the jet blue spirit airlines merger lottery ticket jet blue is trying to buy spirit airlines if the deal concludes spirit shareholders will receive $31 in cash per share they are also receiving $010 per month per share while waiting for the deal to conclude $save is currently at $11 so a huge gap to the deal price why so large the doj sued to block it on antitrust grounds and the trial is currently ongoing additionally spirit is having some real financial pressure see the last earnings report and if the merger fails may face restructuring the trial has not yet produced many clues about which way it will go although the recent antitrust trial record is poor buying $save may present a real binary 1 or 0 outcome a real lottery ticket calls unsurprisingly have a high iv 150 but if you think spirit is a big fat zero without the merger or you want gambling leverage they may be the way to go merger information can be found here strangely $jblu stock has been beaten down worse than other airlines as expected if the market thinks the expected merger will happen but $save is priced like the market doesn t believe the deal happens very odd mismatch

cmv if a company does not allow work from home they are a bad bet for longterm investing they may be able to function in the short term five years or so but beyond that their tech debt will be astronomical from hiring and maintaining subpar candidates and yes i am inferring that only subpar candidates would be willing to work in an office while some decent employees may still be going in now it s just a matter of time before they realize their worth and abandon ship additionally workers are more efficient produce fewer errorsbugs and are less likely to take sickfmlaltd if i had any long positions in companies that specifically forbade working from home i d reconsider beyond the aforementioned points it shows a clear lack of responsible leaders who are not weighing the longterm cost vs benefits of that decision echo this point across the internet leaders against workfromhome policies are bad for shareholder value

82622 spy es futures and apple weekly market analysis well today a lot of people realize they had a plan for what if jpow rallies us 3 to 430 but not many of us had a what if jpow tanks us 3 and we see 405 today today will probably go down as one of the wildest trading days ive seen in a while that 10am candle opened dropped nearly $4 recovered $4 almost and then started the sell off with a bigger sell off after it that candle was even more dramatic then most fomc moves are today we closed out at almost 102 mil volume which is about 160 of the 30day average this is a massive volume day and is the highest volume since june 30th which was 112mil usually we consider large volume days to be bearish days so this type of volume really could be signaling something much bigger is coming downside wise okay so where are we at as of this morning i was working under the assumption of us trading within that blue downward channel however as you can see we broke through that end of day today the big things that happen is we broke back through the daily 8 200 20 100 and 50ema so we now have closed below all of those levels being back below all the emas hasn t happened since the lows of july we broke through key level support of 4175 and from there we bounced and closed right on the next level support of 4052 i mentioned we should start playing level to level so breaking 4175 we should have expected 4052 of course not in the same day but if and when we break and close below 4052 i will look for 391 as our next major support for a bounce however if we double bottom at 4052 we could start back toward 4175 the daily candle is a massive bearish engulfing candle that not only engulfed the previous days candle but the whole week and 62 of this whole months trading range we did not completely fill the 42122 gap this morning as we only reached 41996 before we saw the major downturn at 10am the next gap below is down to 37857 so something interesting that i mentioned earlier this week is that if we are assuming august 16th and 43173 is the ultimate top of the bear market rally we should look for 3743 and september 16th as the next possible bottom however we could see a range anywhere from 3885 to 3626 fun fact cpi is on september 13th too and the next fomc meeting is september 20th there is a potential that we could see the next big bear market sell off and it could lead us right into cpi fomc or those could be what takes us to the bottom interestingly enough on spy weekly we did not break through the 11 week long bull channel we actually bounce just short of support which woulda been right at the weekly 100ema of 4042 however unless spy plans to open over 40991 11 green and never lose that support all week we will see that level broken on monday that would be the confirmation we need to suspect the next level down major supports to watch next week 4052 daily level 4042 weekly 100ema 390 weekly and daily support level major resistance to watch next week 4075 daily 50ema 4127 weekly resistance level 4175 daily resistance level my overall thoughts are if we close below 405 on monday that its safe to assume we see 390 before 4175 again if we hold 405 then we might try and retake 4175 first the most likely scenario for monday is an inside day where we trade within the previous days range and then tuesday make a big move futures daily is the same story we broken through all the levels and closed back below all the emas for first time since the lows of july key support 4020 3922 3865 key resistance 4075 4100 4130 4157 futures weekly actually did hit the 11 week long bull support line and did as of right now break the weekly 100ema of 4050 again unless futures opens big green monday and hold 4092 all day long and week long we will be through support which should signify a confirmed downward move towards 3906 key weekly support 3906 key weekly resistance 4112 a lot going on here with apple so they closed with about 79mil volume which is the largest volume day since august 17th the peak apple also had the reddest close since june 16th the bottom i was watching a potential black bull channel within the bigger red bull channel but we fell through that support i was also watching a blue bear channel that we also fell through that support so lets clean up this chart as of right now the potential bull channel resistance using the june 8th and august 17th high with the low of june 16th and june 30th for support we have a potential down side for friday at 158 for apple apple also closed back below its daily 8 and 20ema apple almost filled its upped gap leaving about 25 cents there that could be considered filled tho and it also filled its lower gap today the next gap on apple is at 15764 and should be a potential target for next week if we start to breakout upward we will look to that blue resistance line now established for rejection key daily support 1632 1608 1581 1555 key daily resistance 1649 1675 1687 the apple weekly actually gives a pretty good breakdown of where things are headed the weekly gap is almost filled and would be okay to go unfilled the rest of the way from here we should test the red bull channel support at 154 next week once we would lose 154 it should a clear down side to 120s 130s key weekly support 161 1575 1541 key weekly resistance 1665 1722 1762 i actually really like apple for a level to level play also here using these weekly levels so once 161 breaks look for 1574 the vix is the true winner today with a crazy 1726 day the vix broke through all the major resistance levels and closed back in the 255 to 347 zone if this can hold this level on monday i would look for vix to take us to 347 and eventually take spy back to 360s370s however if vix were to lose 255 on monday or any day next week then we will look for it to end up back in the green zone form 187 to 255 so you guys are probably asking whats the play what would i do am i long or short on anything well honestly i wouldn t open or hold anything after a massive 34 day like this you have to think about it like this i know many of you were in 30 and 60dte puts and i know many of those were up 200500 depending on when you opened it would you rather close out a 200 gainer and open a new position of the same size for pretty much free since your win paid for it or would you rather hold till monday and take the chance the markets slap the bear and we get a 3 green day and erase everything that happened today you have to secure profits you can not let profits like that slip away we are meeting the criteria that makes me think we are going to see the next major sell off the one thing that will continue to hold me up is what is the catalyst for the sell off to continue markets have known all of this info for months now and now all of a sudden they wanna act shocked is this just a massive over reaction and now we rally till cpi actually gives us a selling point followed by fomc or is this actually the start of the next sell off i am not someone who enjoys swings because i feel like my timing is never quite there yes i know i can predict things pretty well but seems like whenever i take a long swing im early or way late the better play here is to wait for bottom and then play the rise back up with calls market will naturally and way more aggressively rise markets need a reason to sell off though but the play i would consider is vix $25 spy $405 and apple $163 on monday at market close and we should expect to see vix 30 spy $390 and apple $155158 within the next week or two 10 challenge this week for me felt like one of those weeks where you just beat yourself i had two trades this week that i let go red i also had two trades that tos screwed me on one was a 15 stop limit that didn t fill and the other was a 8 winner then filled at 1 thats four winners i should have had this week not excuses but that s how i look at it had i gotten those 4 winners 2 definitely my fault i would have ended up with 88 win rate and at least $1000 this week i beat myself this week is how i see it but next week is a new week and monday is a new day to do better this market is chewing up and spitting people out left and right this market is all about capital preservation we have to think long term 2022 is probably the hardest market any of us will trade in and probably the hardest day trading we will do for the rest of our careers if you can survive 2022 profitable or not but just don t capitulate out you will someday be hella prosperous this is a marathon not a sprint youtube will be up late tonight having a movie night with the kiddos hope you guys have a great weekend

dd on fubotv hello everyone please check these numbers that i ve calculated after carefully studying the balance sheet and business model of fubo also please note that i m not a financial advisor nor a professional trader and anything you read here must be doubled checked by yourself or your financial advisor before entering any trade numbers on this post may be wrong as i may have miscalculated them and it s your duty to double check everything fubo has now increased their base package from 6499 to 6999 if you check the financial statement of the company don t forget to account for $5 more per subscriber to calculate and reach the same numbers if fubo grows ads revenue from $8 to $12 per user with 3m subs break even the company becomes profitable 5m subs $240my profit 10m subs $480my from $8 to $16 which is close to the ceos target 3m subs $144my 5m subs $480my 10m subs $920my these calculations don t account for gambling revenue at all fubo didn t reveal enough data yet to calculate it ads revenue per user could possibly grow even more than $16 the cpm for tv ads has been growing every year the current cpm at fubo is $21 this has been disclosed in a tv interview the current ad revenue per user per month is $8 proof with $20 per user which could be achieved by 2026 the numbers are looking even better for fubo as 3m subs $288my profit 5m subs $720my 10m subs $14by now let s just consider that we reach the target of $16 only without gambling because it didn t work out as expected to have some conservative estimates let s calculate the pe for $16 ad revenue per user for fubo 5m subs pe 12 $576b market cap 500 upside pe 24 $1152b market cap 1000 upside pe 36 $1728b market cap 1500 upside fubo is also a potential take over target for giant companies like amazon and apple that are trying to grow their online streaming offers like amazon prime video and apple tv fubo has locked in rights for some nfl matches until 2030 fubo has been the fastest growing streaming company in 2021 while youtubetv and hulu lagged behind in terms of new subscribers fubo s ceo said previously that his ad system was not yet performing at maximum capacity as they were still developing a new bid system once finished the ad revenue is expected to increase fubo s has acquired molotov a french startup for their dev team as they were unable to find engineers in the usa in france engineers are twice as cheap and just as good as american engineers fubo has now a technological advantage they also acquired edisn an ai company to be able to recognize in real time what is happening on the tv this technology alone is a game changer for interactive television fubo has been acquiring gambling licenses all over the us and are expecting to launch the sportsbook in several new states the first state which is iowa has been profitable since day one it s a very small state but ytd fubo has been quite profitable with a 10 net profit from bets you can check everything here open the pdf and search for fubo fubo also has a short interest close to 25 at the moment which could potentially squeeze the stock bear thesis bears believe fubo can t be profitable because until today they had negative margins they didn t take into account the recent price increase from $6499 to $6999 and the growing ad revenue per user once you take into account everything you start to realize that fubo can be very profitable keep in mind all of these calculations are without gambling revenue because i m not here to sell you a dream to try to make a buck but to give you a realist view of what is going on at fubo bears also keep saying that the ceo has sold shares yes he did sell some shares because his salary is quite small and he was all in on fubo the ceo still hold 1 569 819 shares i ve also posted part of this to twitter this is my original research disclaimer i m long fubo shares and cfds i don t intent to buy nor sell any fubo shares in the next 14 days

the hedgies are catching on to us about cramer obviously jim cramer is one of the worst stock traders of all time every time he likes a stock it tanks now that it is very obvious to retail investors that you short everything he likes the hedgies are trying some reverse psychology the day he rang the bell a lot of people shorted everything they could last night he liked tesla today everyone s puts ate shit now that the hedgies have caught on maybe cramer s picks will pump or maybe the stock market is retarded and a glorified casino and maybe we should stop speculating on what jim cramer says also sorry to the retard that lost $180k on trying to shorting tesla after he saw cramer s tweet and thought it couldn t possibly go tits up you ll make it back up there with that $149

bearish earnings dd on etsy etsy reports earnings tonight after close i expect them to report bad numbers and have bought puts yesterday the marketplace is stagnating and only increasing revenue thanks to higher fees since the first quarter of 2022 etsy has faced declining rates in their gross merchandise sales in the latest quarter they managed 3 annual growth but gms was still flat compared to q3 of 2021 meaning 0 growth in 2 years they reacted quickly by increasing seller fees in q2 of 2022 which you can clearly see on the chart led to a bump in their revenue growth rates while there were very public seller protests against the fee increase etsy ultimately went through with it and predictably all sellers remained on the platform that s because etsy has become the no1 marketplace for the kinds of goods they sell so there really wasn t a good alternative for any of their sellers sellers bit the bullet and stayed with the website competition from tiktok enter tiktok which has quickly become an extremely viable channel for typical etsy products the video format and discovery options on tiktok lend themselves perfectly to products typically sold on etsy you can stumble on a video showing something cute and homemade and immediately purchase the item through tiktok here s a quote from an etsy seller on their forums from october 29 2023 i don t have a tiktok but i know a few sellers in my category that do and are killing it with sales i agree we need something live here on etsy to compete the video and live formats on tiktok are simply much more appealing to modern customers compared to etsy which essentially works the same way as amazon popular etsy products are increasing in popularity on tiktok while etsy doesn t disclose their sales by product category we can make an educated guess by visiting their best selling items website as well as other websites that make estimates without being able to quantify them these are some of the best selling product categories on etsy jewelry beads pendants etc pins stickers books tshirts tiktok has offered these creators amazing terms by taking only a 2 commission on each sale compared to 65 at etsy and paying for discounts on the products the screenshots show how search interest on tiktok has developed for some popular hashtags related to these product categories in the usa all screenshots show global search interest over the past 3 years another sign of tiktok s increasing popularity in this space is that they will be increasing their own fees on sales soon to 6 per sale by april 1 and 8 by july 1 which would be even higher than etsy s fees tiktok s parent company bytedance is highly profitable so it stands to reason that this move is not made out of desperation but because they feel like they have taken a large amount of market share in this space the total market for these sorts of custom goods is quite limited and in my opinion not growing that quickly overall my assumption is that any sale made on tiktok for these goods is a sale that etsy is losing and this seems to be supported by data etsy metrics are declining while etsy continued to be a popular holiday destination for shoppers their iphone download rank has plummeted in the new year compared to q1 of 2023 website hits for etsycom decreased by 57 yoy in the past 3 months as per similarweb unfortunately i cannot show the data since i wrote down last years website views by hand and similarweb only shows the past 3 months to free users risks a well known activist investor recently took a large stake in etsy there s a risk that they could announce shareholder friendly steps during the earnings call such as stock buybacks divestitures etc since the stake was only announced at the beginning of february 2024 i think the likelihood of concrete actions being announced is however low my position strike 70 puts expiring this week as always you can go closer to the current stock price to minimize your risk iv on etsy is not particular high with a 51 implied move in either direction

dd uranium sector come glow with me hello wsb as promised from this evening s uranium cage match here is my uranium sector dd in this discussion i will be exploring the uranium sector as a whole where things currently stand what uranium is what it s used for why uranium has a good setup for the future and how you can get into uranium should you choose to i ve been looking into this sector for over a year now and have done more hours of research than i could count before i get into anything i want to emphasize this is a long term play this is not about buying weekly calls this is not a squeeze this is an investment in a growing sector that should provide significant returns in the next few years but these returns could be massive and it is by far my highest conviction play uranium is the one trade i will comfortable say isn t a question of if i m going to make money it s when i m going to make money and if you know me you ll know i don t make such bold statements alright let s begin uranium what is it and why should i care many of you have probably heard of uranium it s that green glowing rock that kills you if you go near it and makes a godzilla right nope first it s brown not green second it s actually not very radioactive out of the ground it needs a bunch of stuff done to it before it becomes that glowing stick thing you see on the simpsons for those interested here s a how it s made episode showing uranium from mining to being turned into nuclear fuel rods but how it s made isn t as important as its use a fuel source uranium is used to power nuclear powerplants plain and simple that s its use and before you go pfft nuclear is dead waste of time understand nuclear is actually more important than you realize as of today the usa gets 18 of it s electrical generation from nuclear yes 18 that s not a small amount at all and globally nuclear accounts for 10 of global electrical generation so the idea that nuclear is dead isn t correct it s too important right now to be dead unless you think the world is going to just go into full blackouts nuclear globally isn t being shut down in the next decade no matter how badly some nations want to you need only look at germany to see the results of that they went all out shutting down reactors starting in 2011 it s now 2022 and they just finished turning off the final reactor 11 years for them to replace their nuclear and they re having energy issues from it so don t tell me the usa is going to shut down it s nuclear and replace it with wind and solar in a few years it s just too complicated for the usa to replace 18 of its entire electrical generation no matter how much wind and solar is built i actually like wind and solar mind you on top of being a major energy source nuclear is carbon neutral nuclear and wind have the lowest carbon generation per kwh 70 times less than coal not only is it low carbon it s highly energy efficient one uranium fuel pellet will generate as much energy as one ton of coal 149 gallons of oil or 1700 cubic feet of natural gas what this means you can store a ton of energy in a small space using nuclear for the usa that might not matter but for nations like japan that don t have as much space being able to store years of energy in just a few warehouses is significant past the efficiency nuclear is a baseload energy source unlike wind and solar this means it generates consistent amounts of reliable electricity 247 wind and solar can t do this sometimes it s not as windy sometimes it s not as sunny this matters because if you re building an electrical grid you need a certain amount of it to be providing a consistent predictable amount of energy otherwise you risk blackouts at certain periods electrical grids need baseload energy in order to ensure the lights stay on add in you can control how much electricity nuclear generates maybe it s really sunny you can have the nuclear powerplant spin down and produce less and rely more on solar that day when it s cloudy you can then go back to using the nuclear reactors at higher capacity and unlike wind and solar you can build a powerplant anywhere wind has to be somewhere with consistently high wind solar somewhere that has consistently high solar activity nuclear can be put wherever there s space downsides of nuclear while nuclear has many upsides there are of course downsides let s start with the giant radioactive elephant in the room nuclear meltdowns omg so scary right they happen and then millions of people die and stuff except that s not exactly true people are familiar with 3 major meltdowns chernobyl fukushima and 3 mile island let s do the easy one first 3 mile island had a grand total of 0 deaths or injuries i ll say that again 0 people were injured or died from 3 mile island nobody not just that but they got the leak under control quickly but that isn t a fun news story like powerplant leaking radiation you ll die if you don t tune in now so it s not the story that was told now onto chernobyl yes people died and the nearby land was ruined however this was a very special case see the ussr really didn t give a damn about the people of ukraine hey history is repeating when they build chernobyl like at all they wanted energy generation and skipped pretty much all safety regulations yes it was bad but nobody will ever be allowed to build a powerplant that unsafe and unregulated ever again because of it this was less nuclear bad and more neglecting any form of safety measures for any powerplant bad finally we have fukushima yes a big scary disaster but like 3 mile island nobody died from the meltdown now people died from the tsunami but there were no recorded deaths from radiation exposure there are some projected deaths from exposure that could cause cancer later but that s entirely theoretical in reality that meltdown despite again the news telling you it was the worst thing ever has directly killed 0 people to this day add in it took a historically large earthquake and the powerplant regulators ignoring a key safety measure moving the generators off the bottom floor which they had been told to do for years i don t want to downplay these events but they re not the world ending disasters the news likes to pretend they were in fact nuclear has the one of the lowest death per kwh of any energy source but again it doesn t make a good news story so why would you ever hear about that add in new nuclear powerplants being much safer and having many fail safes fun fact fukushima was actually older than chernobyl take the zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant in ukraine russia recently bombed this powerplant during an assault everyone was freaking out know what happened nothing why because nuclear powerplant reactors are build with a protective core designed to take a direct impact from a fully fueled 767 and yes they have actually conducted this exact experiment so it s not just in theory they re a lot safer than people realize next downside the cost nuclear powerplants are expensive to build and a lot of companies don t want to build them it takes 10 years of operating for a powerplant to just break even that s a scary investment and a lot of companies won t do it but there are new powerplants being built the us recently has 2 new powerplants finish in georgia and is working on extending the lifetime of current powerplants including diablo canyon the last powerplant in california which the governor has requested a 20 year life extension for and it looks like he s going to get it that s right even super green california is now changing their tune about nuclear but it s not just the usa germany has started talking about delaying the shutdown of their remaining powerplants they probably won t but the fact germany is even willing to discuss the idea shows a huge sentiment shift japan s new ruling party has made restarting their nuclear fleet shut down since fukushima a top priority with plans for several reactors to come back online by summer 2023 india south korea romania france all have plans for new reactors even bill gates is working in wyoming on creating new safer small modular reactors smrs then there s china china has committed to building 150 new reactors over the next decade yes 150 reactors or 15 reactors a year simply put nuclear isn t going away and even seems to be growing now even gretta thunberg has come out in favor of nuclear but what about all that nuclear fuel surely the spent fuel rods are a problem right i mean everyone says we can t store them and they ll melt your face except there s not nearly as much of it as you think all the nuclear fuel generated in the usa one of the largest users of nuclear on the planet would fit inside of a single football field and only be 10 feet deep yep just one football field to store all the spent nuclear fuel ever generated by the usa since they started having power plants in the 1950 s the reality is every dangerous thing you ve heard about nuclear is the result of a very carefully planned ad campaign put out by oil and gas companies who were terrified nuclear would replace them and set out to fund multiple anti nuclear movements i want to be clear i am by no means saying nuclear is perfect but there has been a lot of money spent to convince you it s a lot more dangerous than it is and if i wanted to i could make major cases against any energy source and the dangers it possesses heck you drive in cars that are literally filled with explosive gasoline that your engine constantly blows up in tiny controlled explosions that could 100 kill you if they got out of control we just don t describe cars like that because it s a silly dramatization of the reality but that s exactly how nuclear is presented ok so nuclear will exist who cares so we ve established two things nuclear currently exists at a level too large to shut down anytime soon and places aren t just not shutting it down they re adding even more now we get to the money part see that uranium used to power a nuclear powerplant it has a problem it s too cheap how cheap today uranium sells for $52pound but it costs a mining company $65$70 pound to mine it yes companies currently lose $14$18pound mining uranium but why would they mine it if they re losing money is probably your question well for most companies they re not they have shut down all mining and are waiting for prices to go higher this has created a major deficit in supply currently 190 million pounds of uranium are used per year globally while only 140 million pounds are mined that s a 25 yearly supply deficit that has been going on for 3 years now now you might ask how is that possible to understand this you need to understand first how long it takes to convert uranium into a fuel rod this process takes between 1824 months to complete for this reason reactors have to keep a large amount of nuclear fuel in different forms on hand on average they ll have about 2 years worth of fuel on site some ready to user right away some a few months away from being usable some needing nearly the full 2 year cycle this secures them supply should something go wrong with their expected delivery well remember 2011 when fukushima hit japan shut down all their nuclear powerplants with no restart date powerplants that were now sitting on 2 years or more of fuel they were never going to use guess what they did with that fuel they sold it and this created a brand new uranium market not only was the market flooded with cheap uranium but traders could now buy uranium to resell to utilities at much lower prices than a mine could they didn t have all the capex of running a mine and staffing it they just needed to pay for storage until they could deliver it to a utility this destroyed the price of uranium just look at the chart below showing uranium price starting in 2011 x200b see that giant price drop from $50 down to a low of under $20 that s all that japanese supply flooding the market but that was over a decade ago that supply is running out not only is it starting to run out japan is restarting their reactors as stated above meaning they re going from a net seller to a buyer of uranium all that cheap supply utilities could buy up is disappearing and all the traders are running out of supply to resell and this isn t just in theory check out this video it is an interview with the man who manages nuclear fuel buying for several utilities in it he says starting this year he is havng more trouble than he s had in a long time finding supply orders he used to get done in months now would take him near a year and when the uranium supply starts to run low the price moves up and moves fast let s see another graph from 2007 x200b see that giant price spike that s from supply going away specifically from the usa ending their program of decommissioning nuclear weapons which gave a cheap supply of uranium for powerplants to buy that same thing is about to happen in the uranium sector all the cheap japanese uranium has been bought and they re done selling the traders are having a harder and harder time finding new supply to resell this is going to cause another price spike and the mining companies are going to thrive see as stated earlier most of these companies are not mining what this means is they re sitting waiting for the price to get to a level worth mining and then they ll start selling now in the uranium sector selling is done through a contract with utilities usually these contracts are signed for 10 years with a price range a bottom price so the mines don t get screwed and a top price so utilities don t get screwed as of today most companies don t have any contracts but as the supply runs out utilities are going to be forced to talk to the miners and sign these long term contracts and this isn t just theoretical cameco ccj the 2nd largest uranium mining company in the world announced in january they had signed 40 million usd in new contracting that month which was more than they did for the entire year of 2021 previously closed down us mines from are being restarted this year with plans to deliver into recently signed contracts starting in summer of 2023 and as these contracts come it s going to ramp up because the uranium sector has one other key thing it s small tiny how small the entire uranium sector has a market cap less than that of hersheys yes the chocolate company has a larger market cap than all the uranium mining companies combined not only is the sector tiny you can count on two hands all the companies currently able to mine uranium and as for the ones trying to build a mine the fastest ones expect to be running in 2024 at best here s another chart for you x200b this chart shows the total projected uranium mining compared to the demand out to 2040 see that red space above that s a deficit where demand beats out supply here s the thing about this chart it assumes a full restart of all existing mines and all planned uranium mines yes even if every single mine and planned mine came online on time with full production there would still be a huge deficit and uranium mines do not have near a 100 start rate more like a 10 chance for a company to go from discovering uranium to actually getting a functioning mine and understand something about uranium it is an inelastic fuel you can t substitute anything for uranium either you have it or you can t run your power plant and not running isn t an option as it costs $12 million per day to shut down a reactor utilities can and will pay huge amounts to get their fuel supply this is because uranium is a fraction of the cost of a powerplant it accounts for just 5 of their operational costs that s it so a powerplant can have the price of uranium shoot up and see minimal impact the analogy i like to use think of a steak dinner the steak is what s expensive now do you put salt on the steak sure but do you care what the salt costs if tomorrow salt did a 10x on price would you stop eating steak no because salt is dirt cheap so who cares what it costs the same holds for uranium and even if the price goes through the roof governments will subsidize before they allow blackouts because that s what the entire uranium sector really boils down to uranium sells for too little to the point where one of two things must happen either the price of uranium will go up to at least $65$70pound to get mines back online or when you flick a light switch in the usa in 5 years the lights will not work that s the bet you re making which one do you think is more likely to happen sprott and uranium i m going to take a quick second to talk about one other factor in the uranium sector sprott for those of you unfamiliar sprott is a resource investment fund run by a man named eric sprott he runs large physical funds that let investors buy shares which he then uses to buy physical gold or silver very simple system you buy some shares he buys some gold you can sell your shares or ask for payment of gold in an amount equal to your shares well he s doing this exact same thing for uranium minus the delivery part sorry guys you can t get uranium sent to your home the system is the same you buy shares his company uses that money to buy physical uranium which they store in a warehouse but here s the thing this is not a resell system sprott gets paid per transaction they buy an amount and keep 1 of the purchasing fee for themselves that s how they make money they do not resell this uranium in fact there currently is no system to resell the uranium in place what this means there is a system in place currently taking in millions of pounds of uranium off the market that will not resell this takes a deficit and adds even more pressure since now sprott is buying up supply from utilities additionally this added something the uranium market desperately needed price discovery for the longest time the spot market was kept at very low prices as uranium was seldom traded but sprott brought a consistent uranium buyer to the market when they came in uranium was trading at $30pound through their bids the price now sits at $50pound they helped create a consistent bidder keeping the spot price at realistic levels that reflect the true market not depressed levels traders used to better negotiate short term deals so what do i do ah the big question what do you do with this information well you find uranium miners you like and buy shares or leaps at least 1 year out though ideally 2 why because this is a very simple play the price of uranium must go up or the lights will go out and there s no way the world is choosing the lights going out so the question is not if the price of uranium will go up to at least match the inventive price and get mines back online rather the question is when will the price go up so you play the miners and wait because at some point we will see utilities rushing to secure supply and when that happens these miners are going to rocket with it now a couple of things to understand because this sector is so small it can rocket but those rockets go both ways when money is flowing in stocks can jump quick but when money flows out when oh i don t know the entire stock market is selling off money flows out quickly too and that s exactly what happened to uranium over the last summer it s was selling off hard not too shocking as summer is often a historically bad time for uranium utility coes are on vacation and won t be thinking about supply until mid october when nuclear fuel conferences are held recently the stocks have been doing better but there s one thing you can trust in a uranium market before it launches it ll give you a couple good fake out runs but it s also really good at giving you a few fake out dumps too i would not be shocked if some of these companies saw a 20 drop before a true bull market began because tiny markets can be sold off real quick especially if retail gets scared while the bigger players sit back and wait for deals i would not throw all my cash into this trade at once rather i would slowly scale in pick what you like and position but be prepared to have to handle a few big pull backs take a look at this company s stock movement over the last uranium bull market x200b there s a lot of big up periods but there s also some nasty down swings but in the end it gave a 50x return on the investment but would you have made it there or would you have sold in march after a 42 stock move or maybe the 2nd sell off in april of 40 because that s the thing about this market if you re gonna play you better be prepared for some real pain along the ride or try and swing trade it if you want just know when it launches up it s fast and you can easily be left behind quick notes just a quick addressing of some things i tend to hear asked throium reactors are a thing being worked on but they aren t ready yet and won t be for decades even when done they can t do a 100 uranium replacement overnight it ll take years i like them but it s future tech fusion is also being worked on but that s even further out future tech it s been 20 years away for 50 years now yes wind and solar exist i like them i think they re great but as of today they are energy that needs to exist with nuclear not replace it the tech again just isn t there yet yes new companies can build a uranium mine and uranium isn t that rare heck you can mine uranium from sea water and companies have a way to do it if uranium hits $200 a pound that is however building a mine is a long and difficult process especially to get permits most nations are very strict about allowing a company to mine uranium because of what it is as such you need to show not just you know how to mine it you can do it safely and without impacting the environment that can take near 10 years and often takes that long if not longer so yeah when prices spike new companies will pop up but they ll be a decade or more out from actually mining anything and this assumes they can even find staff who know how to run a uranium mine which is not easy to find and get permits so that s the gist of the uranium sector and why i feel it s a good place to park some money for the next few years it s got a good future to it it s not going anywhere and in fact shows strong signs of growing and it s needed tldr uranium accounts for 18 of us electrical generation it costs mines $65 to mine and only sells for $52 so companies aren t mining

psa for noobs old timers investors or not regarding $bbby i just want to say i m fairly new to wsb but i am not new to the stock market in the short time i ve been in this subreddit i ve noticed far to many inexperienced people using funds they shouldn t to invest in bbby i am a bag holderwith 4600 shares $1030 and i am aware of all the possible factors that can swing this stock one way or another if you re on wsb and literally taking financial advice from a post that more than likely has not financial advice implied in it then you need to take a step back and re evaluate what you are doing there are numerous factors that will fluctuate a stock price in the case of $bbby an extremely volatile meme stock the news these posts bear investors and bull investors alike hedges retail the company itself all can play a factor in it and that s not half of it if you seen a post that said something like rc is gonna colab with bbby and send this thing to the moon and you took that in stride and put $$$ into bbby that s on you that s on you for believing that miracle could happen if you got into bbby because you knew there was an announcement coming and thought the stock price would sky rocket on and after that day likely because of a post you seen that s on you i ve seen to many posts yesterday and today bashing people saying i trusted you they said this thing was gonna moon was there a chance that the news was gonna be bullish and be a catalyst for sending the price to the moon of course there also was a chance it wasn t gonna do that nothing in trading stocks is a sure thing you can sometimes calculate factors in and do your research and potentially better your odds for whatever you re investing in but it will never be 100 a sure thing this is why you often see people compare the stock market to a casino because it s often a gamble except sometimes you can do research and increase your odds all that being said i d like to explain what got me to invest in the bbby play and what s keeping me in it i didn t invest in bbby because of some miracle news on aug 28th i didn t invest because of the unknown i bought into bbby after rc got out why because it was then i looked into the numbers behind bbbys ticker bbby is roughly over 100 shorted at the moment if you don t know what that means or don t know how to find out how much short interest is i advise you to take a step back and do some research put some fat on your brain before investing bbby as of tomorrow will be on regsho for 13 consecutive days meaning the hedges that are playing short are obligated to buy their failure to delivers ftd this t13 starts friday tomorrow this does not mean that the price will drastically go up i say this for all the noobs that look at this post for financial advice if you don t know what ftds are or what regsho is then i again suggest you take a step back learn research anyways t35 days on regsho the market makers responsible for any outstanding ftds are forced to buy them if the number of ftds are in the millions then it could increase the stock price of bbby on top of all of that the news that was released on wednesday was in fact good news it wasn t the miracle some people were hoping for but overall it was most definitely good news i m not gonna go over what the news was because i m not making this post to convince anyone into putting money into something i don t want that on my conscience i m just explaining why i myself am investing in bbby in theory with the bullish news and the regsho guidelines the price of bbby should be more than it is now by end of month i shouldn t have to say this but i will this is not financial advice sincerely sorry for the running sentences i m not sure how reddit posting works when it comes to trying to form correct paragraphs t35 visualized tldr you should read into things before diving in head first also bbby bullish

pirate gang zimagain betting on red sea conflict i previously posted in january about a series of theses around the macro and micro environment supporting zim with some crazy movements around a high gamma jan expiry ended up slightly down despite some really nice upside volatility as always the greed kills well anyways now i m back again and loaded up for the q4 earnings report coming in two weeks most of my predictions have come true with conflict and damages escalating and now despite the extremely bullish positioning the stock has maintained muted performance a phenomenal beat setup i expect this to dramatically update as investors finally come to terms with the severity and extended length of disruption i very strongly recommend reading the original thesis to understand why my conviction remains intact largely the core business fundamentals remain unchanged cash position high short positions decent options gamma etc and conflict has proceeded within my expectations below i address the impact of recent news and events updated risk scenarios and additional catalysts tldr red sea positive catalysts high probability of extended disruption extreme fcf 05epswk 25$sh cash position panama canal heavily shorted fundamentals zim is heavily leveraged to spot container rates which have soared by 200 since the initial disruptions began in december any conversation about valuing zim primarily comes down to perspectives on future spot rates and taking into account the existing cash position zim currently maintains 25$share in cash q3 earnings page 9 don t double count lease liabilities 185b current cash 125b long term treasuries forgot the treasuries in my original post so even at 0$ eps their effective book value increases as the high lease liabilities naturally run through to double emphasize the above even in the bear case of rates returning to original levels the downside side is limited by the crazy cash position zim has built this setup is perfect for asymmetric high upside low downside bets at current spot rates zim is earning 0405epswk which have been elevated for 8wks at this point while the q4 eps is expected to be negative 15sh my expected q1 eps of 56sh more than offsets this in the scenario where rates remain elevated just through q2 then zim will have fully returned its existing market cap if rates keep up the rest of the year then zim will have earned an unheard of 2x market cap in profits clearly everything depends on how long these rates can remain disrupted some bears will rightfully point out the significant supply overhang of container newbuilds in 20242025 despite the increased supply the disruptions listed below have fully absorbed the impact and along with timeline slippage additional ecofriendly regulations reducing speedsupply and expected scrapping i expect rates to be significantly less impacted by these compared to the macro geopolitical disruptions currently at stake ex lunar new year container seaonality usually causes a massive rate decrease at this time of year but rates have remained bullish and elevated throughout why now at this point given today s price action the stock has already baked in significant expectations of negative effects from a ceasefire i believe these are overblown and expand on why in the following section case for extended disruptions and elevated rates zim along with the rest of the shipping stocks fell dramatically during a false announcement deleted tweet from qatar of an israelhamas ceasefire in early february and has maintained muted pricing ever since the current investor rhetoric appears risk averse from fears of a similar drop in the case of a true ceasefire announcement as a result zim is priced in with a sentiment shift towards beliefs in a shortlived conflict and bearish rate perspectives i have several reasons why i believe this to not be the case 1 in the earlystages the russiaukraine war also had similar political and media rhetoric around ceasefires and peace agreements which has recently extended past two years of prolonged conflict 2 netanyahu has been extremely adamant about terms in the current discussions with hamas and given the publicly touted agendas of both groups a shortlived temporary ceasefire appears to be the most likely outcome if they come to agreement i am skeptical vessels would reroute through the red sea knowing ceasefire is limited to a 46 week period see 5 3 the houthis are an independent group unassociated with hamas backed by iran who s mission statement includes disrupting western institutions while the public statements claim to justify the attacks as support for gaza given the effectiveness of their attacks it appears extremely likely they d continue operations even in the case of an israelpalestine ceasefire the recent global economic effects have shown how much leverage they have and it seems disadvantageous for them to give this up this is the biggest reason why i believe ceasefire risk is overstated in the context of red sea shipping lanes 4 israel is increasingly likely to be engaged with hezbollah an additional war front with hezbollah will dramatically escalate the regional conflict and extend the duration of conflict read 612months likewise this will further any moral justifications the houthi s need for continued disruptions in the red sea my current rationale is that if this does happen then nothing will stop zim from generating 2x market cap in earnings over the next year at 10 odds of initiated hezbollah conflict this is an extremely attractive asymmetric bet 5 a significant operational cost of shipping comes from vessel insurance which has spiked dramatically or is even unavailable for red sea crossings the recently sunkdamaged ships and commentary on the ineffectiveness of defensive escorts have proved that houthi interventions are serious and effective this gives additional credence to point 3 and fiscally encourages taking longer routes 6 shipping liners as an industry have cartellike incentives when it comes to supply and demand this largely comes into play in the forward looking process of ordering container newbuilds scrapping aged portions of the fleet and balancing the expected changes in supply and demand this is a super inelastic market with small imbalances resulting in massive 210x rate shifts now they have an additional group incentive to keep the status quo of routing around the cape as it artificially reduces ton mile supply and increases the entire industry s margins while morally justifying cartel behavior in the name of crew safety 7 the panama canal is a major shipping route which has experienced massive capacity reductions due to droughts and falling elevation levels many ships are experiencing dramatically extended wait times causing a supply shock to the industry and providing another spot rate catalyst rainfall and elevation predictions imply that this will likely continue to cause slowdowns for the foreseeable future rain forecasts are always a bit noisy 8 there are risksensitivity and esgsociomoralpolitical apprehensions for why many investors and large passive flows avoid the shipping industry this in itself improves the chances of individual investors obtaining financial alpha by increasing one s risk and exposure tolerance personally i justify the moral concerns by donating portions of my capital to but this is wsb do whatever you feel comfortable with disclosure this is not financial advice please due your own due diligence i am not an advisor

elon musk considering bringing in partners on twitter bid sources say twitter s board may as well start preparing to hand the company over elon isn t going to give up on this if they do proceed with the poison pill they ll get sued into oblivion for diluting shareholders the only other alternative is a white knight investor swooping in paying much more than the company is worth which would be stupid from an investment perspective can t wait to see how all this plays out over the coming weeks disclaimer i have no stock positions in twitter i don t give a shit if it skyrockets or tanks nor do i care if elon takes over the company article here
why rc s form144 might make you excited facts 1 rc s form144 was filed on 20220817 050830 aka 5am see here 2 bbby s price began to suddenly tank at aug 17 2022 340 pm et 3 seeking alpha s article was published at aug 17 2022 408 pm et strange how 2 and 3 happened so close to each other but so long after 1but that s besides the point here is the thing that i see on 8162022 ryan cohen looked at his shares of bbby that he bought in march for an average of $1534 and decided it s going to be time to sell soon now of note after he bought those shares bbby was in the low $20s for about two weeks and yet at that time rc did not look at his shares and think gee i think i should sell so why now and not then it is my nonexpert opinion that he sees a massive upside to be had in the next 90 days and doesn t want to be stuck on the merrygoround while others are riding a rocket is his massive upside high$20s maybe maybe not his call strikes would suggest that he is looking at a different number again not an expert but at a share price of $15 without massive iv like there is atm the price of anything at $4050 strike is pretty darn similar so why buy so far oom tldr rc filed to sell rc may or may not have sold rc previously did not sell at $2022 rc s strike price of choice for oom calls was waaaay oom not just way oom either way bbby is still 50 short with 70 institutional ownership required i currently own only 1 call option for 123 just along for the ride

undervalued and potential for a squeeze the geo group $geo has 1165 million shares outstanding of that due to high insider and institutional holdings only about 10 million are available for trading 20 million shares short interest give it a 200 si $gme had si of 150 at its high not saying my calculated setup is a guarantee for a squeeze but a good start daily price swings on low volume indicate that the stock is tight as hell also $geo while still heavily leveraged has underlying assets that give the company a fair share price of about $20 based on reproduction values of recent transactions not even included here is their subsidiary which is a cash machine it s basically one of a few stocks that will hold up during a recession make their interest payments leverage less problematic relative to the increasing rates in general and provide a big margin of safety since the company provides enough fcf to deleverage and has enough assets to sell for deleveraging if you don t like the fact that geo also operates correction facilities spare me with your woke opinion it s about making money

palantirpltr time for another look before dd since its debut on the public market palantir s stock has underperformed expectations leaving many of us who bought into the initial hype facing disappointing returns in my assessment this lackluster performance is largely due to the prevailing economic downturn and the company s excessive stockbased compensation scheme for employees which has spurred institutional investors to withdraw their support it was prepared for the economic downturn palantir s latest earnings report as of march 31 2023 shows $2916 billion in cash no longterm debt indicating strong financial health and flexibility for growth investments acquisitions or shareholder returns this software is stickier than the backstage floor at a motley crue concert yearoveryear customer count increased by 41 and it grew by 7 compared to the previous quarter the number of us commercial customers saw a 50 rise yearoveryear moving from 103 customers in q1 2022 to 155 in q1 2023 palantir employees significant stake a catalyst for future success palantir has majorly cut its stockbased compensation from exceeding 100 of revenues to a mere 26 fostering institutional investment appeal while maintaining its ability to attract and retain highquality talent palantir is preparing to showcase its ai prowess via a live stream today at the same time a solution to the debt ceiling problem seems to be within reach meanwhile due to the unconvincing outlook from c3 investors may be prompted to search for a more promising option

elon musk is predictable here s a framework you can use pattern is simple anything that he does or any news that make him look bad he spin the story around to make himself look good short tesla you don t support climate change lose argument about rescuing children in a cave guy s a pedophile have sex with his employees cheat on his wife underpopulation crisis need to dump some stocks it s for buying twitter not buying twitter anymore too many bots flight attendant said elon musk exposed himself it s a political attack on his character abuse his employees he s just a hard worker who expects everyone else to be like him guy works so hard he s busy between attention whoring on twitter and having threesomes with amber heard but tbh if you are trading thank him because he prints money if you bought bitcorn tesla dog coin twitter early because of his tweets you have to thank him for all the easy money

how defense stocks telegraphed the israeli attack on october 7th alright regards hear me out there s a beautiful quote in reminiscences of a stock operator that i have come to have a deeper understanding and respect for the more i progress in my trading practice that is how i first came to take an interest in the message of the tape of course there is always a reason for fluctuations but the tape does not concern itself with the why and wherefore it doesn t go into explanations i didn t ask the tape why when i was fourteen and i don t ask it today at forty the reason for what a certain stock does today may not be known for two or three days or weeks or months but what the dickens does that matter your business with the tape is now not tomorrow the reason can wait but you must act instantly or be left you ll remember that hollow tube went down three points the other day while the rest of the market rallied sharply that was the fact on the following monday you saw that the directors passed the dividend that was the reason they knew what they were going to do and even if they didn t sell the stock themselves they at least didn t buy it there was no inside buying no reason why it should not break reminiscences of a stock operator edwin lefevre early in my career i completely dismissed technical analysis technical analysis sounds too good to be true actually you can predict the future by drawing lines on a chart what that s it no calculus no reading balance sheets and income statements all you need is a freaking crayon and a piece of paper well yes and no part of the reason why i dismissed it is that ta seems too good to be true like you d find magic beans and technical analysis of the financial markets being sold next to each other on a shelf in an alley shop from what i can tell refusal to accept ta as a legitimate technique is because laymen believe it is a prediction tool when it could be more accurately described as a probability tool that said i wanted to share what i suspect to be a true life example of the tape telegraphing something on september 28th helene meisler tweeted that defense stocks were up while the broader markets were down and asked what do they know she then speculated in a later tweet she thinks people are betting that congress was going to authorize additional funding i dismissed this as an anomaly x200b then october 7th happened the market rallied but defense stocks rallied even harder x200b xar defense etf spy sp 500 etf looking in retrospect there were anomalies everywhere the volume in xar and spy were wildly different xar rallied 3 days from 925 to 927 when spy fell xar showed significantly greater volume growth on 109 than spy did from 929 105 candlesticks shrank much more significantly for xar than for spy xar showed a bull flag formation from 106 to 1026 that confirmed on 1031 during all the moves from 925 through 1113 xar tended to fall less than the broader market and rally harder from 1018 to 1027 candlesticks on xar tended to shrink and the candlesticks for spy tended to grow larger you can literally see in the charts starting on 925 that xar had far more relative strength than spy we know for a fact that netanyahu was given warnings leading into the attack that some kind of event was approaching so here s my theory some intelligence service in the middle east probably saudi egyptian or both heard rumblings of an attack they almost certainly didn t have a day and time let alone specific enough plans to be 100 sure they could thwart the attack all they probably knew was that there was some kind of imminent attack one that could possibly result in more checks written to american defense contractors so they bought the shares x200b or as jesse livermore might say you ll remember that spy went down from 925 through 927 the other day while the defense stocks rallied sharply that was the fact on october 7th hamas launched an attack against israel that was the reason they knew what what could happen and even if they didn t buy the stock themselves they at least didn t sell it there was no inside selling no reason why it should not rally alright crucify me in the comments x200b

is it possible somebody is trying to rip me off about 6 weeks ago i got a text from a girl who had dialed the wrong number for whatever reason i decided to keep talking to this girl she was cool just happens to be cute as well she is from china here on a worker s visa but lives in new york city i m in utah we ve talked about all sorts of things and we send each other pictures and selfies almost every day when we started talking to each other about what we do for a living she had told me she is in to finance and she uses metatrader5 specifically xauud she almost trades exclusively with gold she s tried to help me use it and set me up with a demo account and everything she wants me to screenshot her everything then she tells me what to do i didn t screenshot my password or anything i ve decided to just watch some youtube videos on how to use metatrader she says that her uncle who has lived in san francisco for about 10 years helps her on metatrader like she ll tell me how she gets on the market and her uncle tells her when to trade and stuff like that she seems very willing to teach me how to use metatrader i ve thought of saving up $1000 dollars and seeing what i can do with it she set me up a demo account for 100 000 dollars here s the rub the other night she was talking how she had a bad night she only made 39k in one night so then i m like wait so you re saying whenever you and your uncle get on the market you guys are making 5 figures she tells me how she has made 130k in one night now i m starting to wonder if this girl is trying to scam me somehow i mean it can t be that easy to make that amount of money like that i mean is she involved with insider trading idk i obviously don t know anything about the market and that s why i ve come here to ask you guys cause you ll give it to me straight the reason i came to this sub is because i was interested in the gamestopamc stock that was artificially inflated for a short time i mean i met this girl purely by chance and she didn t getting very willing to help me with trading until we had been talking for a few weeks any way she hasn t asked me to send her money or anything and i know that she isn t sending me pics of someone else because of the nature of the pictures we send each other but i could be wrong on that i m not simping for this girl or anything the reason i found her so fascinating in the first place is because i like learning about other cultures and i just had questions about how it was like growing up in hong kong she is 36 i m 32 but it makes me wonder this has got to be too good to be true right there s no way i stumbled on to someone that can help me build up money like this right if you guys have any other questions don t hesitate to ask i m ignorant on trading and i knew i d get some good answers here i d like to think she genuinely wants to help me make more money but you never know
question about buying calls i see screenshots of high strike prices on stuff like bbby like 60$ isn t the lower the strike price the better isn t your profit based upon how high it is above your strike price so if the new price was 80$ wouldn t you have made more money on your calls of a strike price of like 30$ rather than $60

now that i know what parenthesis mean i think the government might be admitting we are 131 trillion in the hole in the us they wouldn t be underestimating would they read on and let me know what you think at least other governments suckus too i just wanted to try and do a little bit of due diligence in 14 years the fed balance sheet has almost hit a 10 bagger yowza this line looks horrible considering its current trajectory and that each dose of qe has dwarfed the previous dose do you think the fed will successfully shrink this pause while i take a moment to congratulate the fed on its current effort to curb rising prices due to inflation fed congratulations you have raised the fed funds rate to crisis levels well at least what used to be crisis levels great job andthe economy and market can barely even handle rates rising slightly assets total assets total assets less eliminations from consolidation wednesday level walcl fred st louis fed stlouisfedorg at least we don t have to worry about the fed continuing to print money out of thin air they are serious about this inflation thing and are definitely going go stop injecting stimulus into to economy i mean the last time they said that they followed through amirite nope they pivoted right away it was a big fat fail but this time is different the economy is strong as it has ever been the job market has never had more openings or more job creation well if you don t count those pandemic job losses gdp is also awesomeespecially if you remove those imports people can afford energy groceries and shelter easily the infrastructure has never been better and requires hardly any updates we have invested wisely pensions are fully funded healthcare is cheap and easily accessible and the military industrial complex has slowed down and focused its efforts on world peace oh shit i goofed i don t think any of that is true shit old people didn t pillage the social safety nets did they maybe they did there should be more than 3 trillion right damn i think they did x200b source httpsfiscaltreasurygovfilesreportsstatementsfinancialreport2021notestothefinancialstatements25pdf is this why i get those mailers that cost money you know the ones where they tell me i am paying but they will be out of money pretty soon that is a good use of the money they have left i wonder how they are really doing what is the net position of the us government x200b source httpsfiscaltreasurygovreportsstatementsfinancialreportstatementsofoperationschangeshtml hell yes 33 trillion fuck do those parenthesis mean it s negative 33 trillion who flung the poo that is true healthcare isn t that expensive i bet medicare is rocking it $6000 wee whooo bus rides and $400 prescriptions add up i bet the government is getting a good cut of that money the nih is probably making bank on the patents our tax dollars fund i heard recently that they got like $350 million or something they gotta be a hella profit center it has to be i mean some people have both medicare and medicaid double coverage must be a good sign so what s up medicare x200b source httpsfiscaltreasurygovfilesreportsstatementsfinancialreport2021notestothefinancialstatements25pdf hell yes two numbers 482 to 581 trillion dollars fuck is that parenthesis i see are these also negative who flung the poo that is true okay okay i mean the social services umbrella must be doing good overall let s see how the actuaries see it i m gonna be honest i m not even sure what that word means i think it is from actually so yeah they must actually be right x200b source httpsfiscaltreasurygovreportsstatementsfinancialreportstatementsoflongtermfiscalprojectionshtml woooooohoooooo fiscal gap isn t even listed and hell to the fucking yeah 976 trillion bow chica bow wow get the strippers and coke it is time to retire on the government i am squinting a bit because of the being high oh no fuck no those aren t parenthesis i see are they fuuuuuuuuck are these also negative numbers who flung the poo that is true 976334 131 trillion no big deal i mean we have like 261 million ounces of gold right oh that gold is owned by the fed and the fed is not owned by the government but instead private member banks well this story sucks it is no good at all at least the government will do the responsible thing they are definitely going to raise taxes and cut spending they have a strong history of being fiscally responsible right fuck that is a mom from queens who has to balance her budget and can t spend more than is in her account silly me i forgot the government doesn t follow the rules for thee and here i thought the fed would not need to step in and monetize these debts i could be wrong but i think the fed might have to we can guarantee cash benefits as far out and at whatever size you like but we cannot guarantee their purchasing power alan greenspan i guess alan when he was fed chair wasn t lying is there anything good about this the good news is these numbers were like last year it s not like they would get that much worse right the government wouldn t spend more money than they take in we wouldn t give money to ukraine if we didn t have a surplus right also the cplie was like 31 when the actuaries came up with this shit i bet 9 inflation won t make it that much worse i mean substitution weighting and hedonics must be good for us as consumers am i right things are definitely going to cost less in the future dammit none of that is right either can t the fucking house members and senators go behind wendy s and bring in some fucking income okay so the only good news is that this might be providing the opporntunity of a lifetime i know it is not super popular around here but a shiny industrial and monetary metal at around $18 is looking pretty fucking good a few other commodities are sticking out as huge value plays at least to me do your own due diligence i am not your financial advisor this is not financial advice tldr bigger numbers are normally better but not when they are negative i think the government is admitting we are like 131 trillion in the hole i am not an accountant i am not that smart point out any flaws in the comments we might be really fucked here on the positive some commodities seems super cheap

i am down 90 on my $wish position since wsb recommended it a year ago i have decided go buy lots of calls now because i was working at the library and a hot chick came in wearing a wish tshirt if hot chicks are wearing wish clothing you know it s trendy if you know it s trendy by the tiktok generation you know they re generating profit if you know they re generating profit you know the stock might grow if the stock might grow i might make some money on these calls x200b x200b or at least going to be popular which is really what makes a stocks value rise anyway x200b edit let me clarify not a shirt from wish but a wish tshirt like with the company name on it
stripclub stock i ve said it before and i ll say it again rci hospitality rick is the stock to buy right now valued at 7x forward free cash flow their yield would be over 14 meanwhile they re expected to grow their fcf by 30 in 2023 if the stock doesn t rise like its fcf does you re looking at an 18 yielding stock and you can expect them to grow their fcf for years as they only have 50 clubs of the 4000 stripclubs in the usa as they re the only big company buying stripclubs whereas there are many stripclub owners in the age of 50 they can buy these stripclubs for very low prices yielding them 25 to 30 as they re a big company they have scale advantages such as buying their alcohol in bulk which means their actual yield on these purchases is actually higher also due to their professional experience in stripclubs they can manage their clubs better than the previous owners instead of buying companies with hardly any intrinsic value such as bbby hoping another ape buys it off of you for a higher price why don t you invest in a great company which is actually really cheap with a very obvious road to way more profit in the future
rtx calls this time as i have said before i am buyer at 9596 and a seller at 9899the patters for this stonk are so consistent i thought i would make a play the spreed on these options is high the volume is low so dont just hit buy also it can take 15 minutes to buy or sell 200 contracts when i do this i make money on 50 cent moves so if you buy for 20 more you risk it all for hardly anything i am also seriously considering spy puts 5 green days in row seems unlikely that next week will be 10 green days in a row this 25k is 5 month of pay for me as a teacher but it is only 26 of my stonk money so my stomach is not in as much pain the first few yolo s
tsla call options questions i am looking into options and bought 30x 250 tsla calls 914 with an average cost of 018$ only worth 4 50$ i know it is a small position but i wanted to try a few questions can someone explain to me what happens to these options if tsla hits 250$ within the time what happens at 251 252 what would be a good cash out point in your opinion
$bbby options activity explosion stacking kegs of gunpowder tldr $bbby option interest has shown huge activity today at more than 3x volume if there is heavy upward intraweek movement there will likely be an additional upward price explosion i m not a financial advisor none of this is financial advice x200b the huge intraday activity on $bbby has created an extremely dangerous environment for market makers in the options market today s options volume is over 3x the average and sitting at over 400k as of writing this post x200b source market chameleon while the stock price has remained relatively neutral after its intraday pop call option volume is outpacing put option volume at an over 21 ratio and there is especially large volume stacking at the 12 and 14 dollar strike prices x200b aug12 options chain sourced from thinkorswim aug19 options chain sourced from thinkorswim for those of you who are new to this most of the options that are sold intraday are sourced from marketmakers who have a responsibility to provide options at reasonable spread prices this ensures that the option contracts you hold have decent liquidity and allows a market for heavily otm and itm options market makers are agnostic to price movements they normally make money off the spread on options and offset risk using complex calculations that i m not qualified to speak on normally they have their shit very covered however mm s still have an obligation to sell options at decent bidask spreads in order to maintain their mm status which gives them a lot of nice juicy trading advantages which i m also not qualified to talk about essentially you have an algorithmic trading machine which calculates volatility against a stock along with probabilistic price within a time frame sets a price for an option and then sells it while hedging significantly all of these complex models built by rocket scientists normally work very well in ensuring liquidity when things are moving rationally when encountered with sheer stupidity they fail implied volatility on a series of options is low for a while and then all of a sudden a gorilla appears and tears the shit out of everything x200b normally options are priced around expected events and even macro climates but it s difficult to price in a group of people waking up one morning and deciding to pump a pos stock especially while maintaining a low spread and decent volume this could happen to anything certain conditions like short floats help add fuel to the fire but at the end of the day excessive options contracts are the nuclear bomb i probably shouldn t do this but knowing my audience i m going to explain what an options contract specifically a call is a single options contract specifically in this instance a call allows the owner to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the listed stock price since it has the highest intraday volume let s look at the august 12 14 strike calls these options give you the right to buy $bbby at at 14$ a share right now these are essentially almost worthless the stock is trading a little above 11 so you wouldn t want to exercise them in the event that bbby hits 15 they d be worth around 1$ and maybe more if adjusting for volatility and time decay that s awesome but i doubt many of you have the money to exercise options most of the time they get sold back to market makers or other buyers who will pay a you a premium for being soooooooo smart and guessing that the price was higher over expiry however these contracts still represent an obligation to deliver shares of $bbby you might exercise them you might not it doesn t matter what matters is that market makers need enough cash by expiry to pay either the difference between the outstanding stock price and the option or to buy the shares the option represents so they can be delivered to you normally market makers will have a model tell them how much cash they need floating to clear their obligations for a week and roughly how much physical stock they ll need to deliver it s complicated but essentially mm s don t need to cover their exposure 1 to 1 by let s say holding 100 $bbby shares for every contract they sell that is to say normally they don t need to cover 11 mm s can try to cover the volatility of an underlying security by raising the price but if the price action on the security is especially insane there s a point where covering with cash becomes a big liability this is gonna be a bit long bear with me let s have a though experiment on the 14$ strike price options current volume on them is over 29 000 as of writing this as of this morning open interest on them was 0 open interest represents the total number of outstanding options at a specific strike so noone owned any aug 14 calls as of this morning open interest is updated daily so we ll only be able to see fresh open interest at this particular strike tomorrow morning volume is not the greatest indicator it only represents the number of times a specific option at a specific price has changed hands 29k volume basically tells you an option has traded 29 000 times it s not really possible to infer open interest from volume but it does give a very clear indication that there are a lot of transactions where there didn t used to be any for example there could be a volume of 10 000 where the open interest netted at 0 because mm s could issue 5 000 options at a strike and then buy them back same day this isn t generally the case though and this options activity implies there will be significant open interest as of tomorrow morning with that out of the way let s make up a conservative open interest of 5 000 for 14$ strike calls this would imply that there are 5 000 outstanding contracts for mm s to deliver $bbby amounting to an obligation for 500 000 shares representing 07 of the float here s a table outlining rough obligations based off that outstanding interest if the underlying options are sold outright x200b closing pricetotal obligation 14 and below0$ 15500 000$ 203 000 000$ 255 500 000$ 308 000 000$ x200b this is barely a scratch it won t move markets and it won t make the mm s blink still this is an obligation to deliver shares let s look at possible open interest on this strike the contractual delivery obligation and its representation as of float fyi outstanding float is 6844million x200b open interesttotal obligated sharespercentage of float 5 000500 0000730 10 0001 000 0001461 15 0001 500 000219 20 0002 000 000292 x200b normally mm s wouldn t give a shit about the option s contracts actual obligations since there s normally never any individual consumer incentive to exercise average options exercise rate normally hovers at 7 this implies holding just around 50 000 shares with an open interest of 5 000 since this is something that s modeled it s also open to large amounts of exploitation by hedge funds extremely wealthy traders and the like especially during periods of insanity when retards are hitting the fucking gas and pumping the price let s say you re masayoshi son and you have a billion lying around to just fuck around with the mm s with you don t give a shit about price movement or any of that and you ve bought 25k of $bbby options 14 it represents a little over 35 of the float you re out 35 million for a company trading at 11 why would you do that you retard well the mm s don t have 25million shares they expected 7 assignment and all of a sudden they re running to grab shares in a hot market to fill your options well look at that the share price isn t 11 anymore this doesn t really matter to you personally you have a shit ton of these options at different prices you don t even need to exercise them all you can hold bby as a nice pretty reminder because you ve just changed the perspective of the mm s as an mm all of a sudden that 7 exercise number is worth dogshit you ve just gotten railed by an otm exercise and you need a lot more equity to cover this open interest with these monkeys out there now it looks like you re buying does our masayoshi unwind his position now that he s in the money fuck no the rapid move on bbby caused issuance of extremely otm options in expectation for the heavy move upward you ve been sitting on aug 19 $bbby 20 or some shit you won t even exercise it you ll just sell it to the mmm s and they ll say thank you masayoshi son for not forcing us to buy more $bbby this is an example of exposure that market makers face especially when there s insane volume like this there s no guarantee a billionaire will fall out of the sky to save your dumb otm calls the purpose of the example is to illustrate that if large or retail investors change the exercise rate for options under $bbby it ll force mm s to cover to a larger extent and make issuing options which they still have an obligation to do more difficult for them this will start pegging options issuance even otm option issuance more closely to actual stock prices and push $bbby even further up and this risk is further magnified the more insane the runup is for two reasons 1 if bby is running hot going into next week there s an incentive for option holders to take shares instead of cash in an effort to keep profiting 2 market makers will be forced to take up a significant share of the float to limit their exposure to this insanity in summary 1 $bbby is extremely exposed to upward manipulation from larger investors 2 mm s are extremely exposed 3 upward price action is currently only being driven by stock sales but if exercise rates of options increase over time option sales will also start significantly impacting stock price due mm s buying shares to cover option issuance 4 major breakouts above high open interest points ie 1214 strike will magnify this effect x200b risks 1 all of this is happening because y all are in a buying frenzy there s no guarantee you ll make money off $bbby and everyone could wake up tomorrow and dump 2 larger investors could also wake up and dump just to fuck retail 3 mm s could have countermeasures to limit their obligations to physically hold shares 4 i m retarded edit something i forgot to mention is that the way that an mm will hedge an options position is by immediately selling it for a profit on the spread so an mm could be holding options sell them on the ask and then buy them on the bid if their supply of options on either side dwindles they need to start writing them which happens when there s a discrepancy in demand vs supply this creates exposure and widens the spread it is very likely that a large portion of open interest could be other retail traders like you and me or just large funds playing the other side whoever they are similar rules apply edit 2 seems like i m getting some awards for this while appreciated it would be much cooler if you donate to st jude because kids get cancer too

my lotto play for dis s earnings tonight disney is reporting it s fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell i m wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with disney shares up 13 year to date to top the sp 500 s 8 here are what analysts expect earnings per share 93 cents per share expected according to a refinitiv survey of analysts revenue $2179 billion expected according to refinitiv disney total subscriptions 16317 million expected according to streetaccount they re expecting a drop in disney s secondquarter earnings per share compared to the q2 2022 eps but with q2 sales up from the prioryear quarter investors will be hoping that disney can post another betterthanexpected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies notably disney easily surpassed its q1 eps expectations by 43 last quarter the earnings beat was driven by a 21 yoy increase in the parks experiences and products segment revenue at $87 billion this led to shares of dis spiking more than 5 before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks certainly more sustainability in disney s price movement after reporting its q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year s rally can be extended beyond daytoday operations at the company we re going to expect bob iger ceo of disney to address a number ongoing challenges on monday disney expanded its federal lawsuit against florida gov ron desantis accusing the republican leader of doubling down on his retribution campaign against the company by signing legislation to void disney s development deals in orlando additionally the company is already seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike including the production shutdowns of marvel studios blade which was set to begin filming in atlanta next month as well as the disney star wars series andor iger cost cutting in regard to disney increasing its margins iger returned to the helm of the company last november with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability during its last quarterly report and iger s first back as ceo the disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $55 billion to the delight of investors iger stated the costcutting initiatives will make it possible for disney s board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year we expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon streaming growth like streaming competitor netflix nflx disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth with that being said disney s ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its q2 results specifically wall street is eyeing disney after the streaming service lost 24 million subscribers during q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from bigname tech stocks like aapl and amzn this was the firstly quarterly loss since disney was launched in 2019 still a wider loss was expected among disney subscribers last quarter with disney topping estimates by 3 disney had 1618 million paid subscribers during q1 and 2347 million total subscribers when including its espn and hulu services while disney s total paid subscribers topped netflix s 2325 million paying members the company s direct to consumer segment reported a $11 billion loss during q1 up from $05 billion in the prioryear quarter disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at disney and a decrease in results at hulu although there were improved results at espn direct to consumer revenue did increase by 13 yoy during q1 to $53 billion improvement in operating costs among the direct to consumer segment will make disney s stock much more attractive longerterm investors are hoping that disney s growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company earnings expected move looking at the implied volatility of the options market in disney we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is $355 about 35 of the stock s notional value this is not too high of an expected move for an equity but it is about 77 of the expected move through the june options cycle 39 days away from expiration and over 50 of the expected move in the july options expiration cycle based on this information the market is placing a lot of weight on wednesday s earnings report given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to furtherdated cycles with dis stock trading at $10070 at the time of writing this we can go to equidistant outofthemoney otm strikes to see if there is a difference in premium or skewed premium looking into the option chain in this case the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts both 5 points otm from the current stock price this tells us that disney s options market has call skew in the weekly cycle this indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside this does not mean the stock is going to go up but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly what to do for disney earnings i looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings the stock moves on average 4 3 after the earnings report with this said it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that s very very similar to this percentage however given everything i ve looked at i want to get puts dis 512 99p is 203 however i ll be inversing myself because of the wsb cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread i can buy the dis 512 102c for $241 and sell the 105c for $140 this means i can grab the spread for $101 and potentially make 3x gains because why not

be aware nvidia is not the only tensorcore supplier poorly covered in the press yes nvidia is selling a lot of high margin ai product as cloud datacenters scale to handle the demand be aware they are being positioned as the only option they are not and in fact have solutions that do not benchmark at the top also be aware that the network infrastructure for ai to ai interconnect is different than historical dc networking to address this google creator of the modern tensorcore created a new networking paradigm apollo facebook is working on similar and tesla every car is machine learning implemented their own superior tensorcore array called dojo apple is investing deeply into ai and more of the m processor die space will have tensorcores amd and intel of course are in also in play i state this because the hypster press would have you believe nvidia has a lock not at all they did not invent it but are doing a great job of holding their installed base with it the barrier to entry is low pci interfaces memory structures and tensorcores are all pedestrian readily available tech nobody has a monopoly on it no moat several other players are also making purpose built ai clusters that scale well beyond anything nvidia can even do watch for acquisitions cerebras
poor man s covered call what it is why i m doing it with $30k worth of msft calls and why you should consider trying it tldr at top tldr selling covered calls good you can use longterm call options as collateral instead of having to buy 100 shares of the underlying asset this makes you big money at a relatively lower risk than you might expect it s a strategy that consists of buying itm or very close to itm longterm call options and then using that as collateral to sell a short term otm covered call i made this post in response to a lot of the people on my last wsb post turns out not many people seem to know what the pmcc is despite this being a heavily option based sub reddit so i will try to simplify it for those that don t know much about options a call option gives you the option to purchase an equity at the strike price where as a person who owns 100 shares can sell a covered call option and they will sell you those 100 shares for your strike price the premium you pay is what he gets to keep so his goal is to write options that will never be able to be exercised that way he keeps both the premium and his 100 shares he does this by selling short term very otm call options they re great because there are fools that think that buying multiple cheap call options will make them more money than one really expensive in the money longterm option and this is where wsb comes in there are plenty of people in the sub that simply love fds for whatever reason i genuinely believe that some people don t fully understand why people love to sell these to them so let me explain why one is smart and why one is dumb let s say microsoft is currently $400 i bought 100 shares for that price and i m going to sell a covered call that expires in one month at a strike price of 425 let s say that microsoft hit the price of $430 and the person exercised the option in this scenario i would have to sell my 100 shares of microsoft for $425 despite selling for $430 on the market but hey remember you bought them for $400 now you sold them for $425 and you get to keep whatever the person paid for the premium on top of that the risk here is that microsoft could hit something like $470 and you would still have to sell it for $425 and the premium you made is nowhere near enough to compensate the money you could ve gotten if you would ve just held onto it and not sold you as the call option writer can decide to sell a very short term very out the money call option that will likely never be exercised but it will be sold for cheap or you could sell a very close to the money longerterm call option for a massive premium or of course something in between but with that being said 80 of all call options written expire worthless so you do have a bit of a competitive edge on your side now as for the buyer he buys a bunch of short term out the money call options for cheap because he thinks he will make more money this way which is of course possible but it would be very very unlikely unfortunately theta really kicks in the last 12 months so because he chose a short term option he really really needs to fight against the clock here also because the call options he bought are really otm the delta on his options are very low meaning he would need a massive price movement in order to feel anything through his options obviously he is set up for failure and his call options expire worthless which happens 90 of the time and even when it doesn t it doesn t necessarily make up for all the money lost in the past so what have we learned selling covered calls good buying short term out the money options bad but do you have $40 000 to buy 100 shares of microsoft so that you can write call options on it or let s assume that you do you could buy 100 shares or you can buy multiple longterm call options that are itm or close to it and remember each call option represents 100 shares of microsoft and because let s say you bought three you can then sell three short term out the money covered call options if you get assigned you now have to sell 100 shares to the person at whatever the strike is you don t need to actually own 100 shares you just need to have enough money to buy 100 shares and then you will sell them at the strike price but wait the stock price must have gone up in order for the options to able to be exercised but wait you own call options see where this is going most uptodate brokerages let you use call options as collateral to sell covered calls because of this very reason in the scenario where you get assigned you should hopefully have call options that increased in value now you can sell a call option for more than what you bought it for and on top of that you keep the premium however this introduces more risk because depending on your contract length and how near the money your call options that you bought and sold are it is completely possible to have to pay a lot for the assignment and not have options that went up all that much and they can always expire worthless if you do decide to keep holding them also if you think the covered call you sold will be dramatically itm by its expiration date at some point you could just pay to close the position you ll pay whatever premium it s going for but then you won t be using it as collateral any longer much better than being assigned but there are ways to minimize this simply put sell short term out the money options so that whoever buys them has to deal with high theta and low delta meaning time decay will dramatically eat up the intrinsic value of the contract and there would have to be massive price movement to have a positive effect on the option price they bought meanwhile you buy longterm in the money call options as collateral meaning that theta will not eat up much of its intrinsic value and because your delta is very high since it s in the money small movements in the underlying assets will have a bigger impact on your option whether for better or for worse oh and now you re able to sell many more call options because instead of buying 100 shares you bought contracts that represent 100 shares of course like anything it works until it doesn t but even if the underlying asset you write it on end up tanking you at least keep the premium depending on how long the contract is you could hold if you think it might eventually go back up or sell it for significantly less than what you bought it for but at the very least it keeps a lot of its intrinsic value since it s a longterm contract so far everything i ve covered is the pmcc strategy as you would read or hear about it the following is my take and twist on it i am exclusively doing this with microsoft simply because it s microsoft as in it s a very reputable company and it only seems to go up if i have five call options i do not write five covered calls on it because i don t ever want to have to risk liquidating my entire options portfolio even if you make sure the risk is relatively low the risk is still there speaking of i buy the bulk of my options to be expiring one year or more from when i bought it so that it can qualify for longterm capital gains tax remember it s not just about how much money you make it s also about how much money you get to keep and what do i do with the options premiums i collect well i simply save until i get enough to buy another longterm in the money call option which lets me sell more cover call options which can then help me buy more call options which can then help me sell more covered call options you get the idea and lowers the cost basis of the call options i buy if i decide to continue injecting my own cash from my bank account also it gives me a bit of downside protection since i ll be able to keep the premium if things turn for the worst whereas normally if the option you buy doesn t end up working out you just lose everything and remember your longterm in the money call options will retain a good amount of their intrinsic value at least of course the whole idea is that the underlying asset will go up and at least move closer to your strike price overtime this is like buying a regular leap but with extra steps because along the way you have potential to make considerable income because of the premiums you collect if done correctly and all goes well you can exponentially grow your portfolio value really quickly with a lower risk than you would expect anyway this was a bit of a oversimplification i highly recommend you watch a youtube video if you are interested yes i am aware of the other greeks but i didn t want to bring them up because this post is already long and complicated as it is edit i replied to like 50 comments at this point what i m gonna do is just gather up the most commonly commented questions and then answer them in future post so please don t get offended if i don t respond to you here

i ve seen some dog water technical analysis on gamestop s stock so here s my technical analysis and an analysis of uroutinehuckleberry5 s fud and bs firstly here s why uroutinehuckleberry5 s 921 ema is pure bs in his chart uroutinehuckleberry5 shows a basic strategy that every courseselling technical analysis guru uses the most wellknown and useless strategy out there a macd crossover this strategy is dog water for two reasons a macd crossover is a lagging strategy used mainly to determine trends in combination with other indicators instead of having any real predictive value on its own to explain it simply a macd crossover just shows that returns for a shorterterm period have been higher than returns for a longerterm period if anything such an indicator is actually a bad sign from a mean reversion perspective of ta as it could indicate the shortterm profits might be overextended he explained that the two profitable trades shown in the chart are proof that the strategy works and responded to a redditor who called out his bs by saying the following uhmm it crossed down in december as the chart shows and look at the effect it had went from $182 down to $83 to test his amazing strategy of buying on the crossover and selling on the crossunder i spent around 2 minutes to run a simple tradingview backtest backtest results for uroutinehuckleberry5 s strategy the backtest quickly showed that if you followed this 921 ema strategy since the ipo of gme only 26 of your trades would be profitable and ignoring the two successful trades that uroutinehuckleberry5 was using to claim the strategy worked you would have lost over 81 following this strategy since ipo jim cramer level losses now the two trades that he did show in the graph were phenomenal bringing the backtest back up to profitability but they re clearly not representative of the larger sample as shown by the enormous drawdown of 9252 and the terrible profitability of the strategy of course the backtest s results are this bad even while using the incorrect assumption that shorting can be done with 0 interest payments chart 1 backtest results for uroutinehuckleberry5 s mindblowing strategy with that out of the way let us move on to some technical analysis chart 2 weekly candlestick of $gme one glance at $gme s charts should tell anyone that this stock is a bull without a head and can run in a random direction very quickly with this in mind nobody can predict this stock with any degree of certainty unless they are manipulating the price starting with the ta concepts of trends support and resistance it should be clear to anyone that has studied technical analysis that chart 2 shows that $gme is running into an area of resistance around roughly 148 to 151 which was confirmed 3 times by pivot highs and one time with a bearish engulfing gme is also trading below the moving average for the past 300 days both of these are signs it s better to be shorting the stock than to be in the stock right now of course in theory both of these signs can be reversed and broken which is why i added extra indicators to check chart 3 daily candlestick chart of $gme with ma 300 ndo 14 and sqzmom indicators as well as support and resistance levels drawn the two indicators called ndo normal distribution outliers calculate a zscore for volume which helps determine if the volume is statistically significant for a day in this case both the ndo 14 with normal volume and the ndo 14 with short volume for the past week have been fairly insignificant falling within less than 1 times the 14day standard deviation of their average this takes the short squeeze argument away from shills as the short volume is nothing special now and so a short squeeze can t happen it also shows that the recent 1 week s rally doesn t have much strength behind it as few shares traded hands on the other hand using lazybear s squeeze momentum indicator which is pretty good at spotting reversals and momentum in the short term the indicator has turned to green which is generally a good sign for a stock showing some squeeze potential however the size of the green candle is so minor i don t believe that gme will be able to break resistance at the level around 148 to 153 so overall technical analysis of $gme reveals that the stock will most likely not go far above 153 in the short term of course if a whale suddenly jumps in and buys 5 minionillion shares then the price will rise but in my opinion this is less likely than the possibility of $gme s stock going down in value in the short run ps if anything do not buy options right now if you don t know the basics of option greeks according to ivolatilitycom the current implied volatility is around 13122 whereas the 30 historical volatility is 8645 a difference of 4477 percentage points this means u will get fucked by theta for buying options edit apparently cramer was bearish on gme therefore all my calculations r wrong and its hella bullish rn gme edit 2 the combination of cramer bearishness and another redditor posting technical analysis with more lines and colors than me means the price might actually break out rn and moon it s too risky a trade for me but i wish all bulls good luck
thought experiment if you were forced to invest into a stock based on a metric and the stock price was hidden what metric would it be i was thinking to myself if the news channels and investing platforms wouldn t show the stock price but some other fundamental metric then what would you prefer it be if this were to be the case it would x200b 1 help us invest more soundly on a fundamental basis 2 avoid people fomoing into a stock when it has run up and 3 also help us to avoid selling when the stock price has fallen as seeing the fundamental metric instead of the stock price would provide us with a better info or even the calrity to buy the stock as its now available cheaper for eg for amzn pocf is touted as a better measure to keep track of for investing into amzn if below 2022 then it s touted as a good buying opportunity and not a good opportunity if its above that what would your preferred metric be i understand its not possible to have a onesizefitsall metric but as it s a thought experiment we are not limited we can even have multiple metrics but the key is the stock price is hidden
$amzn from zero to everything from zero to everything amazoncom inc amazon went from zero to one everything starting as a simple online bookstore in the 1990s every piece of the puzzle seemed to fall into place over the years to create the $1 trillion leader in ecommerce cloud and ecommerce channel advertising we know today the everything store amazon is a company like no other it was a technology company when nobody saw it believed it or even thought it on the surface it was just an online bookstore deep down it knew its opportunities were endless it pioneered cloud computing with aws created the greatest online shopping experience based on price selection and convenience and designed the marketleading kindle ebook readers today amazon sees no limits it operates in streaming advertising cloud computing ecommerce physical stores consumer goods publishing and more where are we now it is still day one at amazon today growth in prime users is strong and samedayoneday delivery may soon be a reality for many products in most cities amazon has also been making strides in areas outside of ecommerce cloud services gaming entertainment and advertising among others amazon has been investing heavily at the expense of its free cash flow management indicated 40 of capital expenditures are feeding infrastructure mostly the fastgrowing aws 30 is fulfillment capacity and the balance is mainly transportation capacity amazon is still feeling some margin pressure mainly due to the retail segments across the globe however north america s operating loss was only $627 million compared to the $16 billion operating loss recorded in q1 2021 andy jassy ceo of amazon noted in the q2 2022 press release that amazon is making progress on reducing finding efficiencies in the controllable cost base excluding obvious impacts of inflation amazon noted it has improved the productivity of its fulfillment network and will continue to do so while the company still did not record positive free cash flow it seems there is a path forward to get back on track within the next several years aws recorded another quarter of strong growth in q2 2022 33 yearoveryear excluding the impacts of currencies in 2021 aws saw some acceleration in growth as organizations were pulling forward some cloud it spend to modernize their operations at first glance aws growth rates appear to have decelerated but we believe the strong growth rate is intact aws also posted slightly stronger operating margins vs q2 2021 at 290 vs 283 on a ttm basis aws operating margin was 311 amazon s online stores segment reported yearoveryear revenue growth of 0 in q2 2022 coming out of the pandemic in q2 2020 and q2 2021 online stores saw yearoveryear revenue growth rates of 49 and 13 respectively we believe the direlooking growth in this quarter is simply the unwinding of the covid benefit to a normalized growth rate going forward it is possible the results may look and feel much better next year when amazon laps its 2022 results investment thesis amazon was is and will always be a company that puts the customer first by dialing in on fostering exceptional customer experiences and value the company kickstarted a neverending virtuous cycle that started from the very first customer and continues to benefit every customer to this very day 1 amazon is a global technology conglomerate that generates revenues from six major areas online stores aws thirdparty selling services 3pss subscriptions physical stores and other mainly advertising the company has over 200 million prime subscribers almost 500 million square feet of real estate to drive its operations and it is hungry for more 2 amazon has one of the widest moats across its main offerings ecommerce cloud computing and advertising the virtuous cycle that begins and ends with the customer is the source of high switching costs powerful network effects cost advantages high barriers to entry and a reputable brand name 3 amazon faces potential risks with jeff bezos stepping down as ceo antitrust concerns posing a perpetual threat microsoft azure gaining ground in the cloud market margin pressure from growth investments and competition from incumbents across many saturated markets 4 secular industry tailwinds and competitive advantages in ecommerce cloud computing and advertising will buoy amazon s financial and competitive position throughout this decade at a minimum 5 growth and reinvestment opportunities are vast laying the groundwork for a long growth runway key company metrics these are the metrics i keep updated to monitor the investment thesis x200b net sales by segment q1 2022 x200b aws annualized run rate revenue x200b margin metrics x200b total square footage x200b estimated prime members competitive advantages one of the most profound concepts fostered by amazon is the idea of a virtuous cycle focused on the customer at amazon every move begins and ends with the customer in mind the result is exceptional customer experience which leads to more traffic and product reviews attracting more sellers thus contributing to a greater selection across all product categories the result improved customer experience which kicks off the virtuous cycle all over again the virtuous cycle inherently explains the impact of a network effect by uniquely focusing mainly on the customer sellers experience more interest and sales in their products as customers return to amazoncom for their shopping as the customer base grows so do sellers and their product selection and vice versa aws is the most widely known and used cloud platform in the world and amazon s advertising segment is gaining ground at a rapid pace aws and both sponsored and nonsponsored advertising benefit from network effects the former benefits from a vast user base of some of the largest enterprises in the world increasing the likelihood that other organizations searching for a cloud platform will choose aws additionally aws improves as more users initiate usage of the platform collecting data from many customers to create a more effective suite of cloud services and innovate in and around the aws ecosystem to provide an evergrowing number of services to meet organizational needs currently aws offers over 200 fully featured services across the ecosystem the most depth and breadth of services out of any of the major three cloud providers ie aws azure gcp the latter benefits from network effects in two distinct ways companies using sponsored advertising benefit from the large and growing amazon customer base to drive sales and those on nonsponsored advertising solutions benefit from a combination of datadriven programmatic advertising and popular amazon media platforms which are flush with users stemming from the aforementioned network effects are cost advantages high barriers to entry and the benefit of a global and highly reputable brand name in other words these moat characteristics are all interconnected amazon wins because it can offer products at a lower price than almost any company in the world which gives it its scale a deterrent of competition in and of itself according to evercore over 80 of amazon customers in their survey are either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with amazon alluding to the fact that the company puts the customer first this is an unattainable feat for virtually any company in the universe we believe these factors contribute to the reputable brand name of amazon which in turn helps drive adoption of other services like aws and advertising although it may seem that products and services sold on amazoncom have low switching costs given the plethora of other ecommerce websites and streaming services available to consumers we believe consumers face high switching costs when considering the power of the selectionpriceconvenience trifecta for the roughly 200 million prime customers around the world there is virtually no viable alternative that offers the variety of products for the low prices and free express shipping on millions of items at a cost of around $100 per year prime customers break even rather quickly considering the amount of shopping they do on the platform according to evercore research prime customers spend 2 3 times more money per month and shop twice as frequently as nonprime customers additionally more than 75 of prime customers purchase products 2 3 times per month on amazon we believe this consumer behavior and the extremely attractive price point of a prime membership for the value it offers ie free oneday and twoday shipping prime video unlimited music streaming and amazon prime reading brings to light the strength of the trifecta and how unattractive singlestore directtoconsumer alternatives appear to be in comparison regarding price selection and convenience why shop anywhere else when you ve got amazon carrying most if not all of your favorite products aws and amazon advertising should not be left out of the switching costs conversation aws customers may be reluctant to leave due to tangible and intangible costs as they relate to the following decision factors 1 aws provides the most services out of any cloud provider making it rather unlikely that there is much benefit in a customer switching cloud providers 2 cloud functionality may be similar but not quite the same between providers it may cost lots of time and money to recalibrate processes databases and functionalities between cloud providers 3 cloud operations are massive it is unlikely internal organizational teams will be able to learn another cloud platform and its uses quickly enough to avoid business and operational interruptions amazon advertising customers looking to leave the platform would also face enormous direct and indirect costs for one sponsored ads are hosted on the largest ecommerce website on the planet what better place to advertise your product than a website where hundreds of millions of visitors are already shopping for products further amazon s nonsponsored advertising and demandside platform dsp programmatic advertising could provide a more compelling offering than other dsps such as the trade desk given amazon s reach across proprietary sites and apps on top of thirdparty exchanges where many dsps solely operate advertisers on amazon leverage the unimaginable power of amazon consumer data to place effective and relevant ads across many platforms we believe most advertisers would face internal backlash and reluctance towards cutting off amazon s advertising services x200b market shares opportunities ahead amazon is the bestpositioned ecommerce platform in our view the company keeps swallowing up distribution and fulfillment center space around the world the company has a massive footprint and not many other retailers will be able to compete in fact we think amazon will continue to reign as king in the market it created a bulletproof moat in the company also has a massive lead in market share over 40 of total ecommerce sales are fulfilled through amazon in stark contrast walmart amazon s main ecommerce competitor holds less than 10 of the market we believe this displays amazon s role in the market as the consumer s top pick for online shopping advertising services is the fastestgrowing segment at amazon roughly 90 of amazon s ad revenues are derived from ecommerce channel advertising a niche amazon had carved out for itself using its own ecommerce platform we believe ecommerce is a strong secular trend and advertisers will find value in placing ads on amazon as advertisers look away from traditional media ie print magazines tv etc to areas where more eyeballs can be captured amazon is one such place as ecommerce penetration increases jpmorgan estimates that only 15 of workloads around the world are in the cloud a far reach from where it can and should be there are many advantages to shifting from onpremises locations onto the cloud lower it costs almost infinite computing power faster deployment implementation and scalability in a decade when 5g the internet of things edge computing and growing data consumption will change how the world looks today it should come with no surprise that outsourced cloud adoption is expected to accelerate exponentially aws benefits from firstmover advantage and the breadth and depth of its 200 services provided on the platform it controls almost 60 of the infrastructureasaservice iaas and platformasaservice paas combined market ahead of microsoft azure and google cloud platform at 34 and 8 market share respectively although microsoft leverages its reputation among the corporate community to provide organizations with a full and convenient iaas paas and softwareasaservice saas suite of services to capture 50 of the overall cloud market share amazon leads where it matters most iaas and paas which will both experience growth of over 25 through 2024 while saas grows at about half the cagr we believe aws will maintain its lead and continue to capture a significant portion of the growing tam for the following reasons 1 aws has significantly more services features within those services and the deepest functionality within those services than any other cloud provider 2 aws has the strongest reputation and largest network of users among the top three cloud providers the aws partner network apn is robust and fosters a community of partners that build awsderived solutions for sale through the platform more than 90 of fortune 100 companies and most of the fortune 500 companies use the apn 3 aws has the longest track record of operational expertise as the longest serving cloud provider while consistently growing and maintaining the firstplace spot in the iaas paas market 4 aws has the largest network of global cloud infrastructure playing into the technological trends which can only be enabled with low latency and massive computing power amazon s prime membership is quite frankly one of the best consumer value propositions out there today the service varies in pricing by country using the us amazon prime membership as a proxy the membership only costs $139 per year or $1499 per month considering all these benefits anyone interested in a prime membership for any purpose is likely to find high value in many of the other perks for example someone who would like a prime video membership can pay a few dollars more each month to gain access to everything else on the delivery side the payback period for a year s worth of prime is extremely short depending how much one values their time it could pay off within a few orders at most it will pay off after about 14 orders in a year assuming oneday delivery costs $10 per order on average it s easy to rack up more than 14 orders per year in fact the average prime member orders 24 times each year and for an average total of $1 400 think about it everyday items like shampoo or deodorant and gifts gadgets and accessories nonperishable food items grocery and prescription drugs overthecounter drugs and health goods and plenty more are purchased many times throughout the year the average prime member actually saves money and our most value asset time and gets everything else prime video music reading photo storage etc for free amazon is pulling the optionality levers available to the company amazon recently closed on its $85billion acquisition of mgm which opens up a catalogue of over 4 000 movies and 17 000 shows including james bond and the rocky franchises more important than the existing catalogue is the intellectual property at mgm that will help amazon beef up its content on prime video outside of prime video amazon is dabbling with luxury stores physical pharmacy amazon go and plenty of other things we do not yet know about over the next 5 10 years risks amazon established a wide moat across several markets but its moat does not protect it from all forces internal or exogenous we believe the factors presented below represent some of the greatest risk to amazon s financial operational or competitive positions across all time frames amazon operates across many saturated markets and faces competition from wellestablished incumbents in each area ex streaming disney and netflix physical stores costco and walmart 3pss etsy ebay lack of focus poor strategic moves and dilutive mergers or acquisitions in any of its segments may result in lost market share and in more severe cases a full exit from the segment aws competes mainly against microsoft azure a cloud provider that has been growing faster than aws and controls the overall cloud market due to its wellknown business solutions and integrated iaaspaassaas platform aws s lack of a complete suite of saas services consumer industry reluctance of aws adoption due to competition concerns and microsoft s strong corporate relationships could result in microsoft taking over aws s controlling position in the iaas paas market amazon s sheer size raises constant antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world the timing severity and outcome of these investigations are deeply uncertain and could result in amazon being broken up into several smaller companies and depressed valuations if shareholders see fewer opportunities for growth in the future if this were to occur andy jassy has taken over jeff bezos as ceo presenting potential risks to the future of the company if the strategic course of the were to diverge dramatically from bezos s mission amazon is still in growth mode margin pressure will remain a risk in the short and longterm for those that ask all charts are from stratosphereio they have more but i opted to only include the ones relevant to my dd tldr i like the stock edit updated for todays earnings will update charts asap
what is investing investing is an incredible system of research due diligence confidence and timing and in the end if you do it right youll have lost large sums of money

generation moonshot why young investors are not ready to give up on risk financial times even amid a meltdown in crypt0 markets diy traders who came of age after the financial crisis no longer want to play by the old rules x200b with $1 000 in savings and two us government stimulus checks chris zettler began investing in 2020 first he bought companies he knew he says but then i got bored with it he moved on to call options in companies with volatile shareprices riding the price swings he used a win to buy 100 shares in the meme stock amc at $30 in may and sold at about $65 in june x200b the 35yearold finance major at the university of alabama birmingham had a td ameritrade account that allowed him to trade on margin borrowing money from the brokerage to amplify potential returns and place nearly $8 000 in bets with his original $4 000 of capital he turned that into $18 000 x200b zettler saw his account balance rise to $50 000 before falling to $35 000 when a bet went sideways he sold $20 000 of shares and paid his college tuition fees i got lucky as heck zettler says x200b yet the risk was worth it he adds the possibility of making outsized returns outweighed the risk of loss if i did it again would i have done it the responsible way and just sat on that $4 000 shoot noyou don t have anything to lose so you might as well shoot your shot x200b zettler is part of a generation of investors who came of age around the 2008 financial crisis and in its aftermath having struggled to accumulate wealth through traditional means over the past decade many have turned to speculating in the riskier corners of financial markets x200b experts say the growing appetite for speculative assets such as crypt0currencies nfts and meme stocks whose value skyrocketed in early 2021 driven by retail traders and social media hype is about more than just getting rich quick x200b stagnant wages rock bottom interest rates soaring house prices and now corrosive inflation have cut away at the idea that the under40s can follow the welltrodden path to financial security that their parents took younger investors report feeling like the game is rigged and that playing by the old rules is a losing strategy x200b in recent months a combination of inflation and rising interest rates have shaken the crypt0 markets crashing coin prices and the highprofile bankruptcies of crypt0 lenders and hedge funds have exposed the dangerous practices that flourished in the riskiest areas of the market the question now is whether the younger diy investors will retreat x200b zettler s experience suggests not he has watched his peers chase desperate bets on crypt0currencies and volatile stocks hoping to ride the next wave to riches a lot of people view it like they can t afford not to he says i think they re running out of hope x200b fear uncertainty and doubt natasha schll a cultural anthropologist at new york university blames the increased appetite for risk on a widespread disillusionment with the notion that economic success is accessible to anyone who works hard enough part of the appeal of crypt0currencies and memestock runs is that they are antiestablishment designed to operate outside the rules of the traditional financial system x200b the idea that the mainstream economy is trustworthy more so than these other assets is kind of dubious in recent experience she says there has been more and more willingness to say fuck it x200b the appetite for highrisk speculation is particularly sharp among americans who tend to have high levels of personal debt researchers say the average us student now graduates with $37 000 in student debt up from $17 000 in 2001 x200b the idea is that you re supposed to be able to save money for college but almost no middleclass family can in a significant way says caitlin zaloom a professor of social and cultural analysis at nyu there isn t enough financial stability at the core of people s lives if there was there would be little incentive to speculate x200b rent rises have outpaced income growth in most us states since 2001 according to estimates by the center on budget and policy priorities and inflation has pushed the cost of living higher in recent months as low interest rates and heavy debt became a fact of life relationships with risk changed experts say young investors are less likely to approach speculative financial products as investments with underlying value rather they are inclined to treat them like lottery tickets probably worthless but still worth the gamble on a lifechanging payout x200b if you had lottery tickets for houses investors would buy some of those too says jeremy grantham cofounder of the bostonbased asset management group gmo there is enormous inequality and when people get fed upthey start to behave in strange and new ways x200b the logic is simple says ben johnson head of exchange traded fund research at data provider morningstar negative real yields no thank you what are the alternatives jpegs of monkeys and fake internet money it s not surprising that investors feel like they re stuck between nft pet rocksopens a new window and a hard place x200b the discontent isn t limited to the us a majority of british 35yearolds surveyed by the insurance company urban jungle reported feeling at an unfair disadvantage to the generations directly before them when it comes to financial stability and savings x200b gary stevenson a 35yearold former trader and financial education campaigner from east london is one my dad never went to university he worked at the post office for 35 years and could raise three kids and pay off a mortgagehe has a comfortable retirement he says that is off the table for most young people now it s created a bit of a panic x200b if you can t do what your dad or grandad didyou have to come up with a better plan he adds at some point risky bets starts to look like the rational choice one way you see a zero per cent chance of success but if you take on insane riskat least you have a chance x200b to the moon during the meme stock frenzy of early 2021 stories of huge returns fuelled a rush of new trading some people won big an investor who bought gamestop in late december 2020 could have turned 10 000 into 168 744 in a single month when the meme stock hit its peak on january 29 2021 an almost 1 600 per cent gain but there was also the potential for huge losses an investor who bought at the top and then sold in late february would have shrunk the same 10 000 into 3 129 in a month following a 69 per cent plunge according to boring money analysis x200b even so many young investors reject the dumb money label applied to their trades they say the odds are worth the punt given the alternatives many investors remember the unequal recovery from the 2008 crisis when government bailouts followed by a decadelong bull run in markets left the uninvested behind when markets tumbled as covid19 hit in march 2020 they didn t want to miss out a second time new technology meant there was never an easier time to get involved x200b the introduction of commissionfree trading in stocks in the runup to the pandemic added momentum to lotterylike investing behaviour in 2015 the zerocommission brokerage robinhood was launched promising to democratise financial markets four years later almost every usbased broker had eliminated commissions for equity trading robinhood s gamelike app allowed customers to sign up and start trading stocks on their phones within minutes x200b slick crypt0currency exchanges such as coinbase emerged as the number of digital coins on the market exploded a meme coin craze driven by superinfluencers such as elon musk introduced an avalanche of outlandish offerings from those named after celebrities coinye west to the dog coins shiba inu and dog3coin in april 2013 there were just seven crypt0currencies available for mining and trading today there are tens of thousands x200b getting involved was simple it s five buttons on the website says luke hawley a 21yearold going into his senior year at endicott college in massachusetts who studies finance it s easier to buy shiba inu on coinbase than buy an index x200b hawley says it has become normal on his college campus to talk about betting and speculating people think ok i ve got a couple thousand in the bank in the real world that s like broke he says there s a lot of fomo he adds about the idea of passing over a chance to turn a small stake into big money x200b young men in particular have been attracted to this kind of moonshot investing the vast majority of crypt0currency investors are men and more than 90 per cent of trades in gamestop and amc were made by men during the peak of the meme stock frenzy according to the uk brokerage interactive investor experts say one reason these investments are treated like casual bets is because the brokerage apps feel like gambling platforms only without the regulatory guardrails x200b increasingly platforms are blurring the line between gaming gambling and investing especially platforms that enable the use of crypt0currency says jack symons chief executive of the uk app gamban which allows users to block gambling apps on their phones and computers gamban began to block brokerage and crypt0 platforms last summer some might say this is a blunt approach but gambling doesn t look like it used to it s not something that only happens in a casino on green felt symons said in october x200b late last year the largest american gambling hotline told the financial times it was seeing a marked increase in the number of calls coming from people addicted to day trading rather than traditional gambling or sports betting one reason might be that as stevenson explains investing does not carry the same social stigma as gambling x200b if you said my dad spends all day gambling i d say oh man i m so sorry for your family he says but if someone says my dad spends all day fx trading you think he s the wolf of wall streetit s not gambling it s investing and investing is how you get rich x200b diamond hands in recent months as the air has rushed out of the crypt0currency balloon the most speculative parts of the market have been hardest hit but as prices crashed attempts by some crypt0 companies to persuade investors to keep faith and hold on through what they dismissed as just another cyclical crypt0 winter shows the growing power of online communities x200b the under25s are twice as likely to turn to social media for financial advice than any other age group and more than three times as likely to do so than to seek help from a professional according to a survey by uk advisory openmoney x200b robinhood s rise happened as online communities on twitter and reddit began to play a bigger role in investing reddit subforums such as rwallstreetbets provided specialist information for wouldbe investors facilitated their discussions and plucked at their heartstrings x200b big losses could be laughed off with peers and big gains shared and celebrated those who held their nerve were lauded for their hubris diamond hands became the emojivernacular for holding tight to a bold position even when it collapses x200b a study by academics at the university of sydney last year found that people aged between 18 and 24 were much more likely to make risky decisions when they thought their peers were watching agnieszka tymua the lead researcher on the study says online communities of investors amplify the same behaviour people want to take risks to get that big win and post about it x200b the illusion of control also amplifies risk taking whether by laying out the specifics of niche crypt0currencies or discussing moonshot strategies web forums encourage members to feel that the odds of winning are significantly greater than they actually are regulation has not kept up with the spread of misinformation x200b some college students say they are increasingly familiar with the dangers of crypt0currency pump and dump schemes such as socalled rugpulls when a developer launches a crypt0asset drives the price up via social media influencers and then disappears with their gains before the price collapses x200b it s not pretty being on the back end of a rugpull says harrison turner a 19yearold rising college junior from montgomery alabama still he says he understands the influencer s motivation he saw an opportunity and he took it x200b get rich slow despite the increasingly hostile investing environment highrisk speculation may be here to stay it worked spectacularly well for some people and old habits die hard says steve sosnick chief strategist at us trading platform interactive brokers they re still using margin to speculate even as rates go up x200b in may the amount of money borrowed to trade on margin was 25 per cent above prepandemic levels data from finra shows x200b traditional wealth managers are uneasy about the prospect of digital assets going mainstream nearly half of fund selectors say they feel pressure to offer crypt0currencies to attract younger investors according to research by natixis yet 70 per cent say they think individuals should not have exposure to the volatile asset x200b crypt0currency is not the systemic solution to income inequality says georgia lee hussey a wealth manager and founder of modernist financial if your investing strategy is sexy you re doing it wrong x200b brokerages are also worried that investors burnt by big losses could retreat from markets entirely reinforced in their view that the game is rigged attempts to educate potential clients means reaching investors where they are on social platforms fidelity has embraced both digital assets and social media outreach in an effort to connect with investors and convince them it is possible to get rich slow x200b young investors report that their top concern is their financial security how to have enough to be ok says kelly lannan head of emerging customers at fidelity it s very basicwe hear that more with this generation x200b while zettler says he has become more boring with his investments others like turner are still comfortable risking it all he has already lost his brokerage funds once by mistiming a memestock bet but says he can always earn enough to put a few thousand dollars in a brokerage account the money will come and go he says he knows he could lose it all x200b then again he says he could get lucky

the speech this wednesday goes like this ladies and gentlemen based on our policies and tools we have successfully achieved our inflation goals recent data metrics we monitor show that inflation was down to 2 however when we turned the money printer back on there was a technical glitch in the system caused by chat gpt this resulted in trillions of dollars being created outside of our target models after further investigation the bot intended to double the money supply we reacted quickly and swiftly to shut this down as all debts would have been repaid as well and that was not the goal of our targets or policies further we had to pause bank activity or everyone would have received millions instantly this would have caused a financial panic in order to return the excess funds back to the fed we erroneously debited the accounts creating more since this occurred before banks started to fail we avoided a collapse and saved the economy inflation is around 400 so we are raising rates 1 000 000 basis points

energy is the only investment that matters in the next couple of years stop pissing away money on dailyweekly options when you can make huge nearly guaranteed gains on oil companies if you can wait 6 to 12 months fuck it buy options but buy 12 month options instead of short dated ones so the invest thesis can play out we are in the early stages of a global energy crisis esg advocates have dissuaded oil gas and coal companies from investing in capital expenditures over the past 5 or 6 years we are reaching the point that we simply do not have enough energy to power the world at an affordable rate so energy will become unaffordable oil gas and coal companies will make so much money over the next couple years until voters realize how unbelievably stupid the esg policies are and that they have decimated the standard of living in america oil price has been decreasing lately but this has been because of the actions of governments that are attempting to lower the cost of energy over the next couple of months the oil demand will increase by 1 to 2 million barrels per day at the same time that the supply will decrease by 3 to 4 million barrels per day creating a net impact of 4 to 6 million barrels per day of tighter oil markets this will probably result in the price of oil increasing to $150 to $200 over the next year despite a recession china and the us are both releasing approximately 1 million barrels per day from their spr us will likely stop releasing spr oil after the election in november once china ends their zero covid policy of locking down cities with covid outbreaks chinese demand for oil will increase 1 to 2 million barrels per day this winter russian supply of oil will decrease by 1 to 2 million barrels per day because russia is not able to produce oil in siberia during the winter without western oilfield service companies these companies all pulled out of russia due to the war in ukraine only 18 of energy is used as electricity most of which is generated with fossil fuels and the other 82 is fossil fuels directly combusted for energy so the vast majority of energy used is fossil fuels the esg crowd has convinced the world to stop investing in capex for fossil fuel companies because of the switch to wind and solar there is no way to transition to wind and solar fast enough to avoid a massive energy crisis fossil fuels are required to mine the metals required to build the evs wind and solar it will take way way way longer to make the transition compared to what the esg crowd thinks there is massive profit to be made from investing in these hated oil coal and nat gas companies many of them have pe ratios that are 5 or lower at current prices if oil price goes higher then they will only get better some of you might think that soon there will be peace in russia and ukraine and all of these energy issues will go away the west recently destroyed russia s two nord stream pipeline and destroyed their bridge to crimea russia is furious and just started a new offensive against 20 ukrainian cities this war isn t ending any time soon in the short run 6 to 18 months the best investment is oil nat gas and coal companies in the longer term uranium miners will be the best investment i won t go into the details on uranium and nuclear power investment thesis in this thread but longer term it will be a tremendous investment perhaps i will do a follow up post on that thesis
number 1 tip of trading stocks options do not use margin throughout the years of surfing wallstreetbets some of the worst loss porn i ve ever seen has to be people on margin accounts basically where traders get at least 2x of the money they deposited loaned to them which theoretically can work out if your correct but more often than not if a trade goes against you more so in options then you end up owing the brokerage money on top of the money you already lost from your initial deposit also known as a deficit but i do have a few tips so you don t screw yourself over if you can t or don t want to switch from a margin account then have some selfdiscipline by only using the balance you deposited made money on if your using robinhood then you can disable margin account menu investing disable margin investing note by disabling margin you still have access to features such as instant bank deposits instant settlement if on any other brokerage then i recommend switching to a cash account personally i ve been trading the markets for 5 years and never once ran into this issue because very early on i was taught to only risk money i can afford to lose
eili5 why is the fed focusing on dropping wages and employment numbers to reign in inflation even though wages don t even come close to matching inflation why is the fed taking a brain dead keynesian approach and focusing on demand side instead of supply side when the supply side is the entire problem supply chain shortages are what has sent the prices into the stratosphere so how is obliterating the middle class a remotely tenable long term economic strategy am i missing something why is the fed literally waging war on the middle class because the geniuses in the white house and the fed combined burned out the motor on the money printer wtf

buy sqqq calls it seems like nasdaq is going to have a pull back mondaytuesday as there was general weakness in the market last week and the nasdaq mainly went up because of mega techwhich beat expectations however those expectations were largely pretty low in the first place and it was expected that they were to be beaten moreover tech right now seems to be overvalued esp nvidia importantly however three important momentum in dictators all have bearish divergences kst the slowest moving of the three has a single bearish divergence the medium speed macd has a double divergence as does the faster moving rsi moreover the next fomc is 0503 with expectations largely being that the fed will raise interest rates again i think we could see some pull back monday morning i recommend buying sqqq calls with a strike price of 315 and an expiration date of 0505 plan to dump these calls wednesday morning what are y alls thoughts
short term bullish on $shop just took a position in shopify200 shares 3394 then sold 2 calls22 july 22 36 strike for 280$ of premium the goal is to get exercised at 692$ of profit here s my logic there has been a huge sell off of shop for the last 6 months and for 1 month is has been going steady between 30 and 40 a share during this sideways time period it has seen massive amount of volume most likely from short sellers taking profit essentially it s bottoming out i m not expecting a huge out break but i am expecting a lot of investors to come in and buy it expecting it to be bottomed out a lot of institutions are lowering there price expectation on the stock as well which means that they want retail investors to sell so the institutions can close there short positions true bottom out best case scenario we get a big out break and my profit is secured most likely scenario we get a little bull run and my profit is secured not the best but also likely it swings back to resistance at 40 and my profit is secured likely but not good it goes sideways and i liquidate at a small profit or small loss worst case scenario it breaks down and i have to sell covered calls for the next 4 years

62722 spy daily ta another monday that woulda been better spent sleeping in we had a $392 range total today which is only 42 of the 10 day average todays a tough day to say where we are going the rest of the week that 3886 level held as hella strong support all day today with a few massive wicks below it but any time those wicks looked remotely bullish we got a huge spike in volume to close the candle over that key level bulls and bears could both have a fairly large argument that they were right but the more i study this chart and thing about today and the vix i feel the bulls are the winners today and this week or at least tomorrow looking at the daily we got a lot going on blue arrows one could say today is a hanging man candle however a true hanging man reversal is supposed to be 2x longer wick then body thanks to trav11s for pointing this out if you look at the first arrow from may 17th you see the true hanging man causes a massive drop the next day however if you look at the one from june 23rd granted this candle was fighting between a hanging man and dragonfly bullish doji candle we actually saw a massive gap up the next day gaps we currently have two gaps below us now 38137 to 37883 and 37018 to 36938 and we have one gap left above 40144 to 39578 the gap above is the biggest and longest over due dotted blue bull channel we now have a potential blue dotted bull channel forming that uses june 17th and june 23rd to form support and a projected resistance using the june 13th candle this channel actually gives us a ton of upside and gives us plenty of room to see that 402 gap fill black dotted bear channel we have a projected bear channel using june 13th june 15th june 24th and june 27th today as resistance we then projected support off june 17th this channel would prevent a upward gap fill and would favor both lower gaps filling by eod rising wedge bearish using the black dotted resistance line and the blue dotted support line we actually are seeing a rising wedge this can be considered an exhaustion trend and could signal a top is in however the one issue with rising wedges and falling wedges for that matter is with enough volume you can break through this and turn then into a channel instead of a wedge or the wedge can be extended today we broke below the daily 20ema of 3886 numerous times and i believe that s why that support held so well plus it was a bigger support from earlier in may we closed essentially on the 20ema daily ema today now the vix is still continuing to fall and we have yet to reach key support range of 25 but we are getting close the one thing im seeing and its highlighted by these big blue arrows is that we are getting some fairly large spikes on the vix that are all falling right around this resistance line and once those spikes hit we seem to be unwinding the vix the rest of the day today again eod we saw volume and spy in a bearish momentum trend while we actually saw vix dropping they were all pretty disconnected again last week looking at the big red lines on the vix we actually are seeing a similar falling wedge that appears to perfectly inverse the rising wedge on spy now again if vix falls hard enough it will go right through this support line and this support line is not nearly as strong as the resistance line by tomorrow and maybe even by open tomorrow we will see whether the vix is going to break the falling wedge or not where am i at whats my bias well i actually was fairly bearish last week and we didn t drop and by eow i was then bullish i this morning was feeling bearish for the week but with the 3886 support holding so strong and today being hella low volume and vix still unwinding i am actually feeling bullish i think that spy wednesday we will see spy fill the 40155 gap on the daily it could do it tomorrow with a 33 green day though but i al looking for a 40155 gap fill and potentially see bigger bear channel the one dating back to january resistance test if we were to gap fill on wednesday we actually would see a perfect gap fill and channel resistance rejection at 402 that is my anticipation for this week i think once the gap fills though we will most likely be bearish though but best case bulls could break this out to 410 range this is something i used to do a long time ago but i honestly stopped finding predictive value in it cause it was so close to spy someone suggested with the inconsistency of spy right now that it could be a good time to revisit on es spy futures ta well lets take a look at the daily on es and see what we got overall the rising wedge i had mentioned on spy actually is invalidated by the es chart so if you look at the black dotted line using june 15th and june 24th and resistance points today we actually wicked through that line which means its invalidated so we shouldn t see that spy rising wedge play out however we could re draw the black line using todays top and see it play out later this week there is a light blue bull channel using the support line from june 21 22 23 and 24th that seems pretty strong we did not touch that line today but there is a case to be made that if todays june 28th candle was to drop we might see it touch that point which shows support at 3870 now the daily candle for yesterday on es actually is a gravestone doji which usually when seen at the top of a bullish run can signal a reversal bull case for es we will look to ride the daily 20ema support at 38965 overnight and look to test the new rising wedge resistance line at 3965 bulls want to see a clean break through 3965 and eventually will look to retake that 4020 level this 4020 level is an approximation of the 40155 gap fill that i spoke of earlier bear case for es tonight bears will look to break under the daily 20ema of 3896 and tomorrow break through the daily 8ema of 3854 once 3854 is broken the blue dotted support line from this rally will be broken once that is broken bears will look to break down 3761 support next overall looking at the es chart i don t feel that my bias for tomorrow has really changed at all i am slightly concerned by the gravestone doji candle from yesterday but its not always a given 10 challenge today not a great day i entered a 0dte put this morning when we broke through 3886 the first time with a 15min candle we had tons of momentum and vix was in our favor however we then saw two full candles with ridiculous wicks to the upside on them i was looking for a fakeout recovery then further drill that never came tough loss there end of day i entered another 0dte put that eventually saw 50 green only to go to 80 green and then was able to thankfully close it back out for 0 on a quick wick i fully misplayed that and shoulda taken profits i had a 100 take profit order set and once again we had all the signs aligning we were going to see a breakdown closer to 386 eod but it never came hindsight i shoulda taken the 50 gains to recover 50 of that morning put loss live and learn and die but greed i was not going to play any positions over night and honestly i probably shouldn t have played anything overnight but here i am in a 394c 2dte when i started to dig into my ta and that 388 support more i felt that was bullish and not bearish i entered these uvxy 145c this morning when it looked like we were breaking out they never really saw green as it almost immediately dropped i am using these as a hedge for the week as i do think by time friday comes we will have filled the gap and seen a vix bounce at 2526 which will cause a spike in the vix like usual i could be wrong but i felt compelled to hold this since its 4dte and i know uvxy loves to move in mysterious ways sometimes overall not a great day for me and further case that if i stopped trading mondays i would be way more profitable
if the us defaults on it s debt will i be able to buy a house attention fellow autists we ve got a burning question about the unthinkable scenario of a us debt default and its potential impact on our dream of owning a house strap in and get ready for some wild speculation wall street style picture this if the us were to default on its debt we re talking about a financial doomsday the repercussions would be catastrophic with interest rates soaring markets crashing and chaos reigning supreme but here s where it gets interesting my fellow degenerates in times of financial turmoil opportunities can emerge amidst the chaos if the housing market takes a massive hit it s not inconceivable to imagine a mad rush of deals and distressed sellers flooding the scene so the burning question is this could a us debt default potentially open up a golden opportunity for us to score a sweet deal on a house imagine the possibility of insane price drops desperate sellers and banks itching to unload properties left and right it s a potential goldmine for those brave enough to take the plunge

fidelity is having trouble exercising my bbby calls so i m on hold right now i had a bunch of bbby calls sold half and exercised half the rep has been asking me all kinds of time wasting questions then tried to get me to accept a talk on more profitable methods of closing an option i had to politely interrupt him and say this will be more profitable i have been on hold for 10 minutes now he just got back and said i am speaking to an associate to hopefully get this resolved today it s been another 10 minutes still waiting is someone missing shares is this the first crack in the basket i don t know but lfg edit i am on hold for a third time he is saying he isn t seeing the confirmation going through he is getting on with a help desk of some sort for support says it s probably because i exercised on a day other than friday call time now at 42 mins edit 53 mins in call is done i recorded from about the 20 min mark will have to edit down due to hold music forever and personal info he said they had to wait for locates and i will be receiving my shares tomorrow i m too smooth brained to know if this is normal or not so i leave that for your own interpretations edit 29 $4 was the strike not the premium

the only true dd here avoid all the noises i was predicting this move today because margin calls already flushed out the sellers from friday s selloff t3 so i fully expected buyers to step in today and it does not come as a surprise to me but here is the dd on the loans and potential bankruptcy if you re interested in reading something from someone like me who has 15 years of active investing anyone who watched how sears went down should already know that drawing down on revolver or emergency loan does not help them avoid bankruptcy don t get me wrong $bbby will most definitely operate the stores until after the holidays but when their cash runs dry they could file for chapter 11 even before the holidays knowledgeable investors are already expecting this types of loans to happen so even though it may come as a bullish surprise for some meme stock investors it is not a surprise for experienced investors despite all the noises you hear on these message boards before a company goes into bankruptcy lenders will always try to benefit from the downfall including issuing loans backed by merchandise and other assets while earning very high fees and interest at little risk to them remember how sears chairman eddie lampert made himself the largest creditor and sears owed him at least $13 billion in loans backed by the company s assets before it filed for chapter 11 also anyone who is hoping for someone to buy the buybuy baby business does not understand what lenders actually think if they can buy some of those assets as part a bankruptcy auction at a much lower price why buy now with the amount of debt they owe it is a hot mess nobody wants to touch right now also as you can see they were unable to issue more shares during the meme stock frenzy which means the board is crippled a crippled board will not be able to package the deal for buybuy baby stores well enough for any potential interested buyers to step in you may hear lots of noises before bankruptcy like certain investors wanting to step in and buy some assets from the company but history of most companies that eventually went into bankruptcy tells us it will not happen until way after they file for chapter 11 most likely months after that a bankruptcy judge will have to approve on the deal conclusion an emergency loan only helps the lenders make money but will not help $bbby avoid bankruptcy and will not help with any shareholder value if anything it only makes the shareholder value smaller in bankruptcy court after all the remaining assets are transferred to the lenders how to benefit from this situation if you want to make certain money and avoid all the noises you hear on message boards just go buy 2023 puts and forget about it and come back in 2023 some facts about sears sears actually got a 350mil emergency loan a month after they filed for chapter 11 on oct 15 2018 to allow the stores to operate through the holidays sears arranges emergency financing 5 days before filing for chapter 11

prelude to my sqqq yolo and why i need this win more than ever first i ll just start off by saying that each and every one of you here who routinely trade options have balls of steel options are fking nuts and i don t know if i ll ever be able to really start trading them last month the most consequential day in my trading career didn t go my way i held 1985 tqqq contracts that i bought on june 23th with a $26 strike and june 24th expiry at $03 i spent $60 000 on those options and at one point their value dropped to sub $20 000 on june 23rd but by the end of the day they made all their losses back and i closed them without a loss or win after being shaken out and scared by their massive decline earlier in the day i was happy to just make my money back but the next day those options opened at $05 up almost 100 and reached over 2$ they would have been worth almost $400 000 at one point and i recall feeling sick to my stomach i will never forget that day and it would have made for some sick gain porn here but to make matters worse instead of buying those same contracts back near the open on june 24th i chased them bought them back way too high and then sold them at a 50 loss 30 minutes before the close on june 24th for a huge loss instead of an over 600 gain and then in the most sinister twist of events those same contracts reversed 5 minutes later and closed 100 higher on the day than my original cost basis so instead of making 600 i could have made an amazing 100 but ended up losing 50 i could barely sleep that weekend and was broken but such are options or maybe i m just a wall street bets degenerate and played with way too much money before i had enough experience and knowledge on how to deal with them the latter is probably true either way i m currently holding 457 sqqq $60 strike july 15th expiry options with a cost basis of $0424 that are doing very well as i type this my hope is that the cpi numbers comes in hot tomorrow and that these will do even better but i don t know if i can keep doing this moving forward i don t have the stomach for it my only hope for this trade is that it does so well that it can grow my account in size to the point that i can make 1 or 2 gains here and there and have it actually be consequential i hope it works out but good luck to everyone here

judge my 401k because i m starting to lose control it s nothing crazy and kinda boring being honest don t wanna clickbait unfortunately it s company based by fidelity so i m quite limited in my options i ve managed to only experience a 36 loss this year so far through ocd handling of it and because i began investing three days ago i m just not seeing a straight forward strategy my theory is nav is going to start going up on bonds as it has they re experiencing rising interest rates as well so although normally bonds are meh for smart investors i m going to start offloading risk the dated funds i d be in are down 12 and 18 respectively side note i saw when i started that blue chip was down like 20 or something ytd when i started so initially i was doing like 2025 contributions so much regret debates right now 25 ihosx and 15 global fidelity fund 2025 bonds as long as nav doesn t get blasted every week like it was doing during july and the other 3540 in the fidelity sp500 mid cap and small amounts in small cap and blue chip to finish off also my strongest earners have been oieqx ihosx and fmcsx small cap performed well until this real hard recession moment it s still okay just not as good and i m now negative in my fidelity spy mirror i also change and have changed my contribution based on when i thought things were under or oversold and changed deviations in the stocks based on what was losing money more rapidly

where is the bottom new home sales fell 166 in april existing home sales have fallen 138 off their highs in january really concerning given that home sales should be historically picking up going into summer also the market is down big again the biggest worry for me is that in all of this we don t seem to have many tools to combat this decline the two used traditionally interest rate cuts and qe are already exhausted i m trying to think that given the losses currently sustained by the market nasdaq down 30 sp down 20 have we started the real recession selling or is this a precursor for the real fall the market dropped 40 in 08 so is that where we could realistically see this headed what do y all think

market outlook 07062022 recap on tuesdays market action spy closed up 019 qqq closed up 171 dow jones industrial closed down 042 vix closed up 307 the major indices gapped down quite a bit today but recovered and were mostly able to close positive with the exception of the dow however the dow isn t as important as the nasdaq or sp 500 but i include it in these write ups just to be complete today s price action was very constructive towards the overall market rally as it showed that early selling was quickly overpowered with buying even with today ending positive it is still a time to be cautious and limit exposure especially since fomc minutes are being released tomorrow typically when there is a fed announcements the markets are quiet and tend to have low volume until the announcement is over spy daily timeframe spy gapped down 140 to start the day and continue to drop and undercut fridays lows volume dried up after breaking the lows and we did not see anymore downside spy then rallied throughout the rest of the day to close above fridays highs volume today was slightly higher than fridays but was still lower than than the 50 day moving average overall today was still productive towards the general market rally qqq daily timeframe qqq gapped down 110 slightly less than spy and quickly gained back is losses and closed well above fridays highs there was also an increase in volume but still below the 50 day moving average qqq also closed above the 8 day ema red line overall qqq had a much stronger day than spy and may be looking to mover higher in the next few days recap on recent positions sso opened approximately 220 lower than friday and continued to drop i sold half of my position as sso broke below fridays lows i then sold my remaining shares as sso approached thursdays lows looking back now it would have been nice to hold but there was no way of knowing that in the moment as we broke into new highs i opened two new positions in both qld and amzn qld is a doubly leveraged etf tracking the nasdaq 100 i made two buys as qld advance into new highs to avoid buying all of my shares at once i also bought amzn since it appeared to be acting stronger than other stocks potential setups since i am in two positions i will mainly be monitoring those and looking to add on the my existing shares aapl daily timeframe however if aapl is able to break its recent high i would consider adding a small position breaking these highs would be another trigger showing the higher low setup is working bringing everything together yesterday was a constructive day in the overall market rally we still have a long way to go but have to start somewhere if you decide to buy stills in the rally do so in small quantities and be sure to cut losses quickly the worst this you could do is to go large there are better times than now to go all in

why every valuation method is wrong hi everyone so this is probably the wrong place to post this but maybe someone can help me i have never made a post here before but i have recently been thinking about the weighted average costs of capital wacc that wall street uses i have concluded that dcf ddm and ri valuation models do not work however this is not because people can not perfectly predict the future and each of these models can vary a lot based on their assumptions about the future but that is not why i think these methods are broken for starters every major firm on wall street uses the capm when determining the cost of equity for a company the company s market cap weights the cost of equity and the cost of debt to form the wacc so i see two main issues here first the cost of debt is straightforward but the cost of equity relies on a very outdated model not to mention the fact that the market cap is derived from the stock price and shares outstanding if we can all assume for a moment that i am right about the cost of equity analysts use being completely wrong then every stock would be mispriced and if every stock is mispriced the wacc that every analyst hypothesizes would be wrong even if an analyst could perfectly estimate future cash flows they would not be able to properly value securities because they would be using an incorrect wacc from capm cost of equity to discount them back to present value and this would mean that the use of the market cap to weight equity and debt would be fundamentally flawed i just remembered when i first took an investment in equities course in college i learned about better alternatives to the capm everyone here has probably heard of the arbitrage pricing theory apt and the fama and french 3 and 5factor models but why does no one use these models i have not been able to get this off my mind lately this is just one example and i am sure there are newer and even better factor models to determine the cost of equity i have done many 3statementmodels with dcf ddm and ri valuations and i am just not realizing how little that matters if everyone is using the capm which only takes a beta with respect to the excess return of the overall market then every assumption is fundamentally wrong wouldn t a multifactor model with statistically significant betas for securities be much more accurate hopefully someone understands what i am trying to say and can help explain i have not slept in a while sorry if this did not make much sense i would be happy to explain further if anyone wants me to x200b ape translation analysts are dumb and wrong most of the time because there are much more accurate models to value stocks also even those models are still shit so we re all better off using good old evrev evebitda pe and pfcf multiples to value stocks
thoughts on trading premiums prior to earnings regards i ve been stewing on this sub for a while bought my first calls on bumble last week to watch them go to zero bought on morning of earnings and watched the premium climb 20 by the time market closed got me thinking can i buy options the morning of or day before earnings and sell before market close just scalping the increase in iv as earnings approach thinking the strategy would be as follows 1 buy weekly otm callsputs close to earnings only strikes with large open interest 2 sell before close as iv rises 3 if premium hasn t risen either ride the gamble through earnings or cut losses on the premium depending on conviction assuming the stock won t move too much in either direction on the day of earnings does the stock have to move in my direction for my premium value to increase even if its otm will iv always increase as earnings approach has anyone succeeded with this or a similar strategy any feedback appreciated

moody s fraud per bard yes moody s investors service a credit rating agency has been accused of fraud and manipulation of the stock market in the past the most significant instance was in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis when moody s was accused of inflating the ratings of residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and collateralized debt obligations cdos these securities were often based on subprime mortgages which were mortgages given to borrowers with poor credit histories as the housing market began to decline in 2007 many of these subprime mortgages defaulted causing the value of rmbs and cdos to plummet this led to widespread losses for investors and contributed to the financial crisis in 2017 moody s agreed to pay $864 million to settle allegations that it had misled investors about the creditworthiness of rmbs and cdos the settlement included a $4375 million payment to the justice department and $4263 million to be divided among 21 states and the district of columbia moody s has also been accused of fraud in other cases in 2013 the securities and exchange commission sec charged moody s with failing to disclose its ties to the investment banks that issued the securities it rated the sec also accused moody s of failing to adequately review the creditworthiness of the securities moody s agreed to pay a $28 million penalty to settle the sec charges these are just two examples of the allegations of fraud and manipulation that have been made against moody s the company has faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory investigations and it has paid billions of dollars in settlements these allegations have raised serious questions about the integrity of moody s credit ratings and the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system
government won t bail out the failing banks so the big banks are bailing out the failing bank with our deposits how is this different like the title says the last time we had banks collapsing the government swooped in and bailed the banks out with tax payer dollars now that this bank failed and another bank is starting to fail the government and politicians which knew it was so widely unpopular when it happened the last time pledged to not bail out the banks so the other big banks decided to bail out the failing bank so last time it was with our dollars and this time its with our dollars just with extra steps x200b so does anyone have any idea what could happen if the first republic bank still fails would the other banks just take massive losses is it time to short other banks in the case that this all implodes or is it time to go long on frc thinking that it will roar back with the support of the others x200b thoughts opinions discuss

so did you ever hear of the tragedy of darth retard the wise no i thought not it s not a story the finance department would tell you it s a wsb legend darth retard was a dark lord of the stonks so powerful and so wise he could use the portfolio to influence the tendies to create gains he had such knowledge of the stonks he could even keep the trades he cared about from going red the dark side of the stonks is a pathway to many trades some consider to be unnatural he became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his tendies which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in the after hours it s ironic he could make the feds rich but not himself would it be possible to learn this power not from an accountant

spy i know the market doesn t make sense sometimes but i don t get how interest rate are high and we are seeing spy looking to to test 420 plus when just last year we had very low interest rate and free money just being pumped spy was around 450 yes the feds are going to slow the pace of hiking interest rates but to me if they say like we are going to start lowering interest rates then to me it makes sense for a market rally i guess i was a little slow on buying calls when the market went bullish after feds meeting but i felt like there was going to be dump coming soon i was over thinking so much i didn t make any moves and just sat on the sideline just cucking it you guys feel like spy will keep rallying or does spy plateau around 420

dte on swing trade after market drop hey guys i know most people in this sub like to swing 0 dte or less than 1 week dte on meme stocks but i want to get everyone s insight on the following after spy drops the vix is higher so if i buy long dated calls when it settles odds are that i d get crushed by iv aside from hedging against volatility have you all found that there s an optimal dte that allows big moves while not getting iv crushed or getting destroyed by theta scenarios 1 if you go less than a week dte you get destroyed by thetagang 2 if you go long dated 6 months vega is higher so iv crush the gist of my question is ultimately what dte gives the best balance of theta and vega for a solid swing trade after spy drops and settles curious to get your perspectives thanks

what is the reason you people sold bbby instead of buying and holding and forcing everyone else to buy as well so we could profit more there is no reason bbby shouldn t be at $500 a share if you did the work even if you don t want too it isn t about you it is about others make us more what is your reason for selling you made some profit maybe for you and what about holding and buying more so others could profit more you should be pushing the stock not selling in case you lose the good of many is more important than just your good so stop being selfish and buy regardless of if you want too or not if you don t explain yourself
nvax deez nuts so idgaf about covid anymore but lots of people do so that s the only thing that matters x200b x200b now for the dd i m going to kiss and break it into 3 parts the situation the opportunity and the big badaboom the situation nvax and covid i ve been digging into nvax over the past week or so and i truly think it has a remarkable set up given current headlines and the recent earnings report they delivered earlier this month for those that don t know nvax is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases the company s proprietary technology platform uses recombinant proteins and nanoparticles to create vaccines that are safe and effective novavax s lead product is a covid19 vaccine that is currently awaiting approval from the fda the vaccine is a proteinbased vaccine that is different from the mrna vaccines from pfizer and moderna novavax s vaccine has been shown to be effective against the original covid19 virus and the omicron variant they do other stuff but all we care about right now is the covid vaccine why well people are freaking out again about covid so you know that a these types of tickers will be top of mind and b nvax is positioned to profit from their vaccine before moving forward it s important to clear up some potential misconceptions 1 nvax is not the same company from 20202021 that completely fucked up the opportunity in front of them a new csuite was brought in earlier this year and they ve been executing very well what proof do i have well they turn a surprise profit this past earnings when the street expected eps of worse that $150 a slight improvement from prior year 1 they ve settled their dispute with their partnered manufacturer and in fact that party sk biosciences just took a 7 ownership stake in nvax at a premium to the price that the underlying was trading actually over a 50 premium kinda nuts x200b x200b the opportunity catalysts the over performance i mentioned from last quarter was driven by exusa revenues that s right they made the majority of their business outside of the usa why well their vaccine is still under review by the fda but the timeline is for an expected decision sometime next month the vaccine is currently being usedistributed under an eua so it stands to reason the approval should come along shortly this unlocks a large portion of the us demographic as a result big catalyst upsies or downsies additionally there is a new strain of covid shocker nvax vaccine is already clinically proven to be resistant to the newest strain of covid that s dominating infections in the us and abroad at the moment x200b x200b and oh yea they ve already been producing it at scale so they re ready to fucking rock and roll and jab you in the dick or arm x200b the big bada boom short interest teeny tiny float nvax has been at the top of the most shorted stocks leaderboards for a while and for good reason as mentioned above they completely fumbled the ball back when covid showed up and their management team was completely inept however now that the csuite was turned over and they re actually performing well that narrative is gone but for some reason shorts have only piled on even more in fact since the prior finra exchange reported short interest report shorts have added about 10 more to their positions moving from 36m shares sold short to almost 40m x200b you ll note that the si of ff is 45 but that s wrong commonly the float is calculated by the freely traded shares which usually subtracts 13dfg filings from the outstanding share count as of the latest earnings the outstanding share count was 100m x200b of that about 59m is accounted for via 13dfg yes yes yes many of those parties can and do loan out shares regardless it means a lot of shares are spoken for and can easily be recalled if so desired that puts the more accurate float around 35m shares also worth noting that some major holders are adding to their positions like state street who increased their 13g stake from around 6m to 104m so if my calc above is a more accurate float it might not be then si as a of ff is closer to 113 so why isn t this stock going apeshit right now well again many tute holders most likely are loaning out shares and earning yield very cool and very legal why might that change well if something fundamentally changes ie a vaccine being officially fda approved that might alter the dynamic also a lot of mouth breathers are afraid of mrna vaccines and the nvax offering is differentiated from the mrnabntxpfe offering as it s the only proteinbased vaccine so bill gates can t control your brain with the nvax vaccine you should definitely request it by name to your medical professional x200b you can trust me i stayed at a holiday inn express last night my position 1k shares and i ll add calls if the opportunity presents itself

going long on rivian hear me out there is a lot of news going around about rivian and it s recall of all of its cars headlines of articles are saying that there are issues with steering which i guess is true but it s super misleading this recall is out of an abundance of caution there is no inherent flaw with the design of the vehicles just some fasteners that weren t torqued correctly meaning the issue can easily be fixed i d say this is on the low end of severity compare this to gms recent recall of its chevy bolts the whole battery had a flawed design they told consumers not to store cars in their garage and it will cost them $1b so yeah i don t know why the stock decided to plunge 7 long term they have partnerships with both amazon and daimler to build commercial vans i think that is the real moneymaker ford is working on an ev transit but that won t start production until 2026 there are other ev companies lordstown fisker workhorse that don t have nearly the level of productionpartnerships rivian has i think once the supply chain macroeconomics recover it ll go back up probably not to it s ipo level but time will tell

let s talk about the elephant in the room is cramer this bad or is he getting paidkickbacks he is worth close to 250 million and definitely not for his expertise share thoughts even if you think he is an autist we all know cramer mad money has been on since about 2005 he is a fixture on cnbc he preaches to be there for us little guys and answers questions what many do not know is that he is now worth close to 250 million it obviously isn t from trading or even managing money it is from tvmediabooks entertainment so is he truly a guru or just an entertainer i believe he is right about 55 of the time which is just awful but what do we all think the problem is his audience daily on tv is 20 million and he has 35 million subs thru social media he has heavy influence on stocks companies media even i watch cramer more for entertainment definitely not financial advice however i notice when he does all these interviews he is always biased towards ceos he never comes down hard on people like scott wapner scott wapner in an interview with cathie wood even said she was clearly wrong i don t think jim would have the guts but we can call agree scott doesn t have 250 million or the influence so the big question is is cramer really a regard an entertainer or is he in everyone s pocket have an amazing weekend be happy and healthy money comes and goes it is made just paper enjoy life
effects of fear in a bear market i remember a conversation i had with a client in february of 2009 i used to work as a mutual fund analyst at the time that was a day when we had seen portfolios down around 40 and there were ppl panic selling like crazy every newspaper every news channel was talking about the subprime mortgage collapse and there was a lot of uncertainty on the street i knew this guy from college and later found out he was one of our clients he calls me and ask of what is happening he was an engineer with a car manufacturer who had just lost his job and his wife was a homemaker i told him about the situation and told him not to panic he had been a good saver over the years and had put together a nice nest egg which on an average day was worth around 800k but bc of the situation it was around 430k his money was in couple different funds i told him to only withdraw what he needs to survive the next 6 months as his house was already payed off i said get any job even a minimum wage job just keep money coming in keep applying to jobs where you can use your degree engineering gig but whatever you do do not sell anything more than what he needs for a few months me and him got into an argument about not selling i told him that even if it all goes to 200k tommorow is another day and that he should have confidence in american businesses over a long period of time i told him that bear market over corrects in situations like this and not only he should not be selling if anything he should be buying more bc the valuations were crazy cheap he said it was ppl like me that was the problem he called me a wall street scumbag not surprisingly he did not take my advise and sold everything i saw him today and he was the one that brought up the call and he apologized he said that according to his calculations if he had just left his account alone he would have had more than 14 million today fear forces ppl to do weird things very illogical things but if they would just ride it out than they realize the true power of compounding

how to select key entry opportunities x200b we can see in the trend of this candlestick that the price formed a new peak compared with the macd line below the macd green area and peak height of the second price peak are smaller than the first similarly the price fluctuated around the pressure level of 17420 without forming an effective breakthrough this is the perfect opportunity to add short positions x200b switch to the longterm and observe the previous intraday opportunities you can see that the basic shock structure has been completed in the new chip concentration area and the price has also reached the upper pressure line of the chip concentration area and a new round of decline will start at any time a new round of decline just in time to form the f area drawn in the macd that we judged 1 month ago patience and discipline are essential

agco s special dividend my attempt at betting i m not really a betting guy but i took a little chance on this and wanted to share it i m a long time agco holder i prefer it to deere even though i own jd equipment so here s what i did separately from my long term holdings i bought some call options on agco 18 130 and 11 150 for the sole purpose of taking advantage of a slight bump that might happen leading up to 520 for the special dividend which is $450 normally the dividend doesn t impact my decision but agco got crushed last week dropping into the 118 s so it felt right i m assuming that i ll be able to sell my calls later this week but if it does well i ll probably hold them into june just because i think agco was on its way back to the 140s before all the selling off weighed it down some quick info agco rev 111b up 2174 2021 vs 2020 agco net income $897m up 100 2021 vs 2020 agco eps $121 up 10023 2021 vs 2020

railroad union strike potentially starts on sept 16 do you think it could be the next impetus for new market lows do you expect it to cause further impact on the already high inflation especially considering that a lot of things fuel food etc is transported by rails inflation hanging around 8 and further shorted of daily necessities might further increase the prices do you think such an impact will be shortlived days weeks months this will possibly also make fed s job more difficult or will it not the supply chain already seems to be in a terrible spot so this strike might add to the problems that already exist in that space too what do you think it all seems to be pointing to further doom assuming there is no deal by the end of this week this issue seems to be going on for a while but has only caught my attention more recently as the cooling period ends on sept 16
$eose the shitty spac mounting the greatest comeback of all time tldr this shitty spac $eose is going to be catapulted by a near term catalyst in the form of a huge cheap loan from the department of energy and the inflation reduction act and a new production process that will finally make this company fantastically profitable positions $eose 304 298 shares eos energy ticker $eose is probably the most exciting opportunity i have come across since going balls deep into tsla during the covid meltdown i m going to lay out exactly why i ve built up a 7 figure position in the stock i have been itching to share this dd on wsb and watching the market cap like a hawk so that i can finally post this dd when eose breaks the $500 million market cap requirement eos energy is gridscale battery manufacturing company that builds long duration energy storage batteries it builds zincbromide batteries which unlike lithium ion counterparts have virtually zero fire risk using significantly cheaper and more available raw materials inputs that can all be sourced within the usa eos is based in new jersey and its main manufacturing facility is located in turtle creek pa it went public via a spac in 2020 significant investors include point72 steven a cohen the koch family which own convertible notes vanguard and legal general group plc this is a shitty spac that is teetering on bankruptcy let s get the bad out of the way as of dec 31 2022 the company a former despac flameout was roughly 2 quarters away from bankruptcy based on cash burn and money in the bank in q1 they managed to avoid barreling towards bankruptcy only through the magic of massive dilution second bad point eos raised that money from some of the absolute worst sources of capital available to shitty public companies an alternative lender read loan shark named yorkville advisors yorkville finances eos through a secondary equity purchase agreement sepa which allows eos to raise debt at will from yorkville the problem is that yorkville can at any time call that note and force eos to issue shares to yorkville to pay off the note at a discount to the lowest daily average over the past 5 or so days yorkville then dumps the shares on the public market causing intraday swings of 10 or more i suspect yorkville is actually shorting the shares in advance of acquiring the shares using the worst trading methods possible to depress the share price as much as quickly as possible then covering using the sepa yorkville gets all of its shares under the sepa at the lowest intraday average price so the bigger the delta between when it starts selling and the lowest price the more yorkville makes this is the biggest risk in the near term for eos that it will need to raise more capital tanking the stock leaving us as bag holders but we have help on the way enter jigar shah the head of the department of energy loan program office who is making it rain on green tech companies to the tune of $400 billion heres the good news its going to get a huge cheap department of energy title 17 loan the department of energy s loan program office is about to swoop in and provide a minimum of $250 million dollars of financing which is an immediate catalyst to sending eos to the fuckin moon eos has been pursuing this loan for over a year and everything points to an imminent approval of the loan for the following reasons 1 eos is the only major player in the nonlithium ion gridscale battery pack a major focus of influential senators including none other than joe manchin the chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee 2 eos sources over 90 of its materials for its batteries from the united states this also helps it qualify for additional tax credits under the ira which we ll talk about below 3 eos estimates that the loan will help it generate 700 new jobs in a key battleground state for the upcoming elections pennsylvania where its main manufacturing facility is located 4 at an investor conference on jun 9 2023 the ceo said this about how the loan is progressing eos is in the final innings with the process and has solidified most of the commercial terms the company s attorneys are working through the final punch list of items after which it will be submitted for treasury final review that review process should be completed within 30 days of submission and if approved will be followed by an official announcement oh and by the way jigarshah tweeted in a subsequently deleted tweet on april 1 that many announcements are coming to pittsburgh and the ohio river valley if eos gets the loan this would completely remove bankruptcy risk priced at 10year treasury plus a slight risk premium making the company fully investable for investment funds looking for exposure to the only us based non lithium storage company delivering commercially deployed batteries eos is a huge beneficiary of the inflation reduction act eos gets incredible benefits from the inflation reduction act hitting all sides of the income statement energy storage installations are eligible for the following ira benefits of which eos can qualify for every single one 1 a 30 investment tax credit to the buyer for installation of energy storage 2 a 10 tax credit to the buyer for domestic content 3 a 10 tax credit for installation of the storage in an energy transition zone 4 eos gets a $35kwh production tax credit for cell manufacturing 5 eos also gets a $10kwh production tax credit for domestic battery module assembly 6 finally a 10 qualifying tax credit for active electrode material costs there is near infinite demand for energy storage as of dec 2022 eos had an order backlog for committed orders of $535m a lot of orders were sitting on the side lines waiting for guidance on domestic content for the 10 additional tax credit mentioned above and the company is currently projecting for $1b of new booked orders for 2023 this translates to roughly 6 gwh of backlog on a longer timescale the company had another $15 billion of lois another $7 billion of active proposals and $10 billion of lead generation available to be converted to loans look for another ldes provider at scale there aren t any the only competitors are tesla and fluence that sell lithium ion grid batteries at about twice the cost of eos eos battery economics are turning a corner in q1 eos produced the last of its handmade second generation battery q2 will be dedicated to transitioning to a semi automated production line that will significantly improve economics and scale and q3q4 will be all about the ramp eos touts the following improvements between z2 and z3 batteries 1 15 immediate improvement in cost structure with another 1535 gained by deploying automation that has already been ordered 2 cycle times for production vastly decreased resulting in 9x battery output 3 q1 2022 to q1 2023 has already seen a 24 decrease in cogs during which time revenue increased by 168 on an absolute basis not per unit the company has already put down payments on long lead time items critical to manufacturing the z3 batteries eos doesn t talk about its ultimate target cost per kwh but its main competitor redflow a tiny even earlier stage zinc based battery company based out of australia that doesn t get the benefit of the inflation reduction act hopes to achieve a $100 per kwh cogs eos has significant baked in value eos is projecting for approximately 6 gwh of backlog at the end of 2023 which results in $270 million of production tax credits which will be paid to the company on top of that eos being a shitty spac has significant net operating loss carry forwards which can be used to offset future net income similar to all the people who post loss porn on wsb but with an actual chance to make money going forward and recapture that value as of december 2022 it was sitting on $485 million of nol carry forwards in q1 2023 it lost another $71 million if you estimate another $100 million of nol in 2023 a 21 corporate tax rate that s approximately $135 million of value to eos together with the production tax credits there are about $400 million in value of tax benefits or about 80 of its current market cap shout out to zerosumgame33 on twitter for leading the charge on eose and the rest of the twitter eose mafia including brynkahrl ryanthawks cluster6

i called powell s bluff the great market wheeze is almost upon us i predicted the crash in september 2021 due to higherthanexpected inflation pushing up bond yields and down stock multiples i advised cash shorting bonds emerging market and defensive dividend stocks i m calling powell s bluff then in may 2022 i called 3 700 the fair price for the sp anything below a steal upcoming softerthanexpected inflation data leading to a fed pivot i advised hypergrowth stocks like shopify i was right and i made money i will tell you what will make money going forward the response first here s what people had to say back in may about inflation turning growth stocks oversold and fed pivoting end of year narrator he was in fact not on the money this is gonna be so horribly off the mark it s going to be hilarious can t wait to come back here a year from now oh man those stocks are junk the shopify anything below $300 is a steal is funny when shopifys pe is rn still above 300 its gonns steal your money yes $shop 12 hypergrowth is far from oversold we have a very long way to go market has entered the bear market and is going to meltdown well into 2023 i m 75 cash and going to buy up big time near the bottom emerging markets are about to suffer through the worst famine in our lifetimes i m not clear that is going to lead to market outperformance over the next year wheat pricebushel 35 x200b my philosophy this all really isn t that complicated us humans aren t much smarter than chimps and so anything we create won t be complex it s in the interpretation of these very simple core systems that we project a bunch of meaningless abstractions on top financial markets are not moral they don t exist to punish the wicked and reward the righteous when the doomsayers come out to tell us we re about to suffer for our sins they misunderstand what game we re playing financial markets are not that important interest rates quantitative easing stimulus deficits reserve currencies etc are all things we made up to control the flow of madeup stores of value through a financial lattice that we made up they re far more reactive to realworld events than drivers of realworld events we ve had tech bubbles at high rates in the 902000s we ve had them at low rates the whole spectrum from booms to busts can happen in a diverse multitude of fiscal environments developed nations will continue to surprise at how quickly they can overcome even the seemingly most dire financial crises because we made all of finance up it can only hurt you as much as you let it ie the great depression how to make money buy hypergrowth like $shop the stocks that were hit hardest on deep recession fears and rising rates will do the best when the opposite happens much like how quantitative easing direct financial stimulus closing manufacturing and lowering rates increased inflation and then when we did the opposite it decreased inflation shopify is a great business that i have the scoop on buy these now shopify $shop sartorious srtde emerging market local currency bond etf $emlc daikin $dkily x200b here s a more fun play covered call etfs sell covered calls and pay out the premium as dividends the more volatility the more you get paid one i like is $jepq it s an actively managed covered call etf on tech stocks it currently has an sec dividend yield of 199 you get some of the asset appreciation as tech recovers but i also think there will be an extended period of chop ahead as the fed remains stricter than normal and mixed inflation data comes out this allows me to profit from both i m taking a position on 4x leverage at the current yield that s an 80 dividendyear minus margin interest as the dividends are paid out my position becomes less and less risky after a year my 4x leverage position will be only 22x leverage if dividend yields remain this high the dividends will be rolled into more growth stocks the dividends on $jepq will likely not remain this high forever but you get the idea good luck fellas

bbby august saga with pictures if you ve only been noticing bbby since mid august you probably think things look dire for bbby but on this labor day weekend i decided to labor over candles and see what actually happened to bbby in the month of august there are some very interesting date coincidences when comparing price and naked short interest x200b notice that boom on 82 coincides with the subsequent naked short volume the very next day hedgies want to grab bbby by the balls and control the price but do they x200b ah the squeeze days from 812 to 818 bbby went parabolic hedgies had lost control they were still heavily short the possibility of hedge funds actually going bankrupt from this was very real something drastic needed to happen and it did x200b wild august for sure we re literally back where we started but the conditions are very different there s no fear of bankruptcy trading volume is higher than it was in early august and most importantly there are no naked shorts controlling the price also chart wise it s looking bullish this is not financial advice just some degen dd

powell s fomc speech all but guarantees rate cuts in 2023 so when you hear the economists predicting that inflation could reach 2 by midyear 2023 it isn t just wishful thinking it s a tactful analysis on the impact a slowing economy lagging rate hikes recessionary fears and a 40yearhigh relative comparison midyear was the inflationary high of 2022 the bottom line powell saying that fed will consider cutting rates when the fed is confident that inflation is moving towards 2 is like saying forget everything i said about staying the course forget about higher for longer we re turning the money printer back on sooner than you think article makes the point that high yoy inflation comparisons will likely take us to lower cpi readings and consequently give powell room to cut rates do you agree with this

half of ryan cohans shares and all of his call options are subject to 6 month shortswing rule the shortswing rule basically states that any profit from sales of securities that were purchased within 6 months would goto the company on ryan cohan s 13d form for bbby it shows the date of his purchases at the bottom as of today 4 100 000 shares are not subject to the 6 month shortswing rule the rest of his 3 680 000 shares as well as all of his call options are still subject to the shortswing profit rule all of his call options would come out of the 6th month period on sept 1st or 2nd basically he can t sell his options and almost half his stock unless he wants to donate that money to bbby would be crazy if he actually sold his calls during a major runup to donate the money to bbby and help out with debt but that is a little too retarded for me to think about much him being part of a pump and dump doesn t make much sense since he cant sell half of his shit and also that the price is barely above what he bought in for also considering he never sold a single stock of gme during any of its runs gives me some confidence that he isn t in it for the money
confident in $tesla is starting to fade i make $800 from tesla yesterday i m glad that i m able to empty my bags what do you think will happen next week $170 i definitely get in again if it fall around that price range and probably sell it out when it up elon had set the new price ceiling for tesla when he sell his shares around $190 so hang in their guys
charles schwab and ge alright gather round little regards i m not going to lie to you charles schwab is my brokerage but let me tell you all the story of general electric in 2008 in the early 2000s ge made their money mostly through ge capital which was their finance and lending arm they leveraged the good name of ge and the manufacturing arm to build a truly sizable lending program that all fell apart doing the 2008 financial crisis aland they had bad loans on their books for years and years after the fact and ended up having to secure funding from warren buffett himself history doesn t repeat itself but it rhymes charles schwab is currently and has been moving more and more into the investor checking and other investor lending programs using their brokerage good will and name as their backdrop personal example over the last 10 years i ve gone from using just their brokerage account to now having checking and other related accounts with them while the investor checking and other banking functions are a small portion of their business i m fearful at this point that they did not properly invest their banking funds and it could might pull the entire business down between schwab and credit suisse we re staring down the next domino s to fall and see how they get sorted out credit suisse is a wild card we don t know how the swiss will back up their bank and it won t look good or feel good to the tax payer if we do it for them tldr positions vix c 30 32223

government assisted retirement plans hey guys i just had a thought trip over a wrinkle in my head its relatively easy to get a 300k mortgage why not apply the same borrowingrepayment structure to retirement accounts when people turn 18 so you turn 18 congrats why not offer a 300k loan from the government that goes directly into an account for you that is invested in sp500 dow nasdaq boring boomer shit and you repay the loan through regular structured payments over 50 yearsretirement 68yrs and if you cant make payments you would forfeit the original investment and keep any gain when you reach the established retirement age i mean yeah the value of the investment products could go down but over 50 years and not breaking even would be pretty interesting and consider if 300k was being pumped into the market each 18 year old having a birthdayspy calls what could go wrong

student loan payment doomers are overreacting ok i m very stupid so take what i m going to say with a mountain of salt but aren t people overreacting to the continuation of student loan payments feel free to correct because i havent been paying full attention to the repayewhatever the name plan is but here are some reasons why i think this 1 inflation has been huge for a while now and supposedly it should be slowing down so if it s slowing down and employment is going up then it s more than likely that young people can afford repayment due to no longer getting reamed in the ass by inflated prices as much if inflation does continue to be high then it s not really the student loan payments that are fucking up the economy but inflation 2 again i have a very smooth brain so probably wrong on this but i thought i recalled a detail that said people who are unemployed can continue to pause interest accrual on non private student loans until they find a job in which case the ditch unemployed people are in won t get much deeper 3 i can t speak for the majority of people but as someone who graduated during covid the pause allowed me to save up money and now i can pay off my loans in full but i d rather continue my poor options run down 72k or 75 all time so i can get a shiny flair or something but my point is i think people are underestimating the portion of 20 something year olds around my age that can afford to pay back a sizeable portion or at least the largest interest accruing loans yes a majority won t be able to but i m saying a proportion larger than we currently expect last this is not investment advice but that run you saw on semiconductor the first half of this year i can see that happening again next year tsmc announced a year delay for their fab back in july which is right around when everything started tanking their us location has several phases planned and while they are struggling to man it i don t see the us allowing them to fail because smic will be on their ass and has the advantage of chinese sweatshop worker mentality tldr student loan doomers are overreacting because they are broke and tech run up will 2peat next year

what are your thoughts on stock trading bots i ve seen a few ai stock trading services being advertised on various social media platforms and i am wondering if anyone here has used one if so what did you think i ve been debating about using one i would be way more apt to use one if i can find one that is free to use and takes a cut if you make money i can see the logic behind a stockpot but i am not sure how easy it is for ai to actually predict the market based on observable trends i think i have been doing a decent job picking stocks but i am also constantly looking at ways to deverisfy
is the top in 12723 spy es futures and tesla weekly market analysis and recap well last week i mentioned that we were on a road to 410 and that based on previous prefomc weeks we should have expected about a 4 move and i was targeting 4095 4088 well we came within 64 cents of 4088 and actually popped over 4095 on futures the question remains is the top in or does this rally have more room to go keep in mind that wednesday next week if fomc week jpow will deliver not only a rate hike but also more importantly is he will give guidance about futures fed rates x200b taking a look at the cme fed watch took it is now a 9998 chance that we will get a 25bps hike on wednesday and not only that we are pretty much guaranteed a 25bps hike on wednesday thanks to our bouy nick timiraos who is the unspoken jpow leaker remember he is the famous wsjer who in june leaked ahead of the meeting a 100bps hike during the feds quiet time if nick is saying 25bps then we are going to get a 25bps now again the question remains what comes after a 25bps is jpow really going to stop hiking rates honestly probably not also every fed speaker and even jpow himself before we had fed quiet time said that we were going to need to continue to raise rates for me i would be pretty shocked to hear jpow not signal another rate hike in march there is no way even if he wants to that he would shock the market with a 50bps but i really think we see a 25bps and that jpow will say something along the lines of we will remain data dependent but its far too early to pause still the issue here is going to be if jpow is not hawkish enough we really are going to see a very incredible really here that is going to make this market crash even hard spring summer jpow has to say all the bear buzz words or we are going to be looking at 430 spy in the off chance that jpow says this is the last hike then hang on to your hats cause the bull trains gonna rip outta the station daily wise here we have an interesting move here on one hand we broke through that critical 4053 level i was talking about and i said that we needed to watch closely however we have this really nice blue bull channel with a black rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected the resistance of with the pretty impressive nearly $2 eod sell off we finally saw some weakness to be honest for the last week or two we have seen extreme weakness in the morning followed by uniformed and market wide dip buying from mid day till eod however with fomc next week we could finally see this slow the bulls did close over that purple channel resistance of 4053 however with this inverted hammer candle there is a very high probable evening doji star pattern formed here and we very likely could come right back down to that 403 support area monday x200b the weekly is where things get intriguing as i had mentioned on the daily we did break through the 2223 bear market resistance line so therefore we are out of that we also broke through the weekly bear market resistance line too highlighted here is a potential inverse head and shoulder i have been eyeing for weeks now if this plays out then that means 4088 is our top while we did not quite hit 4088 today we actually did reject at the weekly resistance for september 6th and the november 28th top we very well could see 4088 as our top or just short of it and form a nice weekly double top for a potential sell off back to previous support of 3987 however if bulls can break through that 4088 resistance then we have a pretty clean shot at 41774 bear market resistance line if jpow happens to go too dovish or if the market just wants to go bullishly and ignore him cause they don t believe the fed then we are very likely going to see over the next 23 weeks a push to 4275 resistance the biggest thing i want to point out here is this red horizontal channel this is my 2023 range channel i have been pointing out since december highest probability is that we range in this 3756 to 4088 channel if you give yourself enough dte this is a great put opportunity for a retest of 390 the closer we are to 409 and especially to 427 the lower the reward to risk is on calls the case for puts begins to build and grow up here key spy weekly supports 3986 3901 3831 key spy weekly resistance 4088 41774 4275 x200b the rising wedge within the bull channel on futures is even more extreme and convincing of a pullback then that of spy now on spy we did break through that key 4053 resistance and close over it however on futes we did not we actually broke over 4095 and broke through the overall bear market resistance line however we hard rejected and are going to close near 4083 within the red consolidation channel with this doji candle here the evening star doji pattern is very alive here also looking at the rising wedge support line unless futes opens over 4100 we are going to break that support line which should result in a pullback x200b very similar play out here on futures weekly we had just a enough move up to wick over the 4105 bear channel resistance however the bulls fumbled at the 5 yard line and we ended up hard rejecting and closing under key pivotal 4095 channel resistance remember this 3770 to 4095 is the same as the 3756 to 4088 channel i mentioned on spy i have been calling for 4095 as a key level here for a while now if we continue to reject here we very well will see a sell off next week we did manage to close over the 4075 november december double top though 4020 is my most likely target for a pullback and 4150 is most likely target on a bigger push up key futures weekly support 4075 4020 3970 key futures weekly resistance 4095 4150 4180 4280 x200b and then there was tesla tesla has put in a pretty incredible two day nearly 22 rally a pretty incredible rally fueled by not only the ev market but also its earnings there was a lot of meme stocks rallying this week and today which tells me the top is very near tesla has incredibly came within $7 of its daily 100ema after being no where near it for the last 4 months x200b if you thought the daily was impressive lets take a look at this weekly chart tesla just closed out a 3334 green week from as far back as i could see and test on tv unless i missed it this could potentially be the biggest green week that tesla has ever had there was some impressive and notable 2830 green weeks but i did not see any other weeks 30 even more incredible is the fact that in the last 4 weeks tesla has rallied 77 one month to recover 77 or about $79 is absolutely incredible i actually really wanted to short tesla eod with a 30dte put however the premiums seemed way too high to short i also am not convinced this doesn t have just a little bit more to go i mentioned that key 1765 resistance on tesla and we did see a big of a fight there today however we broke through that and actually touched the weekly 20ema and are now in range of the weekly 200ema the next major resistance levels on tesla are 1953 and 2073 i favor the highest probable rejection at 1953 and actually will look to dca into a put position there now while i am bearish strictly because this is just too much too fast tesla did break through this red bear channel here that dates back 4 months and now is in a new black bull channel if you look back at november and december you can see how much fighting occurred around that weekly 200ema this is going to be a bigger fight here key tesla weekly support 1785 164 150 key tesla weekly resistance 1953 2074 x200b the vix is actually one reason i am skeptical and i am actually after being a bull for the last 34 weeks thinking it is almost time to be a bear again or atleast neutral today during the run up we had mid day we actually watched the vix spike during that and then incredible eod while the spy dumped we saw the vix dump too the biggest thing i am seeing here is a potential double bottom rejection off that 183 level if you look back to january 13th also a friday we saw a very similar pattern happen the next day the vix spiked 551 and while spy had a tight range day with a doji evening star pattern formed that day the followed day spy dropped 158 now i have mentioned before that i do not fully trust the vix however much like on january 19th when the vix had an evening doji star pattern and spy had a morning doji star pattern if the vix and spy are showing inversing patterns which means they are in agreement then i trust the pattern i mentioned today that spy closed out that evening doji start pattern and looking at the vix this very well could be a morning doji start pattern also that would mean monday the vix will get a nice reversal most likely back over 19 and spy should monday see a pretty good sized reversal not only that its clear any time the vix breaks to 18 today we did break to 1797 putting in a new 52 week low that there is a top formed with fomc on wednesday as bulish as these markets are we very well could see the vix rise slightly and we could see some risk come off on spy too x200b something else to factor in next week is earnings of course amd on tuesday otherwise we are pretty clear sailing until thursday where we get a pretty big day with google and apple which could very likely be a wild storm with fomc the day before x200b weekly log x200b i actually put in a small $10 day today easily could have taken it to a green day during ph but i didn t trust price action and rightfully so as we got that $2 sell off however i put in another great week this week back to back great weeks of trading here so far actually put in a slightly lower win rate this week at 786 compared to last weeks 891 however i had some great wins that made this a very profitable week too i was able to secure two nice weekend swings to start the week off too now i did play some longer dte trades that i ended up holding over night however i don t count those as swings as i was playing a longer level to level vs trying to capture an over night swing move it s hard to differentiate honestly as some swings are level to level plays but not all swings are level to level plays overall another great week in the books

why the economy won t crash there will be no landing it will only go higher us is slated on track to run 23 trillion fiscal deficit this year potentially larger than in 2021 that is equivalent to 710 of gdp to understand just how unprecendted this is 2 out of the last 3 years have resulted in the greatest spending spree by governments since wwii and this year is slated to be at a similar level 1942 a year after the attack on pearl harbor and us entrant to wwii and full mobilization for the war effort was underway the amount of money in the system is simply insane over the past 3 years we have deficit spent more than the entire economy of japan unlike quantitative easing which is just an asset swap here take this $100 reserve asset for your $100 treasury bond ok you aren t richer that $100 isn t cycling in the economy more deficit spending is pure injection of monetary heroin into the economy it goes to wages it then goes to products and services and multiples itself through the economy it also gets injected into 401ks and turns into flows into equities the us economy is simply booming from the raw injecting of heroin the goverment is giving to it it will have a hangover eventually and we will probably die as a result but now is the time to party like its 1999 x200b

the bear case for northrop grumman $noc while northrop beat earnings expectations today their stock dropped but that is not the focus on hand you may have heard of viasat $vsat stock dropping 30 2 weeks ago because of their $700 million satellite failed to deploy its reflectors once in space the spacecraft is boeing which was successfully launched by space x s falcon heavy the part that failed is one of the most important the antenna and without it working it is ultimately a complete loss northrop grumman is the one responsible for the antenna as noted here in their data sheet flawless performance with 100 on orbit success right anyway viasat s satellite is insured up to $420 million but the way space insurance works is that not one company insures the entire piece what these space insurance companies do is put up a bid for covering parts of the satellite they will tell you under which conditions they will pay out how much they will pay for a loss and how much it will cost for the service it s a long complicated process which will have a major impact on the space industry once the claim is filed even if somehow viasat manages to be comped all $420 million they re still on the hook for the rest of the $280 million would they eat the cost no they re going to come after ng with a huge lawsuit that would range from $280m being the minimum to the entire cost of the satellite $700m x200b now you might be wondering why don t they just fix the satellite or send over a team to space at this point a manned mission to repair something floating in space will cost much more than to just sent an entirely new one up the ground team from ng can only do so much and it s not looking good far more likely for the satellite to end up being a piece of space junk from this article in a statement to channel futures viasat said we had an unexpected event during the deployment of one of the satellite s reflectors which may materially impact the viasat3 americas satellite our team is working very closely with our reflector manufacturer to take corrective action yet they are still in the early stages of working through the event and its root cause and expect to gather additional data in the coming weeks viasat said they would share more information during the company s earnings call next month since ng did not talk about this during their earnings call i m fully expecting viasat to speak up during their earnings report on 89 it s also possible for news of a lawsuit to drop before then ps i see fellow regards here buying $rtx calls this lawsuit will definitely have an impact on the entire aerospace industry i d be cautious x200b tldr buy $noc puts dated 811 or 818

the bulls and bears continue to fight 22323 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis well that was probably one of the most impressive v bottom recoveries we have seen on spy in many months a straight drill of $6 followed by a $5 rally absolutely an impressive but frustrating day to trade that morning sell off has absolutely no chill at all we straight dumped without even the thought or whisper of a pullback that was one of the most aggressive downtrends we have seen in a while what is even crazier is that we managed to recover it all x200b tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data consumer spending persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get pce and core pce with the preliminary pce numbers along with ppi cpi we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in i will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers the markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary pce hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all however most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump x200b the biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 39993 now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from january 23rd and candle body support from january 30th you can see that this 4006 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level back in january when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row and then back tested support of before we broke out bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength however we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of december when we were in the 380s there is a very clear uptrend break however the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first my thoughts are that if we get a good pce beat tomorrow as in lower than expected then we could see a push back to retest daily 8ema 4053 resistance if we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest rejection and bearish for next week however a recovery back over 4053 would be extremely bullish if we get hot pce and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks a closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 3966 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater key spy support 4006 3985 3966 key spy resistance 4015 4032 4053 x200b taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018 the biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level as long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion the biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though key futures support 4010 3998 3985 3965 key futures resistance 4030 4055 4085 x200b tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 1971 for the 4th day in a row now as long as 1971 support continues to hold we shouldn t expect a bigger sell off yet the last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth it is clear that the upside momentum has slowed however it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming tesla is holding a nice 1971 to 2048 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown key tesla support 2021 1973 1918 key tesla resistance 205 2092 2143 x200b the vix finally came down and have a nice gap fill today it did maintain daily 8ema support also the vix doesn t give us a whole lot of direction here at all however holding daily 8ema support should be bullish as in markets will continue down however if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 4053 resistance becomes even more probable daily log x200b not too bad of a day trading today i got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started and honestly based on everything i saw at that moment and my rules i would take that play again it was a good play just didn t work out only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal historically speaking despite what spy and 2022 wants us to believe to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn t be expected take a look at tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity i expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts i had a few times i could have exited green but again i really did expect a push back to lod and probability suggested the same i was happy that i was able to close all of my 30dte besides amd nvidia at the lod on spy which was also the lod on them the only ticker i would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been google overall looking at spy weekly and tech as a whole weeklies outside of nvidia there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next cpi fomc however we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405

$asle dd aeraware is a revolutionary technology with imminent faa approval and it is not priced in i am bullish on aersale asle with over $113 000 in calls due to its legacy business being undervalued and several upcoming potentially positive catalysts of note they are very close to faa approval and commercialization of their enhanced vision system aeraware business background aersale is an aircraft management and aviation technology company they operate with a few segments outlined here asset management solutions asle buys then leases and sells used aircraft engines and other parts the general strategy in this business segment is to ride the wave of aging aircraft and reselling to budget conscious customers eg low cost carriers on a macro level they accumulate more inventory at great prices when the market is lessthangreat and sell at a premium when there s a shortage and companies are needy aircraft and component mro mro stands for maintenance repair and overhaul this segement does exactly what it sounds like and includes general maintenance and repairs but also aircraft conversions for example from commercial passenger to freight as you can imagine the asset management solutions segment is highly complimentary to this one engineered solutions this segment focuses on new technologies to meet a number of needs including more affordable safety solutions and improved fuel efficiency the excitement and imminent catalysts for asle are in this segment with their aeraware heads up display enhanced vision system outlined below aeraware s imminent approval and value aeraware is a wearable heads up display unit that allows commercial aviation pilots to see through rain snow and fog by using infrared cameras installed on the plane s exterior this technology is a game changer and there is nothing else like it on the market or even close to getting faa approval now to be fair aeraware has been delayed substantially for reference in october 2021 prescience point capital management published a report calling aeraware approval imminent the delays have been substantial and unforeseen in the past but this time does feel different earlier this year the faa communicated with the company that they would need to pass 5 stages of test flights the first four stages were completed in h1 23 during the first four stages of testing the faa found minor issues they wanted addressed prior to the 5th round of test flights those changes were implemented and the 5th round of test flights was finally completed on august 19th on the q2 23 earnings call the ceo stated assuming the successful completion of the final flight tests the faa typically issues an stc within 30 days given the press release announcing completion of the test flights how closely the faa worked with aersale to test and develop aeraware and the modifications made prior to the final stage of test flying i believe the stc approval is imminent and inevitable likely before sept 18th now let s assess the value of aeraware in 2021 cowen issued a report estimating that aeraware would sell for $400k per unit at 6070 gross margin we also know that airlines must equip 50 of a single aircraft type with it before it can be used and they must intend to implement it on all aircraft of that type per faa regulations this information is referenced in the prescience point report all combined for 737s which the stc will be issued for it means multiple potential orders for hundreds of planes each representing hundreds of millions of dollars per order due to manufacturing and installation restraints this will be durable income over time but may add $100m highmargin revenue annually for the next several years the company is only valued at $699m total meaning the legacy company value is priced conservatively and aeraware is not priced in at all the opportunity and setup share price has fallen dramatically due to aeraware delays and perceived weakness in the company a few converging events have led to this great setup 1 due to the market cap of the company and the price of aircraft and parts that they buy and lease or sell earnings are very very lumpy quartertoquarter in the last quarter they did not sell an aircraft they were hoping to reference cfo comments on the q2 earnings call 2 decreased revenue and ebitda guidance due to softer freight market demand reference cfo comments on the q2 earnings call 3 there have been substantial notable delays to aeraware which i already noted these delays have led to skepticism which i believe has led to a setup for rapid price rerating once actually approved these notable issues have all come together to dampen the share price as you can see in the chart above but i view this as an opportunity and management seems optimistic as well there s been a ton of insider buying over the couple weeks position $113k in calls on asle
61422 spy daily ta and a breakdown of how to trade fomc are we having fun yet guys 5 red days in a row from high to low a total of $4523 or 122 in one 5 trading sessions i believe this is the worst 5 days in spy history in the last 20 years even the covid drop and 2008 crash was not as aggressive or big of drops as these ones my thoughts are that we were told 50 bps next 3 meetings jpow very rarely does anything he doesnt say he would do if he changes his tune here he knows markets are gonna tank he has to be tactful so he will do something like cpi is peaking and slowing we are doing xyz blah blah blah if we do 75 to 100bps hike right now we are going to wreck xyz so we are still going to do 50bps hike like we planned come august meeting if we see inflation has not peaked as anticipated we will go ahead and do a 100bps hike plus jpow now has an arguably good ppi that beat expectations to use in his favor if we do 50bps hike markets rally if we do 75bps hike we rally priced in if we do 100bps we die though i expected some sort of small rally today into fomc and vix to unwind so at this point really anything is possible however what jpow says will be very important tomorrow and will guide the market for the next month or so in my opinion it was a fairly untradeable and frustrating day today where there was no momentum and no continuation overall we saw spy make 14 total reversals intraday today the biggest of them was the opening hour we saw an immediate sell off followed by a near 10mil volume 15min candle that was arguably trying to breakout only for a volume candle to come in and take us back to drill down after that first 45minutes of movement we just saw sideways burn and failed breakout after breakout 373 support looked extremely strong all day until ph when we broke through it only to see a fairly impressive rally eod bulls really tried their eod but failed to close spy green a very frustrating and untradeable day the daily does show that we are attempting to hold 3735 as support now it was encouraging not seeing a massively red day today also the weekly bounced right at support today if we get a bad fomc tomorrow and we drill we are going to be looking at not only a massive weekly gap but we are going to break fairly large support and be looking to bounce off the weekly 200ema at 363 the vix was a big part of the frustration today in that it just didn t wanna find a trend overall until eod it was unwinding but once she hit that 321 level it rejected fairly hard and bounced causing that eod sell off the vix really needs to get under 32 and look for the 20s again for the bulls to have any hope with fomc tomorrow there is bound to be a lot of fuckery most likely we will see the morning chose a trend from 930am till about 1030am and trade sideways till about 1230pm or so when we will see it inverse itself and trend closer to opening price 2pm is when the fomc rate hike is released we should see a fairly significant move with that this was last fomc as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji jpow started talking at 230pm markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close this way may 4th fomc march 16th same thing we saw markets at 2pm react to the fomc rate hike and by 230 when jpow started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close now for january we didn t have a rate hike but i believe ole jpow finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets so at 2pm when fomc was released we saw the doji like may 4th and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed however this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered i don t really equate this january one to much since there is no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on may and march 2pm march 16th 101 may 4th 05 both ways up first then down 215pm march 16th 05 may 4th down 03 then up 08 230pm march 16th dropped 03 and then rallied 12 may 4th down 11 then up 15 245pm march 16th 05 may 4th 12 3pm to 4pm march 16th 132 may 4th 14 march 16th from 2pm open price dropped a total of 15 in 30 minutes then rallied 25 from 230pm low till 4pm close may 4th from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1 in 30 minutes then rallied 361 from the 230pm low till 4pm close so how do we play tomorrow well i would be looking for about a 1 drop from the 2pm candles opening price so say we open the 2pm candle tomorrow at 375 look for 37125 as a 230pm bottom from there you can expect about a 25 to 36 green rally so you could either open a straddle with 0dte and about 35otm strikes do this at like 155pm set the take profits on both to 3050 and i would be shocked not to see both of them fill or you could open both and set 100 take profits on both and play it that way one of them is almost guaranteed to hit 100 and then the other will be free most fomc meetings you can easily turn 50100 profits a few different times another way to play it and probably the better way to play it is to wait till about 230pm for a bottom or top i guess and buy an option then most likely after 230pm we will see a great move one way or another i would look for the vix as a guide for this too if vix is rocketing and you are thinking calls you are wrong but if vix is unwinding and you are thinking calls then you are right by 245pm we should have a fairly clear direction and you should be safer to enter a play for me i will be waying my options of a 30 take profit straddle placed at 159pm and then i will look for a play at the bottom near 230 to grab a fairly otm option on to ride till at least 3pm 10 challenge overall a fairly frustrating day i took some calls at 10am when we looked to breaking out and everything look fairly bullish but of course those got wrecked pretty quickly i had planned to hold those till tomorrow thinking we would see the big green rally but once we lose 373 eod i knew my hopes of seeing a green close for those were low and i took the l i played a few scalps last 45minutes that all pretty much washed eachother out looking forward to tomorrow and fomc being over and hopefully we get some clearer trend and momentum days overall there was just zero follow through today and by time momentum was confirming a trade it was reversing already these sideways vix days are brutal today was a good day of patience and recognizing when the setups aren t working in your favor sitting cash sometimes is the hardest thing we do and not fomoing into every play x200b sitting cash gang overnight i wont be trading in the morning till probably 12 or so as im on dad duty and kids have swim lessons in the am but i can honestly say i highly doubt ill miss much in the morning as i suspect it to be very sideways

fed increases funds rate 75 basis points per the fed minutes released today at 2pm the federal funds rate will be increased 75 basis points the fed is continuing to be hawkish on inflation indicating that it will likely keep increasing rates to quell prices a 50 bp increase at the next meeting seems likely but that is dependent on inflation readings over the coming months
jeffrey gundlach says the fed should slow down rate hikes because it is pushing the economy into a recession doubleline capital ceo jeffrey gundlach said the federal reserve should ease the pace of rate hikes as the economy is on the brink of a recession the fed should ve done more earlier gundlach said in an interview on cnbc s closing bell overtime the monetary policy has lags that are long and variable but we ve been tightening now for a while and the impact of these tightenings is going to cumulate into a recession i do think the fed should be slowing down on these rate hikes the fed on wednesday raised benchmark interest rates by another threequarters of a percentage point to a range of 3325 the highest since early 2008 the central bank also signaled that will raise rates as high as 46 in 2023 before the central bank stops its fight against soaring inflation i don t think they are going to be able to pull that off gundlach said on the fed s forecast to hike rates to 44 by the end of 2022 i think the economy is going to be showing signs of weakening the series of big rate hikes are expected to slow down the economy the summary of economic projections from the fed showed the unemployment rate is estimated to rise to 44 by next year from its current 37 meanwhile gdp growth is forecast to slump to just 02 for 2022 i do think the unemployment rate is going to go up and i do think we re headed to a recession and i think the fed should have pasted this differently gundlach said but now they re so committed to this 2 that i think the odds of a recession in 2023 are very high i mean i would put them at 75 the socalled bond king added that the inverted yield curve is truly flashing red for economic problems the yield curve inverts when shorterterm treasury rates rise above longerterm yields many economists view the 2year to 10year part of the yield curve as more predictive of a potential recession source bond king jeffrey gundlach says the fed should slow down rate hikes because they are pushing the economy into a recession fed chair jerome powell recently said that they will raise rates as high as 46 in 2023 to fight inflation do you think the us is headed into a recession
slabs the cdo of student loans in 2008 the housing market crash was centered around cdo s and synthetic cdo s this created a bubble based on the idea of who doesn t pay their mortgage well shortly after the 2008 crash bespoke tranche opportunities became a huge part of every market these allowed banks to sell securities in really any with a loan involved one of the most dangerous bto s is the slabs or student loan assetbacked securities the main reason the 08 crash was kicked off is in the cdo securities balloon payments adjustable interest rate loans and a general down tick in the market all kicked in roughly around 0708 on many subprime loans these home owners had horrible credit ratings and should have never been given a loan in the amounts or areas they wanted well now with slabs you have millions of people who took out student loans with zero collateral and zero credit ratings each given thousands of dollars and no way to back out of the loan these slabs are full of the same subprime individuals as the b bb and bbb bonds for housing however it is much worse with covid preventing much of the market from spinning its gears many people took advantage of the student loan payment freeze nearly every student loan payment has been stopped the government is paying the interest rate to keep the securities afloat this could be much worse as bto s also deal with auto loans and credit card debt of all the lldebt listed so far generation z and millennials have the most of if the payments for student loans are unfroze and resumed the default rate would insane we will see markets collapse wholesale this needs to stop this has been happening for centuries and every time the market is bigger and the crash is more complete do you think it could be good to find out when president biden will resume the payments and before that short the position on slabs and autoconsumer credit bto s

122222 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis here is just some fun data this was spys biggest 1 day drop change wise not close price in over 50 years x200b on average after a day like this the following day has a 50 chance of closing red or green with the average close being 02 the following week has on average closed green 833 of the time with an average weekly gain of 229 the following month has on average closed green 556 of the time with an average monthly gain of 216 strictly some fun data to look at also shows that 50 of the time the nasdaq closes down 20 or more it has a follow up year of 20 drop if it doesn t drop 20 again it gains 29 on average well that was a very interesting day we had a very clear bear trend all the way until about 2pm when we all of a sudden found support and saw a very impressive recovery eod the most impressive part of this sell off was that we were at 1301 sell pressure not too long before we saw that recovery take place for those that aren t familiar with sell pressure on a normal day i would consider 101 to 201 very strong also historically speaking one should not expect a trend day to reverse at the eod a trend day should continue in the same direction the others interesting things to note about today is that we had our first phantom range since october if you note the daily range on spy that s published it says our hod was 38621 however this is untrue the actual hod is 38338 x200b now previously it was a given that any time we had a phantom range we would touch it the next day or very shortly after however that is not the case anymore we actually still have a few dp in the 350s that are unfilled covered my last big question of the day is really a two parter the question would be was the sell off from 38338 to 37477 fake or was that eod rally from 37477 to 3805 fake depending on the answer to that question what caused the market wide vix included acceleration of the sell off at 1215pm the vix spiked nearly 10 during that time and we saw what looked like a convincing support area get blown out on spy and market wise stocks all dumped together x200b i know i was gone on vaca so gonna try and do some updating here to play catch up we had that bigger breakdown last week under 3901 which i mentioned should lead to a 378 support test we had a very nice double tap off 378 which led to that nice green day and pop yesterday to retest the daily 8ema resistance at 388 now this is where things could have gone either way we could have broke through daily 8ema and retest 3901 resistance that resistance test would have led to the bigger sell off we see now or it could have resulted in a push up back to 400 however we rejected off the daily 8ema that brings us today with the help of the gdp and jobs data this am we actually saw a pretty red open now on spy you cant see the true pattern due to the phantom wick candle but when we get to futures youll be able to see the pattern more clearly with he phantom wick this is a double rejection off the daily 8ema with a candle body rejection of yesterdays candle body support area at 3832 this inherently is bearish going forward however we had a very large breakdown through 378 channel support and managed a very impressive eod recovery currently we are looking at a massive long wick doji on spy daily on the bearish side with the double 8ema rejection and break through of 378 channel we should expect continued breakdown and a retest of that 378 support and most likely 375 area tomorrow with the vix movement which i will talk about later this all points to further downside however on the bull side of things you could use that phantom print as a sort of magnet area where we would expect a push back to cover fill that area over the next few days this also could be seen as a failed breakdown through 378 and with that eod rally it could be seen as an area where buyers are going to pile back in the biggest thing i am noting on spy right now is that we seem to be in a nice 3792 to 3862 consolidation channel x200b now if we flip over to futures daily you can see a very different pattern this is not a doji but rather a hanging man double top off 3910 this also shows a clear daily 8 and daily 50ema rejection with failure for bulls to break back into the 3910 4095 channel however there is a clear support area down at 3845 that the bears have to take out in order to open the downside futures is in a nice 3845 to 3920 consolidation channel too x200b lets talk about the jpm collar that expires on 1230 historically speaking we see a breakout over the call side of the collar which is currently 3870 and also is currently the futures weekly candle resistance generally speaking the week of collar expiration 1230 is quarterly expiration we see markets come back down and end up closer to the put side of the collar than we do that call side the current upper level of the put side of the collar is 3425 now history doesn t always represent the future but with this clear down trend we are in and overall weakness i am seeing in the market i do believe by eow next week we could be eyeing the 35003600 area on futures for reference the collar at 3425 is a 11 drop from market close today 3500 is 9 drop and 3600 is a 64 drop for reference that means we could be seeing spy near 3389 if we hit 3425 or we could see a range of 34645 to 3564 3500 to 3600 range this remains my thesis going into next week despite how many people are screaming for the santa rally while i think historically that is a thing that ironically happens most of those happen during bull markets i actually would like to see some data and im not sure how to search that data of how many red years for spy had the santa rally and how large they were x200b zooming way out for this one on tesla and ill give you a close up next we have this thicker red bear channel that we are currently trading within since november 2021 i wanted to draw attention to before i zoom in x200b and now zoomed in you can see that we are nearing that support area for reference tesla had a 9 day today currently for tomorrow that support is only 16 away from close that support for tomorrow is 105 now taking a look here you can see we are in a very tight and impressive red sell off on tesla right now we do have a semi narrow black falling wedge that we established support on today most impressive is that we are currently at 14th red day out of the last 16 trading days puts pretty much at any point in the last 16 days had you bought and held long enough would have been green x200b taking a look at the cycle table here we are now at our 15th day of this drop that started on december 1st we are also at 385 total drop in 15 trading days that means this current drop is nearly double the length of time and almost 2x the total drop there is just no relief in site for tesla i will talk about the weekly more tomorrow but i am eyeing 1114 and 944 are next potential support areas that date back to late summer of 2020 x200b now lets take a look at the vix lately i have been saying the vix has been detached from reality and honestly i still fully believe that however today we finally saw some life out of it we had a nice 8 day long bear channel and had a very nice 2 day dump on the vix however today we saw the massive 20 move up at the peak only to fall short and close up 957 this move up did form a very nice double bottom off 2001 i do suspect with a closure back over the daily 8ema and even breaking back through the 236 key resistance at one point that the vix is signaling there is more downside for the markets ahead x200b if we compare to the april bottom of the vix top of the cycle for spy we see an extremely similar pattern we had that support bounce of 197 and then we ended up with a double bottom of the 20 support area which resulted in a big push up on the vix this is still very much so on my radar that we could be seeing a bigger drop in store for the markets with the vix sell pressure and overall market movement we have had the last 2 weeks now i favor that we are going to end up in that 35003600 range come friday night week at the max 11 drop with 5 trading days that s only a 22 drop day to hit it and with the conservative 64 drop that s only 128 drop on average per day daily log been gone on vaca all week and finally was able to get back in the saddle overall a pretty great day scalps were absolutely on fire today and i did have high success with some of my level to level plays i did take losses on spy tesla level to level plays eod when we got that massive 2pm bounce i honestly did not really expect a breakout and recovery eod like that i really am impressed that the bulls were able to get it back over 378 let alone all the way back to 380 i still remain that this was a fake eod bounce and that by eow next week we will be near 350360 x200b did you guys have a great day today

es supportresistance levels by adam mancini as long as above the breakout level at 3800 adam believes es will continue higher to fill out channel es in and ultimately test 397080 then 4020 caveat market is over brought meaning more consolidating will happen or a sharp pullback will occur supports are 38953900 385565 3805 378065 3715 3685 361020 3500 resistances are 3930 397080 4015 i am sure your thinking take this manure to rinvesting hear me out why do you think so many buy high and sell low they see price going up and they buy calls and as soon as they buy the price goes down they blindly purchase just before a resistance level or they see price going down and as soon as they buy puts the price starts going up again they purchase those puts right into a support level i know you are probably not the brightest tool in shed you are probably on your break from flipping burgers and don t have much time but listen to me technical analysis works it s just you are getting your information from morons probably from wsb the crayon lines you are looking probably are drawn by idiotic barely intelligible functioning members of society people that you probably run away in real life or at least ignore okay they might be 23 people here in wsb who know technical analysis so you don t know anything about technical analysis you have a little of money to gamble you work hard at wendy s this is your hard earn money your tired of been poor you decided to buy options give yourself a chance with those options is there someone out there that could help you luckily for you there is a nerd that publishes accurate supportresistance levels his name adam mancini with over 134k followers he publishes supportresistance levels for es daily in his twitter account okay i should explain this since you are probably slow es sp futures is almost identical to sp standard poor s 500 index during normal trading sessions and spy spdr sp 500 spy etf tracks sp i know what you will say that nerd who draws crayon lines is trying to sell me a newsletter for $23 a month for you probably that is a lot of money working your minimum wage job you don t need it i am a subscriber i find it very useful and educational adam provides supportresistance levels bear scenario bull scenario his trading plan and his strategy you are here in wsb to trade like adam you need a brain need to be disciplined need to be sophisticated need to be able to read price action need to be patient you are working at wendy s you are not a trader you are a gambler okay so his levels useless to me no mate please read the following for you to understand a support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level a resistance level is the opposite of a support level this means that there are more sellers than buyers it is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises again this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level a previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up and conversely a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back once an area or zone of support or resistance has been identified those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because as a price reaches a point of support or resistance it will do one of two thingsbounce back away from the support or resistance level trading ranges or violate the price level and continue in its direction trading breakouts until it hits the next support or resistance level the basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sellsell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold therefore consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area trading breakouts a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume the first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points once the asset trades beyond the price barrier volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout s direction breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases large price swings and in many circumstances major price trends when trading breakouts it is important to consider the underlying asset s support and resistance levels the more times an asset price has touched these areas the more valid these levels are and the more important they become at the same time the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to this doesn t happen all the time but when it does it is called a false breakout therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts markets regularly cycle between clean trend and choppy consolidation spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall usually after a large move in market a consolidation phase occurs after choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken everyone focuses on being smart but not being stupid is actually more important not being stupid is essential for survival do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance do not buy options when market consolidating buy calls when strong resistance shatters buy puts when strong support fails buy options during breakouts when market is trending i probably will regret this but i will answer any question regarding supportresistance levels not responsible for how you use this information your money your decisions lotto tickets 01 dte options only buying if breakouttrend exists buying calls above 3930 buying puts below 3840

finally made it out soxl x200b greetings nerds you might have seen my post a few weeks back where i went $50$125k on soxl i hit big on weeklies a few times during this run i let the december contracts go for a while but the constant rug pulls over the last few years scarred me and i closed the remainder of the position today it was anywhere from 400800 contracts of various strikes over the last few weeks x200b x200b as you can see i am not good at this been in the hole for nearly 5 years now the one time i was up was right before the covid circuit breakers evaporated my account in february 2020 this has been a pretty unpleasant experience that i do not intend to revisit i will not forget watching my friends buy shitty new ford focuses knowing that i couldn t afford it because i had dick for savings from pumping my paychecks into this trap and then you see all the loss porn posts with people saying you definitely have a gambling problem wondering if that might be you along these lines i am not sure i have any useful advice to offer i consider myself very lucky to be out with a reasonable all time profit i ve initiated a transfer for $100k to maintain an actual savings account and am going to sit the next few plays out don t care if any of you make fun of me or say see you next week i never blamed this sub for the times when i lost but with that said i also do not much of anything positive to say about it for a long time i thought this place had changed for the worse can t say the r word anymore etc but maybe i just grew more and more unhappy knowing how much money i had lost and having no idea how to get it back who knows for those of you who are here just trying to get your money back good luck

the hyperinflation tipping point the ukrainechina nexus one of the most stabilizing factors in the us economy has been the position of the us dollar as a reserve currency this has helped to buffer the dollar against wild swings no matter what shenanigans are going on in the actual economy why didn t the massive expansion of the money supply 2008 2020 devalue the dollar well largely because so many foreign powers who trade with the us have huge us currency reserves and selling off those reserves dumping us debt would make one of their biggest markets shrink like a frightened turtle the biggest of these is of course china but china is not just about trade in fact china is about power in recent years we ve seen china crush freedoms not just in china proper but notably in hong kong clawing back liberties that were guaranteed under the uk s exit the next gnat on the chinese back is taiwan the problem is that taiwan is even more independent than hong kong so regular conniving is not going to suffice to bring taiwan in line no the end game with taiwan is going to look a lot more like ukraine the ukraine fiasco has been an incredible real world test lab for china among the most crucial lessons has been that russia s efforts to insulate itself from foreign sanctions were far from sufficient but china is patient china has already been building up strong exus trading relationships trade routes raw materials suppliers political pawns for years as part of its power projection all that is left is to cut the umbilical cord of us debt that process has begun it s always seemed weird to me that the us federal reserve believes that they set the interest rates they do set their interest rates but only so long as the market players continue to show up at the trough the federal reserve auctions a set dollar value of debt to be auctioned at a set interest rate if there are not enough buyers for the debt ie because the return on investment interest rate isn t worth it then the auction fails failed auctions are very very scary they force something to happen either the federal reserve just buys its own debt yes that s a thing and it really is just printing money or the federal reserve is forced to raise interest rates i m going to repeat the key phrase the federal reserve is forced to raise interest rates when this happens it s time to go grab your coats because the game of charades specifically that the federal reserve sets interest rates is over at this point the dog starts wagging the tail and not the other way around in previous failed treasury auctions the fed just fired up the printers but in an era of 9 inflation and i dunno my gut is telling me that s a lowball estimate expanding the money supply is not going to be helpful tldr china has watched russia s economy be ruined by sanctions and has taken notes they have already started cutting us debt and this will start to impact treasury auctions when this happens the federal reserve will lose the ability to set interest rates still too longstill didn t read fukd

nobody knows nobody knows but one can have an opinion got bitten bad last week waiting for the market to return but nothing happened and for absolutely no reason it pumped today i think i know why so it can take a huge dump on wednesday once yellen tries to sell treasury bonds powell tries to play his double act and apple fails to provide good guidance on thursday i am not a bear but the fundamentals of this week are absolutely crap buying puts tomorrow and seeing spx 4 000 in the horizon goodluck

9722 spy es futures and apple daily market analysis the day of the bulls the day before father jpow speaks the day of i think everyone wanted a trend day but everyone wanted expected a bearish trend day not a bullish trend day if you were able to shake your bearish bias there was a lot of money to be made today the trend of green open red day and red open green day so far holds true one of the strongest 15min bull channels ive seen in a while while i am overall bearish still there is now a potential vbottom forming on the spy daily chart key support remains at 3919 for that recovery support line and key resistance for the downward red bear channel remains at 3982 tomorrow with only 2 1 green days in the last 16 trading days this is a much needed oversold bounce to reset the indicators and allow for the next leg down especially if you read my last night ta where i showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to cpi fomc we still have no cpi consensus if we break the red bear channel down i will get nervous about my 14dte puts however if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top i would not be as worried there is a nice setup to have a similar trend as august 25th 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow if markets are setting up similarly to the jackson hole where they rallied into jpow speaking only to dump like crazy intraday he speaks at 910am we could see a similar move tomorrow however there if of course always a chance we see a bigger bounce green and could retest 405 by eow one of the major bearish things is that the daily 8ema was not broken i think the correct thesis remains bearish as long as that daily 8ema holds as resistance key support remains 3919 and 3904 key resistance remains 3982 and 4052 spy weekly continues to hold that blue 13 week long recovery line despite futures apple breaking theirs we are still looking at a downward bear channel on the weekly which could give a potential bounce back to 4124 unlikely honestly this week another thing to keep an eye on is the current 3921 weekly candle double bottom that is attempting to form futures daily does not actually show the same vbottom recovery as spy it just shows a near support bounce off that 3883 area to retest daily 8ema resistance before the next leg down key support 3872 key resistance 3988 and 4000 futures weekly is also showing a possible weekly double bottom at 3923 forming if we were to not visit the lows before fridays market close weekly resistance for this bear channel is 4000 tomorrow with next weekly level resistance at 4025 weekly support is 3900 then 3828 apple continues to remain the wild child intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and spy with apple only putting in a 093 green day compared to spys 18 green day apple lagged most of the day i believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on spy hitting under 70mil currently with only 104 of the 30day average volume vs apple hitting 87mil and 127 of 30day average apple had a lot of sellers today i was looking to see if apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema however eod it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn t quite break down there we saw a pretty healthy rejection at 1565 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance key support 1555 daily 200ema 154 1522 key resistance 1565 1589 red bear channel apples weekly chart continues to remain bearish it shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down however we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 1595 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement key support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 i would be looking for 150 vix had a pretty large 844 sell off day today on this very green market day it still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s key level to watch tomorrow remains at 243 if that holds and they close it back over 255 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week i will be posting my cpi breakdown post later tonight if you read it you will see that i am overall bearish for friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to fomc is a big red week with previous fomc the only outlier i am still holding this put and i did average it down after closing bell today i still see a bigger sell off to come within the next two weeks most of it happening next week i do not have plans to average this down again tomorrow we get yet another jobs report and as i said jpow speaks at the cato institutes 40th annual monetary conference what is he going to say im not sure but if its anything like jackon hole the market is not going to like it with no cpi forecast still i still forsee a bearish tone from jpow there has not been a bullish fed member to speak in a very long time and finally markets are actually listening to what jpow is saying tomorrows opening is going to be spicy 10 challenge x200b overall a great day for me today took a loss on that put when i suspected we were going to see a sell off around 1215 when we broke then 15min 8ema other then that i didn t trade much after 1230 as while i clear saw the bull trend day and that it most likely after that 1215a bounce was not going to break i had a lot of trust in it and chose to just sit cash instead of trading something i had no conviction in youtube and cpi post will be up later tonight

how do options behave on 0dte days on large event days the title was too simple here s more of what i am asking on cpi and fomc days sometimes there are strong movement in one direction throughout the first few hours of trading often 930 am to 1200pm followed by a pullback and sometimes another rally here is an example how do options prices behave intraday during the pull back obviously the underlying stock is pulling back so a call in this case would be getting cheaper along with decrease in theta from 930 but does the pullback cause iv to move up leading to no significant decline in the price action of the option

i just realized i ve found the subconcious trick to being a succesful trader after losing thousands of dollars and an impressive number of losing plays when i deposit money to gamble i automatically assume its a loss but what i noticed after a quick spy put flip went right yesterday is if i gamble $200 sell em for $500 total i consider it $500 made i ve rewired my brain to think if i put it in my account its like lighting it on fire and anything i make back is profit like lighting hundred dollar bills on fire and then later that day finding $500 in a walmart parking lot lost $1000 on a biotech shit stock incorrect fuckface you made $300 cause now you have cash again the saying you only lose money when you sell is wrong you only make money when you sell and whatever that final number turns out to be is what you ve made you ll never lose money again if you adopt this schizo mindset as a defense mechanism you re welcome

build that wall the backroom of the bar theory the wall of wall street was built to create a backroom the north side is the front of the bar the south side is the backroom of the bar in true new york style the backroom is where the wall street boys shoot the sh and plot on how to manipulate the behemoth amount of capital on the table some things never change the wall was highly inconvenient for enemy armies and the poor those with practically zero assets were segregated from the financial world and it s masses of financial opportunities a second wall equates to double the cost double the investment not cool to me it s more like a border i look at it like the mother of all fences where the grass is greener on the south side the wall is gone wall street is the only wall that will exist forever
