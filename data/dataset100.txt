$mrvi dd i have 0 idea what this company does but after seeing the most suspicious insider trading post i have ever seen i decided to take a look thinks that mrvi is going to get acquired but doesn t know how options work or how to capitalize on it never traded options before somehow has a lot of conviction x200b put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 this is more important since it measures the number of contracts actually opened numbers from put call ratio is lopsided x200b average volume is around 2m but yesterday there was 6m volume and it went up a decent amount for no reason avg volume vs yesterday mrvi has been getting acquisition offers recently offer was at 42$ per share and was rejected when it was trading at 28$ per share recently there was another offer to buy them out earnings is next week and if there are any potential acquisitions i believe it might be announced around then with the ridiculously high amount of calls vs puts ending on aug 15 along with the unusual activity they are decently cheap if mrvi gets bought out at 42$ it would be trading at a 30$ premium compared to currently each option if bought atm could be 30x100 in profit positions 2x mrvi aug 19 125c 95date is different because i m in different timezone tldr mrvi put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 cheap play that could pay off with a lot of money possible acquisition announced soon edit some more interesting links i ve found biotechne tech exploring takeover of maravai lifesciences mrvi source

sri lanka pm says economy has collapsed unable to buy oil sri lanka s debtladen economy has collapsed after months of shortages of food fuel and electricity its prime minister told lawmakers wednesday in comments underscoring the country s dire situation as it seeks help from international lenders prime minister ranil wickremesinghe told parliament the south asian country is facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel gas electricity and food our economy has completely collapsed while sri lanka s crisis is considered its worst in recent memory wickremesinghe s assertion that the economy has collapsed did not cite any specific new developments it appeared intended to emphasize to his critics and opposition lawmakers that he has inherited a difficult task that can t be fixed quickly as the economy founders under the weight of heavy debts lost tourism revenue and other impacts from the pandemic as well as surging costs for commodities lawmakers of the country s two main opposition parties are boycotting parliament this week to protest against wickremesinghe who became prime minister just over a month ago and is also finance minister for not having delivered on his pledges to turn the economy around wickremesinghe said sri lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel even for cash due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation currently the ceylon petroleum corporation is $700 million in debt he told lawmakers as a result no country or organization in the world is willing to provide fuel to us they are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash he said wickremesinghe took office in may after days of violent protests over the country s economic crisis forced his predecessor to step down in his comments wednesday he blamed the previous government for failing to act in time to turn the situation around as sri lanka s foreign reserves dwindled the foreign currency crisis has crimped imports creating severe shortages of food fuel electricity and other essentials like medicines forcing people to stand in long lines to fulfill basic needs if steps had at least been taken to slow down the collapse of the economy at the beginning we would not be facing this difficult situation today but we lost out on this opportunity we are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom he said sri lanka has been muddling through mainly supported by $4 billion in credit lines from neighboring india but wickremesinghe said india would not be able to keep sri lanka afloat for too long it also has gotten pledges of $300 million$600 million from the world bank to buy medicine and other essential items sri lanka has already announced that it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year pending the outcome of negotiations with the international monetary fund on a rescue package it must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026 officials from international monetary fund are now visiting sri lanka to discuss a rescue package wickremesinghe said that a stafflevel agreement is likely to be reached by the end of july

wtf covered calls fellow regards i m extra special while i thought i understood how a covered call works and dove rite in head first i must ask how tf this is supposed to function first my possibly flawed understanding 1 buy 100 shares of company at 750 2 sell covered call contract for a strike price of $10 for september 3 stock shoots up over double strike price 4 my contract is triggered and some lucky regard gets to buy my shares at $10 even though they are trading at $25 that day 5 i keep the premium $150 and i get paid $10x100 now this happened with bbby using etrade the contract is still sitting there and i still own my 100 shares i thought once the stock went over strike the situation above would pan out forgive me for making what i thought was a smart play on bbby lol feel free to berate me for being extra regarded edit fixed spelling x200b x200b

weed stocks and etfs might be the move democrats seem to be gaining ground on republicans with hot topics like abortion and whether or not democracy is the vibe or not it is not a big brain move or anything but it seems fairly likely that if democrats gain enough power they ll streamline the process of nationwide legalization and weed stocks will reflect that some of you are angry at weed stocks because you bought high and are bag holders but you need to embrace the suck either they ll climb and you ll be free to lose you money on another stock or you ll have learned to suck hard enough for behind the wendy s dumpster i have positions in a weed etf that i won t name because it is less than a dollar per share at the moment as you were

frc is one to watch here is why this past week i did in fact open a position with frc i always try to keep a wellbalanced portfolio not all loaded into one industry or entity but frc has peaked my interest enough i have been willing to make an exception greater than 10 of my portfolio is now frc at the current price range these past few days of 12s 15s i see hints at accumulation by 1000s of accounts and the potential for positive news to really have an effect on the price compared to some of their regional counterparts they tend to have a long standing highly regarded brand that s key as with so many options out there you do want to align with brands you can respect they were unfairly beaten down a real guilty until proven innocent approach by investors the last 24 hours has brought at least some insight into this frc stock it has life its being talked about at the highest levels edit should ve used the correct spelling of peaked update in good spirits this monday morning

a beautiful short position in the making $pgr tldr progressive is somehow managing to lag the total market meltdown even though it has a balance sheet that holds no merit whatsoever for some reason puts are extremely cheap even though the company itself seems to be nosediving we all see the commercials everywhere i m sure but what if i told you that the company is in deep deep deep trouble you d probably ask me to show my work right that s a pretty big claim after all first thing s first here s a direct link to their sec 10q so you can verify this yourself for those who take my word for it here s what i m working with x200b net premiums vs net premiums earned net premiums written increased by 11 however net income decreased by 73 and total realized gains decreased by 161 in addition here s an excerpt from their explanation of financial results x200b this all seems like pretty bad news right you don t throw around negative 79 and 218 income values without the stock getting decimated well here s the stock valuation as of today now zoom out the stock should be getting absolutely hammered i m not sure what s going on here but i know that it has a long way down from its current valuation and right now the bets against it are cheap as always don t be an idiot do your own research only invest what you can afford to lose this is not a market environment that is intended to work with you i m not a professional investor but i ll be damned if i don t call opportunity when i see it

rily earnings today and implied move over 25 iv on options is over 500 very low volume today before earnings and shorts have started to cover as shares are now available again today it was sold down from over $50 a share to $15 3 days ago on allegations of fraud that has been cleared by a 3rd party audit fears of bankruptcy from this have been way overblown and earnings today should prove it edit average price $187 sold multiple calls to hedge earnings will look bad because of acquisitions im waiting to see if they keep a dividend then this should spike because it will just be that much more expensive to hold short if they buy back shares then it s primed for a squeeze edit heavily sold about 5 seconds after close no confirmation on buying back shares 10 dividend and no bankruptcy there s 11mil shares short and 5mil float so why do you think it sold off 20 5 seconds after the bell if you bought then sold covered calls to hedge then you aren t down 1520 dividend is still over 10 hold iv will still be extremely high so more calls can be sold to hedge more

we re in the true dawn of ev with all the news and spikes recently it can be easy to dismiss this as another quick run up but stepping back literally ev deliveries are universally up and beating expectations across almost every company while tsla had dominated and may continue to do so the next 35 years will provide millionaire making territory in probably a dozen ways whether cars or precious metals batteries or charging the entire sector is set to explode good explode what do you think are the most promising ev plays positions rivn shares tsla calls going into earnings
game of trends a feast for bears apple and tesla looking for cheaper hey everyone i wrote a post not too long ago talking about how we shouldn t fight the fed in the comments i describe the short positions that had been building against $tsla and $aapl i think a lot of you now understand why wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail s two favorite stocks now i am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we re seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports buckle up you probably want to both hear and not hear what i have to say inflation people are making decisions do i buy luxury brand or do i buy store brand so inflation the big iword it s been a disaster for the market a genie that should never have been let out of the bottle but it is and we re not done with it yet clearly there are a lot of signs emerging that it s affecting the consumer while it s not affecting the net spend from consumersyetit is affecting their choices take $wmt wmt saw a pretty good upswing in it s earnings last report with quite a good beat but why is this aren t things horrible for retail stores well if you think so you d be right but one person s loss is another person s gain when you re entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do you buy cheaper you go for store brand products instead of shopping at your local high end bashes grocery store or super target you hit up wal mart costco places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumershopper s dollar to the max this was our first big key to what s going on let s talk about the next the bullwhip effect x200b what the books say is happening this is how you get a glut of inventory bullwhip effect aka covid buy it all we re stuck at home we re seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market places are being flooded with inventory yes this is old news but it is also current news $tgt s last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives because stocks were so low places started to double triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting well it didn t last forever plus this didn t help x200b yeah that s your stuff out there ship congestion that s your stuff out there sitting for months this stuff sat on boats for freaking months you might say hey taytay86 i know all this crap why are you telling me old news because guess what it s here now that stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores but guess what it s freaking late like really late so what does a company like $tgt do well in their case they list on clearance it costs money to have this crap around plus if it sits too long it has to be completely written off you know red tag 8090 clearance aka please get it out of my store that gave $tgt a fat 45 cut in eps because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass if it takes too long they get shellacked here comes out next challenger nike $nke x200b here we go again our old friend mr highly engineered shoes guyz $nke reported after the bell today all eyes were definitely on them they ve been talking about this one all over the place so going in it s a hot topic well it s a pretty bad story there s a lot of similarities here i highly encourage you to listen to their entire call their margin s are compressed af 22 drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable 1 any time a ceocfo is throwing out catch phrases after every bad result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report i counted at least 45 times of we re still the super cool choice for shoes paraphrasing clearly 2 they suddenly have too much inventory sounds familiar it should that s why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours they are forecasting a repeat of what $tgt just had $nke may have squeaked by at 093 eps today but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes even worse than $tgt they sell season specific items this means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we re going into fall and winter yeah not a good situation it could potentially be worse than what $tgt just experienced combine that with the drop in profits and fx challenges you ve got a real problem 3 china revenue dropped i feel like that one didn t get the highlight it deserves the ceo kept trying to amp up that china is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell but yet their revenue there dropped 13 didn t they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options well apparently they aren t biting this is a very eerie warning why well let s start to summarize hopefully you re still reading x200b the cracking of apple the cracking of $aapl we ve had multiple warnings about china s demand for our multinational in the past few weeks let s list them out 1 fedex reported economic weakness in china if anyone knows how things are going it s the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling 2 nike is reporting weaker revenue from china where their stuff is basically made 3 apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 510 due to a lack of demand in places like you guessed it china now apple s debatable because there s some reports that the max is doing fine however i think that s probably a bullish dream their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first what s at fault honestly probably the chips and overall market nothing inside the phone is dramatically different it s a big nothing burger and there s not a lot of incentive to upgrade if you do want to you might as well shell out for the max to actually get something i believe this is going to result in a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar the upgrade is minor this is not a homerun for apple wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors but not in public that s why they ve been building short positions against apple x200b closing time closing out alright so let s close this baby out i know a lot won t read this but hey hope you do if you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $aapl this week so what s the trend we re seeing 1 there s too much stuff 2 luxuries are not the draw they once were things need to be noticeably different to get the $ 3 because of inflation people middle class are choosing to shop at cheaper locations 4 affordability is top of mind see carmax which i am not covering here so this is it this is all great for the battle against inflation but it s bad news bears for your stocks you re looking at potentially shaky eps results as we head into this earnings season and the next these are not single quarter problems inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system which brings me to what this means we re probably going lower in the market wall street is coming for retail they know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $aapl and $tsla as safety they are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do rumors are already leaking that $tsla could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons you ve got price and earnings to every pe ratio price has come down a lot but now we re going to look at e heading south there s two ways to skin a company let s talk about $tsla for a second x200b tesla is a cult the cult of tesla disclaimer 1 look i don t hide my feelings i greatly dislike tesla and their ceo elon musk i don t trust him i think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets 2 i think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws 3 i don t like cultish love for a human being elon has made a mistake that mistake making promises he doesn t keep there s 1 major promise that elon should have kept making an affordable ev i am not going to take you through the logic it s up above read this and you ll understand why i am pointing a finger here these cars are expensive and they don t offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does fsd costs extra these are luxuries what do we know about luxuries people are choosing to buy cheaper carmax directly said that affordability is on people s mind for car shopping now especially as interest rates soar making car financing way more expensive than it was a year ago i believe this is going to bite elon musk right in his lying manipulative ass his way out pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat this could happen soon or it could happen next year but it s coming for him keep in mind he s already tilted his hand calling austin and berlin s gigafactories cash burning machines just to add elon musk isn t your friend he doesn t care about you or your memes at all he s been the richest man on the planet he does not care about you he doesn t even live in the same world as you final words wall street is coming for apple wall street is coming for tesla they know you re holding it they are two massive giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy fat pair of piggy banks when it s all done the market is probably around 31003300 unless things get disorderly i expect these two to lead us lower because lets be honest not much else can these two have been holding the market up higher further disclaimer i have positions against aapl and tesla i ve been rolling them for a while i won t share my exits but here s proof that i am in what i say i am i started these with 3k going strong so far good luck out there this is not an endorsement for you to copy me i trade very actively and move very fluidly contact a professional if you want real financial advice i am an amateur and this is my own take on the market i am not responsible for whatever you choose to do be safe x200b follow up question why 100$ strike apple typically loses 4050 peak to trough in major

aegon ltd why i m going long on this company due diligence normal disclaimers not financial advice posting for educational purposes do your own research i just like the stock x200b x200b why i am long on aegon ltd x200b the all time high for aegon aeg is 6256 per share in january of 1999 so what happened in the 90s causing this price increase and subsequent dropoff dutch insurer acquires transamerica in $97 billion deal x200b the stock lost a significant amount of value over the next several years following this purchase and again lost even more value after shares were issued to the dutch state in 2008 to help weather the economic storm there was a slight price increase after aegon completes repayment to dutch state but then the price topped out at 950 per share in 2013 before dropping to a low of 180 in march 2020 x200b in january this year the company announced plans to repurchase shares for sharebased compensation plans for senior management in august this year ceo lard friese stated that transamerica performed well new life sales increased by 17 compared with the previous year driven by another strong increase in the number of world financial group wfg agents now at a recordhigh of 70 000 written sales of midsized retirement plans increased almost 70 driven largely by a pooled plan sale of usd 17 billion x200b according to this article from 2021 wfg only had 50 000 agents in 2021 that means they have seen a 40 increase in the number of independent licensed agents working with them since the shift to remote work this has resulted in the company expecting operating capital generation from its units to be around 12 billion euros $130 billion this year versus a prior target of more than 1 billion the prior target of 12 billion was not projected until 2025 meaning they are growing much more than they had anticipated also in november of 2022 transamerica appointed todd buchanan president of world financial group and head of transamerica financial advisors who brings more than 25 years of expertise in insurance distribution digital transformation retirement and wealth management leadership to his new roles so all of these factors along with their ability to now offer stock options to senior management of their rapidly expanding field force in the near future i see aegon s price rising a lot over the next several years x200b aeg is up 1476 as of this writing over the past year and 2006 in just the last 6 months x200b when i began looking into this a couple weeks ago the furthest expiration options available were for july 19 2024 and you could get a 75 call for $5 bucks x200b i picked up some of them and they ve already tripled in value but from everything i m seeing on this company i plan to keep buying more calls as they become available x200b tldr stonk going up super cheap calls currently available
