the fall of cannabiz i m not sure when to get in but i think cannabis stocks are going to plummet with a gop win in the house tomorrow and that is almost a certainty dems squandered their majority so who knows when federal legalization will be viable again two years six years ten years those timelines aren t unrealistic and unless republicans come up with some legislation that allows use of bank cards for purchase of marijuana in legalized states it will be difficult for the cannabiz to fully blossom

this could be unpopular here but has the extinction of trade fees led to the least efficient market ever i keep seeing stuff everywhere from people who think they re smart and well regarded about how nothing makes sense credit card debt balances hits all time high after the highest credit card balance decrease ever in covid and simultaneously the market is at an all time high and employment an all time low i thought of this when i saw a fee on my uber eats and made me think about how i can buy so many securities all over the world for no fee but i have to pay a fee on so many other things there is no barrier to entry and there s lots of people who think they can get rich quick including myself

how institutions take advantage of clueless retail featuring bbai in the last couple weeks there have been a lot of posts about squeeze s for the most part all of these have been pd s that have been promoted by people who have jumped into them to try to make some quick money one of them however is particularly stupid people have been promoting bbai saying that it has a low float and the cost to borrow is about 800 as a result the stock has gone up about 100 in a month and some people think it s going to moon there is one serious flaw with the bbai thesis if you actually read the 10k and s1 forms you notice that the company has $200 million of convertible debt this debt can be converted to shares at a price of $1150 taking into account the value of the imbedded warrants in the debt it makes sense for institutions to convert the debt into shares at about $13 a share if all the debt is converted at $13 a share institutions will make about $26 million in profit so retail being stupid has pushed the price up to $1250 a share not understanding that there is a $226 million sell wall at about $13 retail has created a trade in which buying a share of bbai gives almost no upside while carrying tons of downside retail then proceeds to promote this trade if any major volume comes in at $13 a share or higher institutions will dump bbai shares on retail and retail will be stuck holding the bag in order for the price to go above $13 a share retail would need to buy $226 million in shares and continue buying that is not going to happen positions shorting bbai is expensive so i instead sold 100 1216 $5 calls this stock can t go up above about $13 a share at least not with any serious volume the company recently reported terrible earnings so positive catalysts that would drive the price above $13 a share are unlikely before this stock was meme d it traded at $5 a share also 100m insider shares get unlocked on december 7th or if the price closes above $1250 for 20 out of 30 trading days edit it has been pointed out in the comments that the s1 that was filed for the convertible debt is not effective yet hence the debt cannot be converted it was filed 2 weeks ago so it should become effective any day now so trade bbai at your own risk i will maintain my position as it is i think the riskreward is still heavily in my favor

elon musk took down my portfolio x200b x200b i started trading back in july 2022 hoping to make gains and improve my life about 3 months later i learned about option contracts this was when things got interesting at first i played it safe nothing over 1k my gains and losses were at about the same rate tired of the lack of progress i searched the internet for the best companies to invest in this lead me to companies with the highest volumes one company in particular caught my eyes as it did with many others tsla x200b tesla stock has been on a decline since the beginning of the year it s value dropped by almost 50 at the time my bullish instinct told me to buy unaware that elon musk would be selling over $3 billion worth of stocks that same week x200b i bought calls for strike price of $180 with expiration of dec 16 this was the beginning of the most painful week in my trading experience so far at the end of monday the stock price had dropped by over $10 still bullish i bought more calls at strike price of $170 instead of cutting my losses all while elon musk was selling off billions on tuesday i was still hopeful that the price would recover but the fall continued wednesday night was when the news came out about elon s sell off all hopes was lost x200b looking back at my decisions i realize the signs were there but i refused to listen the loss that i sustained wasn t major compared to many other people but it was over 90 of my account i m not angry with elon musk it just hurts knowing that the owner of the company i was rooting for contributed to the down fall of my portfolio x200b if anyone wants to share some gains with me or donate to help me get back in the game please send me a message anything would be greatly appreciated
powell will powell the economy bond etfs for part 1 my ass is sore from jerome powell interest rates are sky high i can t afford shit jerome powell has been fucking my wife and her boyfriend because i can t provide for their needs he has also been powelling my wallet and the economy with his large swinging dick of interest rate policy to ward off inflation to be fair its not working because my dick gets inflated every time i see this sexy ass man i don t think this is sustainable and a recession is looming for example other regards seem to think the economy isn t too hot as seen in the michigan consumer sentiment index part 2 what the fuck is a tlt in an attempt to get unbroke i got my hands on a bloomberg terminal called robinhoodcom and i found this stock called tlt this tracks long term bond prices and bond prices are inversely correlated with bond yields that is to say if one goes up the other goes tits up it is also important to note that there are other etfs that track shorter maturity bonds like $shy for example but they would be less sensitive to changes in interest rates in the interest of antirisk tolerance i opted for an etf that tracks longer maturity bonds as it would be more sensitive to changes one can reasonably do call options also instead of long stock but i think that in vegas when you lose a shit ton of money at least you get comped a nice room instead of having to hear jerome powell take your wife to pound town in the next room over of your one story house part 3 why i think bond yields are going down as a regard apart from consumer sentiment there is this thing called the yield curve which is currently inverted that is the position my wife enjoys the most with jerome powell every time the yield curve has inverted in the past 50 years a recession has followed this is all the proof i need if a recession was to occur interest rates would have to come down which means bond yields would have to come down and thus bond prices would go up also the federal reserve would have to buy bonds further increasing bond prices conclusion i m on my shit in conclusion am i yes will this work depends on if jerome powell accepts venmo from regards can this go tits up absolutely not disclaimer not financial advice x200b yield curve inversion 102 spread consumer sentiment index sources

the heist of the dollar after studying for a few years on the fed central banks and the founding fathers of the united states i ve slowly connected and traced back the origin of the fed and the start of the heist on the us dollar it s started in full force somewhere around 1910 but let s keep going further we can trace that farther back to 1832 when president andrew jackson vetoed the second central bank of the us seems like he tried to put up a fight but outside consultants already had infiltrated andrew jackson said this in 1832 every monopoly and all exclusive privileges are granted at the expense of the public which ought to receive a fair equivalent the many millions which this act proposes to bestow on the stockholders of the existing bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earnings of the american people this means the bank act would put the debt of the wealthy on the backs of the public edit omfg i think we lost to the chinese look at this trench i just found the carlyle group ceo kewsong lee forgot to add he won this position over an american businessman who was once a virginia governoryea he went to choate rosemary hall a very prestigious boarding school for american political figures jerome powell was a partner with the company carlyle group and who was powell preceded by as a member of the federal reserve board of governors rick mishkins guess who gave mishkins an honorary professorship peoples university of china we have been infiltrated edit 2 shit just keeps going huh jerome powell partner of carlyle group in 1980s also worked at dillon read co which was founded in 1832 from a small brokerage firm called carpenter vermilye how did they make their billions selling war bonds during the us civil war now thats one company that spawned another company that spawned people that teach more people the ways of the dark side shits fascinating keep going edit 3 i kept going john f kennedy signs executive order 11110 this effectively stripped the feds power to release currency he believed the currency should be created by the treasury of the us and not a private federal reserve this order passed and about $4 billion was printed in $1 and $5 denominations before we know what happens next within this framework the federal reserve has established itsnetwork of swap agreements as has been widely recognized these arrangements have provided an important supplemental source of international liquidity available both to the united states and to the other participating countries the federal reserve page 3 of their letter on swap arrangements october 1963 the british are cumming the mole may have been alexander hamilton in 1791 he said himself he literally copied and pasted the bank of england as the basis for the central bank thomas jefferson opposed this idea but it was passed still jefferson feared this would create a monopoly over banks to favor certain creditors and debtors they started with $10 million the germans are also cumming john jacob astor one of 6 men to finance and invest in the second bank of the united states he is known as the first multi millionaire investor in the us born in germany made tens of millions by taking advantage of the 1794 jay treaty which allowed him to rival big trade names between great britain and the us he made tens of millions by smuggling 10 tons yes tons of ottoman produced opium in 1816 if you re lost in our story the fed was trojan horsed by foreigners who financed the central bank with drug money from ottoman empire produced opium

$3k to $30k today today was an intense trading day for me yesterday i opened 60 vfs sept 15 203050 iron butterflies with a spread of 20 robinhood filled me between 199 and 1999 which theoretically meant almost zero risk with the iv already high i thought things couldn t get worse however overnight i was assigned against 11 of my short 30 calls despite this i remained optimistic about the trade i believed my loss was negligible and was confident the iv would decrease i was under the impression that regardless of the stock price movement i wouldn t lose money but then iv shot up to a whopping 398 in the morning the iron butterflies i had sold for 1999 now required 225 to close as a result i faced a margin call and saw my account value plummet to 3k i had to liquidate most of my long calls including those in spy nflx and nvda luckily by the afternoon vfs began to dip and the iv also started to drop i managed to close all of them at around 165 the major takeaway from today never short itm calls i had never been assigned early on robinhood and mistakenly believed i had more time my account finally settled at 30k by day s end it was hands down the most nervewracking trading day i ve ever faced and i hope not to experience such tension again
after the banking crisis what s next for the $8 trillion mbs market mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked security mbs have long been considered almost as safe a market as us debt but the recent banking turmoil is stirring up fears in this $8 trillion market x200b before the collapse of silicon valley bank agency mortgagebacked securities agency mortgagebacked security agency mbs was one of its largest investments and now that the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has taken over silicon valley bank investors expect these bonds to be sold off in the coming months further depressing mbs prices x200b at one point the spread between agency mbs and corresponding us bonds rose 20 basis points after the run on silicon valley bank according to factset data x200b after the small bank run there are fears that more regional banks will be forced to sell their bond holdings mediumsized banks hold far more agency mbs than small banks and if they choose to sell because they are facing a run this will inevitably have a more violent impact on the mbs market x200b paul varunok a mortgage bond portfolio manager at investment house franklin templeton said the market is deep enough to absorb or even liquidate a lot of these sold securities as lower valuations attract new buyers but any further turmoil in the banking sector could trigger more violent market volatility x200b rate hikes hit mbs hard indirectly leading to the collapse of silicon valley bank agency mbs backed by mortgages from stateowned banks fannie mae and freddie mac are widely held by banks insurance companies and bond funds x200b this type of bond is much less likely to default than most debt and is highly liquid which is a key reason why it is favored by silicon valley banks x200b however agency mbs like all longterm bonds are vulnerable to rising interest rates when the federal reserve opened a storm of interest rate hikes last year their prices were significantly depressed and caused banks such as silicon valley bank to suffer flotation losses x200b for example the price of low interest agency mbs began to fall about a year ago x200b according to factset data some bonds fell 15 or more in a few months trading as low as 80 cents on the dollar x200b during the downturn fund managers who had to mark their investments to market sold a lot of lowcoupon mbs at a loss but banks largely held on classifying much of their debt as heldtomaturity bonds and marking it up above market prices x200b but this strategy backfired on silicon valley bank as massive withdrawals by customers forced it to sell securities at a loss further triggering a run on the bank that eventually forced it to declare bankruptcy x200b a repeat of the 08 crisis which midsized bank was the first to roll over as of dec 31 last year silicon valley bank held about $78 billion in institutional mbs and the small bank signature bank which was just acquired and first republic bank frcn$ whose stock market crashed had far less than that x200b but the real concern is that larger banks may roll over next x200b now bank analysts and mbs investors are investigating the assets of other midsized banks and they worry that depositors will also lose confidence in midsized banks x200b t rowe price group inc s mortgage bond portfolio experience ramon de castro said x200b we immediately went to look at their assets 2008 the script of the great financial crisis could be back among midsize us financial institutions carlson financial truist financial and us hopewell bank are the largest holders of institutional mbs according to filings with the securities and exchange commission sec of these us investment brokerage giant credit suisse has the largest share with $237 billion in agency mbs x200b these firms claim to have enough capital to cope with withdrawals as a spokesperson for credit suisse previously stated x200b given the significant liquidity resources available to us the likelihood that we will need to sell our portfolio before maturity is virtually nil but investor confidence has not improved significantly with credit suisse shares having fallen nearly 28 percent since the beginning of march and shares of two other companies also plunging x200b ankur mehta global head of securitized products research at citigroup said the current portfolio size is too large and any adjustment would hurt the price of lowyield bonds held by most banks though measures taken by us regulators would prevent a selloff x200b the federal reserve s lending tools and other initiatives will prevent banks from making any mandatory selloffs according to a previous wall street journal article midsized us banks have asked regulators to extend fdic insurance to all deposits over the next two years to avoid a crisis at small banks that could lead to a larger bank run
i want to invest in these tech stocks once things calm down block pinterest and zoom they re all highlyeffective services that have interesting network effects that call for change in how things are done block seeks to empower underbanked users with useful financial services and research into new systems like corn coin pinterest is a social media platform built around ideas and planning that is now naturally pivoting toward shopping in an era that s long seeking alternatives from facebook and amazon services and seeing shifts in shopping preferences like shein or tiktok s recommendations zoom is a large element on why hybrid work is possible at scale by building a reliable videofirst cloud infrastructure and product x200b there are other groundbreaking softwares out there but i feel like these services all achieve high economic throughput and the ability to upgrade industries to better fit the needs of their consumers there s a common argument against companies like these believing that there is no moat or treating the market like it s zero sum but i believe that the growth of things like apple and microsoft informs the growth of things like google facebook and amazon and so on the existence of google facebook and amazon will allow companies like pinterest zoom and other child competitors to grow and develop their own markets it appears that next generation technology seems to be occupied by developing for experiences and not just digital consumption what do you think of these three companies
job data inflation a few regarded notes sorry for my poor english 1 being an employer i don t understand why was the new job openings data so underestimated for january companies tend to time the opening of new positions and filling vacancies for the start of the year i don t say that the whole surprise results from this but this is an important factor 2 the contradiction between high rates easing inflation but strong job data leads me to the conclusion that inflation is to the supply chain driven to a mauch larger extent than many thought it is 3 the market is mainly focused on us rates and does not to seem to pricing in the easing supply chain situation the effect of supply chain disruption and its recovery is underestimated with china reopening and with the global supply chain adjusting to the long lasting war inflation will go down maybe quicker as we thought

a retard s view on why we are due for a prolonged bear market forget china and forget the war in ukraine you americans are to thank for the bear market 1 inflation is still going up and is now spreading to other sectors such as services there are more job openings than job seekers so workers can bargain for higher wages causing a wageprice inflation spiral between these two factors inflation looks like its going to be baked in 2 the last time inflation was at current levels was in the 70s and early 80s btw an infamously shit time for the stock market at which time interest rates were 10 now we are at under 2 so money is still cheap as fuck and the fed is not moving anywhere near fast enough x200b us inflation x200b us interest rates 3 to get a grip on inflation the fed is going to have to raise interest rates faster than planned and the rule of thumb is when interest rates rise stock markets fall 4 since the fed overshot a sharp rise in interest rates will engineer a recession which paired with high inflation means consumers will tighten their belts leading to worse company performance and some people needing to pull out of their savings sell shares to make ends meet market sentiment will fall 5 the market had massive stimulus from qe stimulus checks and lockdowns where we had nothing to spend our money on the party is now over and its time for the hangover market sentiment will fall further 6 quantitative tightening will reduce market sentiments even further and soon the boomers will start pulling out their money and retire further reducing sentiment and then after that the retards will pull out their money as the final dip is about to come market sentiments by this point will be somewhere below the earth s crust this is when to buy back and the moment is still a long way off until we get inflation under control and the recession starts it takes no balls to hold as holding means you dont have to do anything it takes balls to sell and i ve sold retards piping hot regards beargang

summary of closing arguments from spiritjetblue vs doj case law360 boston december 5 2023 244 pm est while hearing closing arguments in a monthlong bench trial a massachusetts federal judge weighed tuesday whether he could strike a balance between permanently barring a proposed $38 billion merger between jetblue airways corp and spirit airlines and letting the deal go through as is during more than two hours of arguments in the closely watched case us district judge william g young peppered both sides with questions about what an outcome might look like that allows the deal to go forward but with additional divestitures that might help buoy the market for bargainhunting fliers who would be harmed if spirit ceased to exist the us department of justice and several states sued to stop the merger arguing it would harm competition by removing a socalled ultralowcost carrier and cost consumers billions of dollars through higher fares and fewer seats on planes the airlines have countered that a merger like this is the only way spirit can survive and the only way to compete with the big four carriers that dominate the market united american delta and southwest jetblue attorney ryan shores of cleary gottlieb steen hamilton llp said during his closing argument that the company has agreed to significant divestitures to help out other ulccs and allow them to enter markets currently served by spirit my question is accepting all that what if i were to say these are fine but we need a little more judge young said asking if he should hold further hearings on the potential remedy you absolutely can your honor shores replied and my question is should i the judge asked as opposed to a fullstop injunction the court should hold a remedy hearing if it determines there is any harm from this merger which we of course deny the attorney responded judge young had floated the notion of ordering unspecified additional divestitures at various points during the trial which drew crowded galleries and a lineup of airline industry bigwigs at various points jetblue s ceo testified that the big airlines have no reason to sweat his company s deal with spirit and a united executive told the judge his airline would aggressively target budgetconscious fliers judge young also heard from spirit s board chair who said there were no profits on the horizon for the bargain carrier and the merger is needed tuesday s closing arguments which at times seemed more like appellate oral arguments with the judge s frequent questions and interjections drew an audience so large that nearly two dozen people stood behind the packed benches and two dozen more occupied an overflow courtroom two floors below when asked by the judge about the prospect of additional divestitures to sweeten the deal from the government s perspective doj attorney edward duffy said he could not imagine anything that would make up for spirit exiting the marketplace looking at the nature of the harm it is difficult for me to envision what type of remedies could offset this you re talking about a significant reduction in capacity a loss of a ulcc competitor duffy said the extent of the harm we discussed there does not seem to be a remedy other than a fullstop injunction that would restore competition but judge young said he was struggling with whether a permanent block on the deal made sense in what it seems quite clear to this court is a dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in this postcovid environment don t you think i ought to build in some future review or way to see if whatever determinations i make here can be rethought if my assumptions are incorrect judge young asked duffy the attorney said the deal cannot exist in its present form and under the current and foreseeable market conditions this is a softball question this question jumps to the end and presumes the government prevails here i am having trouble with a permanent injunction judge young replied maybe a permanent injunction is too restrictive that s what i am suggesting what sort of limitations should i put on it the injunction would be limited to the deal in front of the court duffy said another deal would be another case judge young replied drawing an echoed response from duffy judge young cautioned both sides before the start of the twohour hearing and the packed gallery that his questions should not be taken as an indication that he had made up his mind one way or the other further briefing in the case is expected on dec 13 while the doj s track record in recent antitrust proceedings has been mixed the government did score a victory in a similar trial last year seeking to block jetblue from forming a partnership in the northeast with american the two airlines gave up on the deal after the trial setback in making his final oral pitch to judge young shores argued that four weeks of trial 90 exhibits and 22 witnesses have not changed the fact that the big four hold 80 of the airline market and that this deal would not alter that power balance the competitive landscape fundamentally shifted years ago in favor of the dominant carriers shores said that is why jetblue began considering a merger with spirit with one main goal to create a viable disruptive national challenger to the industry s dominant airlines that mandate is even more urgent today shores said the divestitures that are already part of the deal including coveted slots at airports like laguardia in new york city are going to turbocharge other ulccs like allegiant and frontier whose ceo testified during the trial that he envisioned a frenzy of competition to replace spirit but the doj s duffy said that the fliers who would be hurt the most are those who rely on spirit as a bargain alternative counting on other ulccs to fill the void requires making assumptions that are simply staggering he said the court would have to believe that ulccs would have to grow faster than they ever have before that they would take on legacy airlines in a way that they never have before and that they would fly to places at odds with their established business models he said perhaps they view that harm to those least able to bear it as just the cost of doing business but that s not the law in america duffy continued this transaction is a bad deal for consumers the government is represented by edward w duffy james l moore iii john m briggs aaron m teitelbaum arianna markel sarah v riblet john r thornburgh ii john dimarco and garrett windle of the us department of justice s antitrust division the states and dc are represented by their respective attorneys general read more at

could the fed hike 50 bps in march here s what morgan stanley says would need to happen summary of the feb 3 ms research note highlighting revisions to fed policy projections the recent payroll data revisions have caused a shift in the baseline forecast for the march fomc meeting from a pause to a 25bp hike the revisions also raise the probabilities for a wide range of policy outcomes including an increase in the magnitude of hikes an extension of hiking and the possibility of the next move being up after a fed pause the updated data shows that if the pace of job gains from january is sustained a 50bp hike may be firmly on the table for debate the fomc statement shifted the focus from the pace of increases to the extent of increases and chair powell suggested that the march summary of economic projections could include a lower path for rates the incoming data releases including jobs and inflation prints will provide important information on the extent and pace of the fed s tightening path the february payroll report is expected to show net job gains of 200k and a repeat of a 500k jobs print could lead to a 50bp hike as early as the march meeting the labor market may see more resilience which could extend the tightening cycle the underlying demand dynamics point to a slowdown in jobs and the recent job gains are likely to be a oneoff and not inflecting upwards tldr could see 50bps hike in mar if next nfp is jan repeat massive beat

listen here you potato faced regards 1 first of all if rc doesn t tweet tonight and the price continues to drop he could be found in violation of the fiduciary responsibilities he took on after his march purchases which included multiple board seats he could face massive finespenalties lawsuits or even prison time 2 rc did not sell we know that now the fact that the market is not responding to that information leads me to believe that there sell of is a mixture of scared paper hands retards who cant read and computers that also cant read 3 look at the charts ah after the initial selloff it s a perfectly calculated buysell in a sequential wave with almost zero volume low volume computers pretty little patterns 4 the people who really control the price don t have bloomberg terminals so the only market movers ah are computers circle jerking 5 rc cannot sell off his assets or options for another 30 days by law 6 if he were to sell today his options are so otm that he would barely profit why would he do that and then face finespenalties etc 7 my call is $40 by eow 8 rc is likely not tweeting because he is concerned about sec scrutiny that would come from any kind of social media post see elon musk vs sec on tsla 9 these wsb regards need to be a little less regarded and practice their 3rd grade reading skills 10 wsb will be filled with panic sellers crying about how they jumped ship $18 after bbby hits 30 35 40 11 lastly the real killer of bbby shares is fucking retards setting stop losses on every single account these fuckers have fomo and paper hands simultaneously when there is a panic sell that is a signal to buy not sell 12 rant over see you tomorrow rocket rocket gem gem
discussion hello everyone my first post here to anyone unaware supermicro computer inc smci has recently tanked 10 despite it having significant growth potential in my opinion this drop follows an analysis from spruce point capital that have taken a short position on the asset i personally believe this is an overreaction and smci is well poised to capitalise on projected growth in the server and electronic hardware market i believe that whether you agree with spruce point or not there is potential to profit here smci has historically outperformed earnings expectations by a relatively significant margin there is essentially a lot riding on these earnings i believe that positive earnings will likely provide a catalyst for the share price of smci to reflect its growth potential much higher than is implied by current price in my opinion whilst a negative earnings report will likely fortify the bearish sentiment that resulted from spruce point s report and cause a further selloff if you like me believe smci has growth potential disproportionate to its share price i recommend the following my strategy to take advantage of the smci s value given the timing of earnings coming up at the end of the month would be to sell credit spreads on smci prior to earnings to capitalise on potential iv crush i encourage you to read up on spruce point s analysis and make your mind up if you agree that smci is threatened sell call spreads if you believe spruce point have missed something sell put spreads regardless ensure they have an expiry date relatively far into the future this way if earnings move in your favour you profit through both iv crush decreasing the value of your sold spread and the spread moving out of the money furthermore if earnings move against you iv crush s effect on the value of your sold spread with soften the blow of your position moving against you you additionally have more time for your position to move into the money regardless of your sentiment on smci please let me know if i have missed anything

attention spans and market crashes 2022 edition thesis as technology has evolved we as a society have become more and more reliant on instant gratification whether it be getting that butt plug from amazon in less than 24 hours or having someone else drive to the restaurant 5 minutes down the street from your apartment instead of doing it yourself and waiting in line we now live in a time of instant gratification i believe this has had an effect on our attention spans as far as how long we are willing to wait for something to happen now how does this relate to the markets well first it means whenever a crash does happen wether that happens in this recession or not we now think in a completely different manner than we did in any other crash waiting 5 minutes for things to happen seems like a lifetime to us i think we are seeing that play out in the market right now if you look at the sp500 for the last year the market will go down for about a month then the next month go back up almost to the same high but not quiet as high all before going down for another month i believe that what is happening is this instant gratification impulse is changing the market dynamics in that we aren t going to wait for a crash from what i can see it appears that we re giving a coming crash about a month then when it doesn t happen in that short time frame we collectively go nah that s not going to happen it would have already done it we ll see how it continues to play out but i do think there is something to this

2024 prediction as requested wow my 2023 prediction post really blew up see here i have had zero social media ever except here so seeing 10k upvotes is wild lol i genuinely like coming in here to read and talk sht with you all yall rock love this place i will try to answer a few requests no i did not get rich from this trade made great money on the trade but not life changing super grateful i did stick to the trade genuinely saw it shifting and even told private group text chat about it like i did here no discord or public chat room i am self taught and have traded for about 19 years now fair warning i m very direct ok idiots for 2024 so you are all still rather bearish with your double top talk and the media has been more bullish lately the big money stole your shares when spy was 355410ish theyre not selling those and you want a crash to rebuy them so big money is already winning and gives zero fcks they want to pump this beast and so does team blue imagine going on campaign saying the market is at historic highs anyways all that is bullish then we have had 2 major wars begin gold breaking out rate hikes job layoffs literally everywhere in multiple waves and rampant inflation lets not forget the sell pressure from qt all year yet after all of this the indexes are at or near ath fcking wild yes indeed so that means its all been digested and yet the market still doesnt give af the good data from a month or two ago had an amazing reaction where indexes ran 23 in a few days so any good news seems to cause more gains whereas bad news may not cause more losses as demonstrated through 2023 while we went up also even more bullish as rates are going to go down and qt ends in mid 2024 to alleviate some sell pressure bulls are very thirsty as you can somewhat see in the recent bitcoin rally and price reaction of equities to any good data mofo s still be hunting for that yield and so stocks want their btc movement too you re all going to again be wondering why how and what the hell is going on while indexes eventually grind higher for the year for 2024 i think spy will hit 505 possibly up to 519

zm earnings today what s in the cards zoom video communications zm will be releasing their stuff today so we get to see how they ve fared this recent quarter wall street expect them to report earnings per share of $108 revenue of $112 billion a slight increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $110 billion zoom s forecast for the january 2024 fiscal year calls for revenue of between $4485 billion and $4495 billion up 2 with adjusted profits of $463 to $467 a share consensus estimates call for revenue of $4492 billion and earnings of $468 a share with the coronavirus emergency over the company s share price has been on a rollercoaster lads we re talking cutthroat competition and growth hitting the brakes but here s the kicker zoom s gotta level up in the corporate jungle if it wants to keep its revenue game strong the company has been seeking to grow by moving beyond its flagship web meeting service it has added software for contact centers webinars chat and email plus new artificial intelligence ai tools among other things but growth remains slow the stock has retreated 5 so far this year with the nasdaq shooting up 36 amid buzz over generative ai technology today zoom is likely to post its sixthstraight quarter of singledigit revenue growth but on the plus side zoom video has about $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet they re sitting on a treasure chest boys and with this we should expect more acquisitions in a research note previewing the quarter morgan stanley analyst meta marshall dropped some knowledge in a research note the stock isn t likely to move much until investors feel more confident about the company s online business the smaller customers who flocked to the platform during the pandemic marshall s playing it chill with an equal weight on zoom another key question marshall mentioned is when some of zoom s fresh toys might spur a reacceleration in the company s enterprise business and she also wonders when zoom might use its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions as mentioned earlier zoom has $6 billion in cash and shortterm investments equal to about 31 of its market capitalization important factors zoom s fiscal thirdquarter performance is likely to have gained from steady demand for products like zoom video webinars zoom rooms and zoom phones an expanding portfolio of solutions is expected to have aided customer growth in this soonreported quarter the company s ai related advancements and partnerships in the fiscal third quarter are noteworthy zoom adopts a federated approach to ai utilizing its own exclusive largelanguage ai models as well as models from renowned ai companies like openai and anthropic in the tobereported quarter zm threw down its generative ai digital assistant into the mix rather than increase revenue zoom video expects ai tools to retain customers at its annual zoomtopia user conference in early october the company said it will not charge customers for use of its ai companion that s right they dished it out free for the zoomers with paid accounts talk about a power move this is totally expected to be a key growth driver its capabilities include meetingchat summaries and smart recordings in this conference the company announced new platform innovations that leverage robust ai capabilities aimed at simplifying the workday by providing efficient communication and collaboration tools zoom video is racing to build more artificial intelligence tools into its business communications platform zoom video recently backed off from a change in its terms of service for platform users that would have enabled it to gather data to train ai models set for release in 2024 docs is an aipowered workspace that can be used for documentation project tracking and management tasks meanwhile recently told its employees to report to its offices on a more regular basis amid covid19 emergency demand for zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home also zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as making video calls became routine for consumers to keep in touch with family and friends remote learning and needs in telemedicine also boosted demand for zoom video s cloudbased services the availability of zoom clips which allows users to easily record edit and share highfidelity shortform video messages both internally and externally is likely to have aided enterprise customer growth in the tobereported quarter the company also announced the launch of notes a fresh workspace designed for creating and collaborating both before during and after meetings zoom video aims to integrate ai into more products at the enterprise connect conference in march zoom video announced the expansion of a workplace collaboration platform called zoom iq it summarizes chat threads organizes ideas drafts content for chats emails and whiteboard sessions and creates meeting agendas in may zoom announced an investment in ai startup anthropic to support research roadmaps anthropic s ai model will be integrated into zoom s contact center platform zoom video in july rolled out zoom workforce management which improves agent productivity by automatingoptimizing agent work shifts and monitoring agent performance the consensus estimate for enterprise customers in the fiscal third quarter is currently pegged at 221 336 one key to zoom s success has been a freemium business model zoom s basic videocalling package is free they put a limit on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings zoom software gets high ratings for ease of use and simplicity following earlier video services that provided jerky images and outofsync audio the company s freemium business model helps it win customers rapidly whom it can later convert into paying customers in the fiscal second quarter customers contributing more than $100 000 in revenues in the trailing 12 months grew 178 to 3 672 these customers accounted for 29 of revenues up from 26 in the yearago quarter the momentum is expected to have continued in the tobereported quarter the number most likely well above 3 700 now a zoom meeting refers to a videoconferencing session hosted on its cloud infrastructure paid zoom business plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats zoom phone a cloudcalling product rolled out in 2019 lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video the zoom phone replaces traditional business pbx phone systems zoom reached 55 million paid phone seats at the end of 2023 up over 100 yearoveryear said baird s power the company expects that to become a 10 revenue segment early this year and perhaps as high as 25 in the future however the company has been facing significant competition from the likes of cisco microsoft and google meet this might have led to a loss in small and mediumsized business customers which is likely to have hurt topline growth but let s talk competition specifically with microsoft sales growth slowed for the ninthstraight quarter as the company adjusts to slower product demand in the postcoronavirus emergency era see i m left wondering when decelerating sales will hit a bottom zoom s cloudbased software sets up video calls with chat tools available also customers can easily share content microsoft and its teams communications tools are pretty much offering the same and are zoom s major rival in the business market microsoft is upgrading its products with technology from startup openai the company in early march said company president greg tomb a former cloud computing executive at alphabet s google will leave they also mentioned in feb 7 that they will cut 1 300 jobs or about 15 of its workforce as the coronavirus crisis eases retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to zoom s success for customers with one to 10 employees renewals are expected to slow as the economy reopens and shelterinplace orders lift there s expected to be less turnover of larger customers in the business market zoom rivals include ringcentral rng cisco systems google and others growth in annual recurring revenue for business customers with contracts topping $100 000 is one metric to monitor in july 2021 zoom video and five9 fivn which automates call center services announced a deal to merge the allstock deal was originally valued at $147 billion but the companies terminated the agreement on sept 30 zoom video aims to be a player in the contact center market with its own products and services what to do for earnings over the last 2 years the shares averaged a move of 74 with earnings regardless of direction options currently are pricing in a biggerthanusual move tho i m going to consider this a lotto play and grab calls 1124 70c 142 why because i believe it s really time that they turn things around with their ai usage and increasing customer base if earnings are bad it s simply not going to crash low enough for puts to be profitable however with expecations pegged at where they are calls might be the move here keep in mind like my other posts this isn t financial advice i d like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play this hopefully will help you with future earning plays too later this week we have nvda

what happens if you follow jim cramer exactly a multiyear study of mad money picks jim cramer gets a lot of attention both positive and negative some people say that you should do the opposite of what he says and you would make money i sticked with a simpler approach trust noone but numbers below you can find the statistics for executing long positions for all the mad money buy mentions short for sell mentions opening positions every morning at 930am on the day after the show holding until 930am next day and repeating the same the setup i ran 2 strategies short and long below is the setup each strategy tracks all the historical mad money calls and updates with new every night $10k distributed daily equally among all stocks on each side strategy setup the results i was a bit skeptical at first thinking that it would be mimicking the overall market performance at best or even losing money i was pleasantly surprised with 2022 performance first 1186 on the long side ytd 2853 on the short side ytd then i decided to backtest it since 2016 and here is what i got x200b annual gains of long short combined 20162022
$bbby yes there is still hope but it is not looking good at all is the short squeeze thesis still relevant a simple short guide for regards note for mods idk if this qualifies as a dd so i ll just post it as a discussion post disclaimer nothing i say is financial advice i do not even have enough knowledge of the market to be confident in what i am saying so there is no reason you should be confident in what i say position 200 shares 1555 as of yesterday sold 150 shares this morning down 75 of your life savings now you ll have to sell your car to keep your wife s boyfriend happy that s fine you made a bet it looks like it s not working out or is it if you ve sold or plan to sell today and keep what you have left good for you that is how a normal human being functions insert all that crap about sometimes you win sometimes you lose anyways let s get to it first off in response to people saying it is not over yet i have to say yes it is kind of i would say at this point it is not worth putting or pouring money you need into $bbby chances are just like many failing companies the company will be liquidated or there will be a merger with another company you can hold your bags in hopes of some type of merger with a huge company which may drive the price up that said as a true regard i did not buy $bbby for its fundamentals fuck that shit i m here for a squeeze and you are too probably so i am not gonna go any further into fundamentals and boring details unless it is relevant and i will keep this as simple as i can not because i want everybody to understand because i do not know any better now let s look at the short squeeze thesis and see if it is still valid reminder i do not know what i m saying if i am wrong please correct me it ll be appreciated i am not a financial advisor i hold a position in $bbby x200b the squeeze thesis $bbby has been a target for short sellers for quite some time the fundamentals of the company are shit and so it s logical that people would short it shorts are basically hoping that the company will go bankrupt and they ll make a shitload of money when ufataspirations looked into the reports in the dd linked above he saw there are around 27 million shares short as of july 29th and a considerable amount of those shares are below $7 that means shorts are losing money and there is a chance they ll cover their shorts to stop their losses and if the price goes high enough shorts will get margin called and forced to close their positions there were also a lot of call options ranging from $10 to $20 and some even up to $80 now i have no idea how options work i was never into them i just know that if there are enough call options spread from $10 to $20 it will cause an upward momentum when they are exercised again i m not sure if that s right so read the dd linked above the point is that the options hinted at an upward momentum which is devastating for shorts to sum up there were enough shorts for a short squeeze to happen and there was evidence of a good up trend that would trigger the squeeze therefore there is a chance for a squeeze i m sure there was more into the squeeze thesis at that time but a high si and the call options were enough for me to make a bet x200b is the squeeze thesis relevant now yes in fact it s looking somewhat promising at the moment the si is above 50 percent meaning more than half the float is shorted today s trading volume is nearing 100 of the float and $bbby is on the reg sho list which according to investopedia is a list containing securities whose transactions failed to clear for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency if i am not mistaken this implies that the price decline is due to short selling and so the decline is temporary overall everything is set up for a short squeeze to happen but what everybody needs to understand is that there needs to be a catalyst or something that would cause the price to go up unless the price jumps high enough for the shorts to get margin called or decide to cut their losses there will be no short squeeze to summarize the squeeze thesis is still relevant but at least i do not see how there will be an upward momentum to cause the squeeze i still think it is possible that is why i did not close my position entirely but i do not think it is likely point is do not do something you regret if you can afford to gamble make a bet therapy session ends
nvda will reach other galaxies i have seen some fear about nvda so i travelled across the internet and in my office work in ai field to gather anecdotal evidence that is best for making decisions as it is asymmetric information so apparently all of these small ai startups are super popular their products are selling like wildfire and reps are getting rich not only are they selling these gen ai apps are making companies incredibly efficient it s like as significant as the invention of the wheel venture capitalists just can t stop putting money into these genius ideas that are so transformative big tech as well the metaverse is going insane microsoft and googles ai products are transforming how we conduct business with ai and even more ai just making it so no one even has to show up to work anymore it s internet 40 corn is doing incredible and farming corn alternatives for trading will just always be incredibly valuable as the dollar is just so weak and you can t track corn or corn alternatives they allow you to escape the irs and live your libertarian utopia fantasies thank god all of this is true so that we can justify the current price of nvda such a glorious company my price target is $2000 and even then it s a steal

why the minimum holding period does not apply to ryan cohen dispelling copium when you want to sell either restricted or control securities you must file a form 144 the key word there is or because restricted and controlled securities are quite different restricted securities as the name implies have restrictions on them this would occur for example if you work for a company that provides shares as a part of their compensation to you but doesn t want you to immediately sell them this is not the case for ryan cohen he bought his shares on the open market the reason he needs to file form 144 is because he is a large shareholder making him an affiliate making his securities control securities x200b control securities are those held by an affiliate of the issuing company an affiliate is a person such as an executive officer a director or large shareholder in a relationship of control with the issuer control means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question whether through the ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise if you buy securities from a controlling person or affiliate you take restricted securities even if they were not restricted in the affiliate s hands x200b additionally here is a quote from the same sec website stating in clear terms that only restricted securities are subjected to the holding period rule the holding period only applies to restricted securities because securities acquired in the public market are not restricted there is no holding period for an affiliate who purchases securities of the issuer in the marketplace but the resale of an affiliate s shares as control securities is subject to the other conditions of the rule x200b there is even more misinformation being spread claiming that the filing of form 144 gives ryan cohen the option but does not compel him to sell or that it means he will sell sometime in the next 90 days this is a little more unclear but as far as i can tell there is no reason to file this form without the intention to sell i would even speculate that it could be viewed as market manipulation if rc were to file the form and not sell and he could be opened up to lawsuits the sec website goes on to state a person filing a form 144 must have a bona fide intention to sell the securities referred to in the form within a reasonable time after the filing of the form x200b tldr ryan cohen paperhanded x200b x200b edit this statement appears at the top of form 144 transmit for filing 3 copies of this form concurrently with either placing an order with a broker to execute sale or executing a sale directly with a market maker which makes it pretty clear that rc has placed a sell order x200b disclaimer i have no positions in bbby

inflationstagflation might not gut the saver but instead force them to take risks dd $tsm $tm x200b many people expect that there will be an economic recession and if not stagflation stock market analysts mostly those featured on cnbc are criticizing the fed for not hiking rates faster and tapering to counter inflation that is out of control i on the other hand think differently the us dollar is currently the strongest currency in the world now trading on par with the euro swiss franc strengthened against asian currencies jpy twd vnd rmb sgd yes a strong dollar might mean imports are cheaper and more spending abroad but this also means that the rest of the world is more heavily impacted by inflation despite the inflation figures being higher in the united states devaluation of the currency when prices are inflated means less purchasing power and the saver may or may not be gutted down the road but will this ever happen who knows what i do know is what happens when prices and wages go up there is an attempt at equilibrium a balancing that occurs it might be rocky and typically odds are in favor of rising costs as we have seen repeatedly throughout history but through this balancing act inflation will normalize again after all inflation is a measure of the rate of change of prices over time in physics termed velocity vs acceleration prices might continue to go up but its rate of increase is a completely different measurement what might it be that is stopping the feds from hiking quickly with treasury yields at 3 we want more increases but any more increases will continue to devalue the old bonds and bond funds crushing 401ks putting the hardworking americans at risk that s a big no no a hard paul volcker will stop inflation in its tracks but i think our national debt is already large enough to say no to issuing more debt that s why the feds don t want to touch the gas or the brakes as this directly affects v prime inflation is not currently out of control prices won t ever come back down but it s rate of increase will so what s my plan when i don t want to spend but saving is also risky i think the economic downturn here might just force some people to park their money in attempts to protect it people might invest it in education to look for a higher paying job people might invest in the saturated real estate market even though high mortgage rates are usually a deterrent for the typical 95 families people might spend it now because they might lose it later people might invest it back in the stock market the saver will be forced to take risks but in less risky areas the increase in prices will make people want to flee cash especially those countries facing a currency devaluation take venezuela for example due to hyperinflation the stock market went up over 2800 in a short amount of time with increased prices and an unknown cost for rd it is difficult to say a new competitor will come out of the blue and steal away market share without burning cash all in all inflated prices might just make it more costly to own valuable companies going forward let alone starting a company what s my prediction i believe foreign investments will suddenly be very popular again especially the large caps that have proven sustainable profit margins operating margins and have recently sold off am i a ccp advocate no china might have attractive investments touting the largest and boldest earnings but i am a bit more risk adverse what i am looking at are companies like tsmc and toyota these two companies supply the world with most of the components in electronics vehicles machinery and they have superb margins they are two of the many backbones to the world during this critical time companies that are too big to fail and ingrained into the global economy and more importantly it s country of origin considerations i took when picking these two companies relevance margins pe peg currency valuation economic outlook market crash great reset would be coolnot really good luck timing the market i ll just buy more of these companies if they hold the same backbone status this is wsb where the lottos with earnings around the corner i might just get some 88c 714 for tsm immediately after iv crush if any tldr op owns tsm and tm
es supportresistance by adam mancini as long as above 3770 adam believes es will fill out channel es in and ultimately test 397080 then 4020 last place he would try to go long is 3770 supports are 3800 3770 3740 3705 3680 3640 below 3640 meltdown commences to 3580 3500 resistances are 384055 38953900 major 3915 3930 3975 4015 i am sure your thinking take this manure to rinvesting hear me out why do you think so many buy high and sell low they see price going up and they buy calls and as soon as they buy the price goes down they blindly purchase just before a resistance level or they see price going down and as soon as they buy puts the price starts going up again they purchase those puts right into a support level i know you are probably not the brightest tool in shed you are probably on your break from flipping burgers and don t have much time but listen to me technical analysis works it s just you are getting your information from morons probably from wsb the crayon lines you are looking probably are drawn by idiotic barely intelligible functioning members of society people that you probably run away in real life or at least ignore okay they might be 23 people here in wsb who know technical analysis so you don t know anything about technical analysis you have a little of money to gamble you work hard at wendy s this is your hard earn money your tired of been poor you decided to buy options give yourself a chance with those options is there someone out there that could help you luckily for you there is a nerd that publishes accurate supportresistance levels his name adam mancini with over 134k followers he publishes supportresistance levels for es daily in his twitter account okay i should explain this since you are probably slow es sp futures is almost identical to sp standard poor s 500 index during normal trading sessions and spy spdr sp 500 spy etf tracks sp i know what you will say that nerd who draws crayon lines is trying to sell me a newsletter for $23 a month for you probably that is a lot of money working your minimum wage job you don t need it i am a subscriber i find it very useful and educational adam provides supportresistance levels bear scenario bull scenario his trading plan and his strategy you are here in wsb to trade like adam you need a brain need to be disciplined need to be sophisticated need to be able to read price action need to be patient you are working at wendy s you are not a trader you are a gambler okay so his levels useless to me no mate please read the following for you to understand a support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level a resistance level is the opposite of a support level this means that there are more sellers than buyers it is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises again this means that the price is more likely to bounce off this level rather than break through it however once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level a previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up and conversely a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back once an area or zone of support or resistance has been identified those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because as a price reaches a point of support or resistance it will do one of two thingsbounce back away from the support or resistance level trading ranges or violate the price level and continue in its direction trading breakouts until it hits the next support or resistance level the basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sellsell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold therefore consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area trading breakouts a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume the first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points once the asset trades beyond the price barrier volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout s direction breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases large price swings and in many circumstances major price trends when trading breakouts it is important to consider the underlying asset s support and resistance levels the more times an asset price has touched these areas the more valid these levels are and the more important they become at the same time the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to this doesn t happen all the time but when it does it is called a false breakout therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts markets regularly cycle between clean trend and choppy consolidation spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall usually after a large move in market a consolidation phase occurs after choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken everyone focuses on being smart but not being stupid is actually more important not being stupid is essential for survival do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance do not buy options when market consolidating do not bet it all in one move you might get lucky and win big but eventually you will lose big is better to trade level to level with proper size position using risk management buy calls when strong resistance shatters buy puts when strong support fails buy options during breakouts when market is trending remember after large move expect market to consolidate to be in range for a day or two i probably will regret this but i will answer any question regarding supportresistance levels not responsible for how you use this information your money your decisions lotto tickets 01 dte options only buying if breakouttrend exists buying puts below 3770

unsolicited testicle reads june 18 2022 edition been reading a lot of assumptions here in the posts and daily threads recently alot of people think we re due for a bounce and just as many if not more say otherwise i have no idea what you retards are basing your conclusions on but here are some lines i drew on my charts to share with the group some of you get it the other half need to find jebus spy s 1hour chart here we have a falling wedge usually a bullish consolidation pattern that s been validated with at least 3 contact points on both top and bottom also reinforced by the bullish divergence in both the rsi and the ppo makes me think that we do see a nearterm bounce likely this coming week what does the divergence mean it means that as the price action makes lower lows the momentum indicators are making higher lows this typically indicates that there s more buying than the price action is leading us to believe spy s 1day chart moving onto the daily chart we can see a clear breakdown on the larger falling wedge as well as the falling broadening consolidation wedge patterns which means my previous conclusion may well be total bullshit in addition to this we also see a longer term bullish divergence extending since may in the rsi which we re right on the knife s edge on either extending it further or completely invalidating it should know this week the ppo divergence hasn t yet validated so a longer term recovery isn t yet in the cards unfortunately that said the bottom line is our fed flipflopaccommodation trendline every time we ve hit it marks a fed policy reversal 2008 2019 and 2020 which aligns with what a lot of economists are theorizing that the fed will trigger a recession with its aggressive hiking and will be forced to back off not saying they ll reduce rates but perhaps take a pause sometime this summer to allow the economy markets to catch their breath anyway this is just my insight and since market sentiment is so bad while fundamentals are finally starting to come back into play still not 100 reliable just yet nearterm technicals are all i really have to go off of not going to throw good money after bad on a hunch take it or leave it don t really care what you think about this hopefully a few of you find value in it positionsi ve recently flipped long taking starter positions on friday after riding the capitulation down of the market pricing in the 75bp hikes for this month and next ba 715c $140spy 715c $365vix 630p $30sofi $6 cost average and continuing to accumulate shares through the recession edit tldr fuck you and learn how to read a chart

market recap 42023 things are bad but not all bad and the fed is not done yet tldr things are bad but not all bad and certainly not bad enough for the fed to change course economic indicators are flashing red but consumers are still in good shape earnings on the other hand may face more pain down the road global cb tightening continues bad for stocks x200b the fed global tightening continues yesterday i mentioned we should keep an eye on global liquidity and here is a major one ecb accounts a very large majority agreed with mr lane s proposal to raise the ecb s key interest rates by 50 basis points a number of members seeing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside over the entire horizon fed s mester need to get rate above 5 to meet 2 inflation goal how much higher than 5 rates will need to go and how long will need to stay there will depend on the economy us weekly jobless claims at 245 000 last week est 240 000 us apr8 week continuing claims 61k to 1 865 000 getting close to prepandemic level again the fed s target is 45 and we are still far from there the economy just as the market starts to cheer about the surprise beat of the empire state manufacturing index on monday here comes the faceslapping news philadelphia fed apr business index 313 vs mar 232 8th negative month in a row negative last 10 of 11 lowest since may 2020 break down forecast 250 to 117 business conditions were 232 in last month april prices paid fell to 82 vs 235 new orders rose to 227 vs 282 employment rose to 02 vs 103 shipments rose to 73 vs 254 delivery time fell to 250 vs 243 inventories fell to 179 vs 112 prices received fell to 33 vs 79 unfilled orders rose to 111 vs 213 average workweek rose to 84 vs 220 sixmonth outlook rose to 15 vs 80 sixmonth outlook for capex fell to 54 vs 38 here is the bright side both new orders and shipments rose and the sixmonth outlook rose too both price paid and price received fell so good for disinflation employment rose unfilled orders rose and the average workweek rose so it s not as bad as it looks lei fell again in march with the recession looming the us lei fell to its lowest level since november of 2020 consistent with worsening economic conditions ahead the weaknesses among the index s components were widespread in march and have been so over the past six months which pushed the growth rate of the lei deeper into negative territory the conference board forecasts that economic weakness will intensify and spread more widely throughout the us economy over the coming months leading to a recession starting in mid2023 i have mentioned multiple times in my previous posts that this indicator is a leading indicator for growth and highly correlated to stock performance global liquidity normally leads lei and ism which again needs to be closely monitored which were up since the beginning of the year however the liquidity increase turns out to be just temporary and is scheduled to decline from here due to more tightening activities from cbs bad for stonks but on the bright side the coincident economic index was up again in march and has been rising over the past six months component indicators include payroll employment personal income less transfer payments manufacturing trade and sales and industrial production so there s no recession just yet based on past data when lei was at this level the us economy would head into a recession 100 of the time but lei is very heavily focused on manufacturing and currently service is holding pretty strong and is in fact still growing consumers are still spending what recession amex card member spending rose 16 on a fxadjusted basis travel and entertainment spending grew 39 fxadjusted march was a recordsetting spending month highest we have ever had amex reaffirmed guidance for the full year not seeing a slowdown in the consumer segment in the us delinquency is expected to be below prepandemic levels in 2023 omnicom ceo prior to this call i was talking to the ceo of adobe and one of the things he was saying is i wish people would stop talking the economy down because business is great confirmation that overall consumers are still spending heavily and that the service side of the economy is still pretty strong but not everyone is optimistic blackrock vice chairman hildebrand i don t see a soft landing happening don t see any scenario where we have us interest rate cuts this year blackstone ceo i think inflation is definitely cooling it is increasingly in the rearview mirror and we see it in our portfolio companies but the fed will hold rates at an elevated level for an extended period of time the housing market is still pretty strong inventory is simply too low no one wants to sell mixed signals on housing sp 1500 homebuilding index blue has rallied sharply off low and is consistent with recent move higher in homebuilder sentiment orange as both confirm recent firming in housing market however the median us home sale price fell 33 in march to $400 528 the largest yearoveryear drop since 2012 follows february s 12 drop which was first annual decline since 2012 in last week s post i mentioned consumers are doing ok with higher savings and lower debt than before the pandemic here is another piece of evidence apollo us households are in excellent shape household leverage is currently at levels last seen in the early 1980s if the unemployment rate rises consumer spending will slow down but the starting point for us households is very strong that s partially why i think the fed can and will keep rates higher for longer because consumers are doing ok which gave the fed the confidence to keep going retail sales continue to slow down with no sign of rebounding in sight weekly retail sales have eased to 11

cof capital one way undervalued why did i buy 420 shares of cof you might ask because my boy buffet jumped on that train maybe or maybe it s because i am smart enough to read an income statement looking at cof s income statements 2023 q1 back to q1 2020 there is 23 growth in total revenue from $725b to $89b why is their eps decreasing from highs in q2 2021 of $762 to $232 in q1 2023 because they are setting aside cash for potential credit losses in q1 2023 alone they set aside $28b which is taken as an expense in banking and called a provision for credit losses in q2 2021 $116b was used right now cof is the most undervalued bulge bracket bank showing consistent revenue growth driven by increased interest rates and increasing credit card debt in the us they are trading far below their competitors at only a 74 pe their pricebook value is 082 and priceev is only 087 this bank is a steal yes there is fear that charge offs will go through the roof in a recession sorry but that s not going to happen look at the labor market j po can increase rates all he wants but people will continue to have jobs and continue to buy shit on ccs that they don t need and pay the minimum balance monthly additionally their loan portfolio may decrease in value but they are mostly htm and they have the deposit balances that it would take a black tuesday bank run to decrease their liquidity to the point of catastrophe tell me why i m wrong bozos

a little piece of nonfinancial advice regards my fellow regards i know what you re all thinking after a rough morning like this one how could we have been tricked again into holding these massive bags well you fucking morons you should know that meme stocks are highly volatile and are not for the feinthearted or the paperhanded secondly you only take a loss once you sell i will repeat that for the regards in the back of the bus you only take a loss when you sell yea the price tanked on the announcement news but that was because of the legitimately regarded folks who are actually paying attention to bbby s fundamentals they paperhanded because the fundamentals don t look stellar and of course they fucking don t you dipsticks it s a pretty shit company tbh but that s never been the play here the shorts have doubled down and are still holding their positions so we need to do the same this massive dip from the paperhands should be considered a 40 off sale on the stock and for all you $27 fomo bag holders now s your chance to average down we apes can lock up their shares in our diamond hands and keep the pressure up even after yet another massive sell off we ve recovered to about $9 or roughly up 85 from a month ago the point is this is not financial advice and you fuckers are on your own i m just telling you to use your regarded little brains and stay focused on the overall picture tldr the squeeze is still on drown out the rest of the noise over and out you fucking monkees edit i got you uenvironmentalfilm93 position 43 shares $1561

inflation explanation for highly regarded individuals and what it actually means well folks the cpi updates came out today and with those updates a flood of idiots also came along as per usual and completely misrepresented what the data show whether this is to try to push sentiment in one direction or due to sheer ignorance is unclear but ignorance is not a defense that holds up in court so first let me explain a hugely important point and the reason why i m making this post in the first place inflation is not down i know many of you did not make it past addition but these statistics are being referred to in a second order manner this means that the degree to which prices are changing broadly speaking has gone down as opposed to prices themselves which are far less likely to go down anytime soon prices are increasing it s just that the amount prices are increasing by increased less than a bunch of nerds had decided it would to say this means inflation is down is not only horribly inaccurate but dangerously stupid which i guess could probably serve as the slogan of this sub so now that that s out of the way let s break the rest of this down for those of you that read at a third grade level and do math at an even lower level today it was reported that the consumer price index cpi which measures a wide basket of goods and services rose 01 from the previous month and increased 71 from a year ago the labor department reported tuesday so once again prices are still rising that s it that s all the news was what does this mean it means that broadly speaking things are 01 more expensive compared to last month and 71 compared to this time last year if you itemize it by the various categories that broadly make up this basket of stuff some stuff is up and some stuff is down notably according to the bureau of labor statistics bls the index for shelter was by far the largest contributor to the monthly all items increase more than offsetting decreases in energy indexes the food index increased 05 percent over the month with the food at home index also rising 05 percent do you hear that people food and shelter prices rose yes food prices can be variable but still this is very concerning it is being pitched as rosier than it is when these press releases come out look at all of the major legacy media outlet postings which i m sure most of you don t trust anyway it s all being reported as better than expected a term we hear in the investing community if you wanna call this sub that all the time you can just as easily reframe this as holy shit prices are still rising even after significant increases in fed interest rates what economists decide to predict it will be is still an arbitrary measure relative to sentiment just an educated guess for what it might be if you had an eating disorder and decided you wanted to lose weight you could tell yourself you guess you will only have gained 20 pounds if it comes in at 15 pounds instead you beat expectations but you still haven t figured out how to diet that s what this is we re trying to put the economy on a diet and it s still not working we ve just arbitrarily decided it s less bad i m not saying the sky is falling either i just don t wanna see everyone in here baghold harder than they already would just because cnbc who employs fucking jim cramer said inflation is actually going away and you believed it because you don t even know what any of this shit really means you ll notice too that on the back of this news the market spiked and then slowly sold off x200b tldr because 34 of you can t read this many words inflation is still here the degree to which prices have still gone up came in lower than expected x200b eta visual mod agreed which means i m right
should i buy 30k worth of yeezys to hold and resell i have 30k that i ve been holding off to invest in the market however kanye and adidas terminated their partnership meaning yeezys will not be made as they are now they will become more rare i want to go on stockx a shoe reselling platform and buy 30k worth of yeezys since it s a physical asset it could also be a good hedge against inflation this is probably a safer bet than 90 of strategy s on this sub i m wondering if anyone has some insight i think in this market it might be the best investment i can make the nike yeezy line which was also discontinued has gone up a ton in value from what i ve seen is this a no risk guaranteed bet here s a quote from an article i read resellers predicted the price of yeezys could jump nearly 50 percent which would put the shoes at an average of $400 per pair

a continuation of crayons vs doomers i made this post awhile ago talking against some of the doomerism we saw at 4350 and 4300 on the sp here is a bit of a continued crayons for posterity x200b x200b we have had a downtrend in the short term peaking july around 4600 and coming all the way back to 4100 on the sp but we still didnt really break that prior low at 3850 so the greater uptrend is still intact in fact after spiking below that uptrend line i drew in that could be drawn a lot of ways we broke right back above it and seemingly broke the short term downtrend by setting a higher high its a bit early to know for sure we are barely above the prior high but the uptrend seems intact still if you seem my prior post this could all be the long term continuation of a downtrend and thats still intact until like 4850 on the sp
the market is about to drop again cause fed we ll go to that point there won t be any hesitation about that j powell don t believe the propaganda this is not an opportunity for some of the longerterm investors here it s a short squeeze a bear market rally and there is absolutely nothing wrong with playing this rally which could give one a quick 510 gain take it play the cards as they are dealt however there is absolutely no sign whatsoever that this bear market is even close to being over will it be 40 down 50 down who knows or perhaps none of that because the fed could easily panic after stocks drop 30 if you are a longerterm investor act like one think long term wait patiently for the real buying opportunity it will come but it s not now

investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams systematize decision making rules should be timeless and universal context dd this is the looooong winded part 1 we have this broken down in terms of economic principles and investment principles because the markets follow the economy to understand the market you must understand the economy to do that you must understand the four major forces three important equilibrium and two levers 2 the economy and the markets are like a perpetual motion machine of the interaction of the above 432 3 over time things get better in the quality of our personal lives we look to increase the quality of our living individually and as a society this is called productivity 4 productivity is the most important thing but we don t really see it because it evolves over a more extended period 5 the big things that we see and feel every day are debt cycles there is a longterm debt cycle and a shortterm debt cycle 6 by shortterm debt cycle i usually mean the business cycle 7 for instance if the economic activity rate is too low in a recession and there is weakness in the economy the central banks cbs produce credit 8 credit is buying power cbs produce that credit which creates purchasing power for goods services and financial assets and then the economy picks up and that cycle typically lasts seven to ten years 9 as the economy picks up the demand rises relative to the capacity as you get later in the cycle the cbs hit the brakes raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy the unemployment rate is low because there is less slack in the economy they put the brakes on it by pulling the lever to increase interest rates they tighten monetary policy then you have a recession slow up which is the cycle 10 and because credit is buying power credit produces debt and debt means the obligation to pay back 11 it is crucial to understand that nature is cyclical first comes the stimulation then comes the paying back 12 when you produce credit you can spend more than you earn 13 and when you pay back you have to spend less than you earn 14 and that is the nature of the cycle most of us are aware and acquainted with this cycle 15 with that cycle comes market cycles and this is all that i mean by the shortterm debt cycle 16 there is also a longerterm debt cycle which is an accumulation of all those shorterterm debt cycles 17 because everybody wants things to go up they want their asset prices the markets and employment to go up 18 for that reason cbs will stimulate the economy typically lowering interest rates until interest rates hit zero 19 when interest rates hit zero they can t do that anymore which brings us to the need to print money and buy financial assets which we call quantitative easing qe and when cbs can t do qe anymore or there are limitations imposed we come to the end of the longterm debt cycle 20 so now we have covered a shortterm debt cycle a longterm debt cycle and productivity 21 now related to all of that is politics there are internal politics and external politics and in that normal cycle they are related 22 for example in 2008 and 2009 there was a debt cycle and interest rates hit zero and that is very similar to 1929 to 1932 there was a debt crisis and interest rates hit zero 23 and in both of those cases there was a printing of money and buying of financial assets and this caused those financial asset prices to go up and more economic liquidity and that particularly benefited those with financial assets and contributed to the wealth and income gap as did technology 24 as a result of that in the 1930s and also now politics entered the picture and the wealth gap is causing populism a populism of the left and populism of the right has an effect on the markets and an impact on the economy 25 so we are seeing a situation very similar to the 1930s in which we are seeing a rising power challenging an existing power which is a geopolitical cycle 26 when a rising power in the form of china is challenging an existing power in the form of the united states and if we look at the history and cycles of those periods there is a cycle of conflict and peace 27 typically peace happens after war because some dominant country wins the war and nobody wants to fight the dominant power which creates an extended period of peace 28 and i am not saying we will have a military conflict although that always exists as a possibility 29 these cycles have happened over and over again 30 politics can affect the cycles for example the shift in the united states to create a tax cut helps the corporate tax picture and causes stock prices to rise 31 okay those are all the cycles then we compare it to three equilibriums 32 first debt growth must be in line with the income growth required to service the debt 33 if debt growth is faster than the income growth that will service the debt we will have an adjustment and i am always doing a proforma what is the ability to service that debt this is the first equilibrium 34 the second equilibrium is that the economic activity or capacity utilization rate is neither too high nor too low that means if you have it pressing up too much or overheating the economy that will cause a tightening monetary policy and a correction 35 if you have it too low so that the economy is depressed and there s a lot of slack that s going to cause an adjustment to bring it up so always be watching where we are relative to that because that is a key driver of the cycles 36 the third equilibrium is that the projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums 37 in other words the capital markets produce the circulation of buying power in the form of this credit and this relationship of the cash to bond yields to stock yields and asset classes determines how money flows through the economy 38 and for normal condition for reasons i won t digress into is to have cash have a lower return than bonds that have a lower return from equities having to do with how the system works 39 cbs put cash on deposit and people with better ideas have to make a profit to use that money to create these other levels of economic activity and have higher returns 40 when that is not the case the way they tighten it is through the use of two levers 41 the two levers are monetary policy and fiscal policy 42 monetary policy is how the brakes and gas are put on and the brakes and the gas being put on become reflected in each of these other items 43 if debt growth is too high relative to income growth and capacity utilization is high or stretched cbs will tighten monetary policy 44 the tightening of monetary policy will change the projected return of cash relative to bonds and those equities and those risk premiums will slow the economy down 45 and that will drive those cycles and that s how the economy operates in this perpetual motion 46 if you could picture where you are in those cycles and what is happening you can anticipate what will happen next because it is that perpetual motion machine 47 that is the template in a nutshell you must constantly be thinking where are we now 48 here is some hard data for you 49 when you look at gdp going back to 1900 and again gdp is productivity there is a significant inevitable force that happens over a period of time even the most significant economic turbulence you know looks like a bump in that cycle productivity is a big force betting on productivity is a big force 50 as you get later in the longterm debt cycle what happens is that productivity begins to slow because there needs to be an investment and there needs to be other things when there is activity or prosperity you get more productivity a selfreinforcing cycle 51 suppose you examine charts showing productivity over a certain period in developed countries and china in that case you will see in varying degrees that productivity will bend over as they are later in their longerterm cycleus china japan etc 52 japan is later in that debt cycle and you see hardly any productivity growth 53 that is what productivity looks like now where are we in the shortterm debt cycle of the business cycle 54 see appendix a b to see what the cycle looks like 55 what happens from the capital markets stock market perspective as you begin to go to higher levels of operating rate and lower levels of unemployment cbs begin to tighten liquidity starts to tighten and risk premiums begin to rise 56 as of march of 2019 we were nine years into the cycle unemployment rates are comparatively low and there is less slack so it is no surprise that cb tightens monetary policy 57 the cb tightens monetary policy by either raising interest rates or lowering the purchases of the financial assets they buy by expanding the balance sheet and that is where we were as of q1 2019 58 if you look at how markets behave in that part of the cycle we break cycles into three pieces the early phase of the cycle the mid phase of the cycle and the late phase of the cycle 59 typically when you are late in the cycle it coincides with less attractive returns 60 interest rates hit their lows and can t go lower so we deal with quantitative easing 61 if you look at a chart going back to 1900 and examine the debt to gdp ratio to examine how now it seems like the cycle we went through in the 1930s 62 in other words because of the debt crisis and interest rates hitting zero you had the printing of money as evidenced by examining the cb balance sheet the monetary base and the acceleration of printing money the same thing happened in the 2008 financial crisis you can see the debt crisis you hit zero in interest rates they are stuck so they have to print the money and then we have the reaction 63 very similar to 1932 to 1937 as the economy picked up in 1937 they started to tighten monetary policy because they were worried the economy was overheating and inflation was going to rise and they caused a recession 64 that was the first time they used the word recession it was like redepression and they used the term recession which was the 1938 period 65 we talked about debt but there are also unfunded liabilities that we don t call debt which would be pension and health care liabilities there are a lot of liabilitiespromises out there that must be kept 66 as it relates to both the markets and the economy we have been in a golden age of capitalism in the following sense profit margins have more than doubled since 2000 meaning that if you didn t have an expansion in profit margin the stock market would be 40 lower 67 profit margins grew because of several factors such as efficiencies gained with technology globalization creating a larger market share and companies reducing union membership which reduced employee compensation and contributed to the growth of the wealth gap 68 the wealth gap or profit gap has been great for companies but it has not been great for a certain percentage of the population if you look at the conditions of the bottom 60 percent of the population and the bottom 60 means the majority the conditions have been bad 69 since 1980 there has been no real income growth in the united states in a fed survey 40 of all americans could not raise $400 in the event of an emergency so there is a gap 70 the wealth gap is seen by looking at the net worth of the top 110th of 1 of the population s net worth which is almost the same as the bottom 90 combined 71 as a result we have populism populism on the left and populism on the right that is a phenomenon that developed countries didn t use to have not only is it a political phenomenon but an economic and market phenomenon 72 because as we go into the political elections in countries such as the us and throughout europe it will be a conflict of capitalism over socialism or the left and the right and it will become extreme in both cases 73 and as these profit margins improved and corporate tax rates have gone down you also have cheap money used to buy back stock or make mergers which also helps boost stock prices 74 many of these items will not continue in q1 of 2019 this model predicted that profit margins would go down and you were at the best of the corporate tax rates so that likely won t go much lower 75 this all means that we are entering a new environment that will not be as conducive to purchasing financial assets by the cb simply put we are going from tailwinds to headwinds 76 to give you a flavor of what this political situation is like and the polarity and the entrenchedness you can look at charts going back to 1900 which show how conservative the republicans are through a survey to examine economically conservative and as of 2019 they are more conservative than ever 77 you can look at another chart back to 1900 examining how liberal democrats are in policy and they are also more liberal than ever 78 this means both parties have not had greater polarity than we have today 79 suppose you include the votes cast along party lines in each chart in other words republicans are sticking with republicans and democrats are sticking with democrats in that case it easily depicts the entrenched conflict we are having in the us 80 the political polarity is not just taking place in the us but also in europe it was expected that jeremy corbyn would remain in power in the uk which would impact capital flows 81 but france elected macron and the uk elected boris johnson boris is centerright and macron is socially and economically left 82 so we are relatively late in the cycle and entering a period where cbs have less power than they used to ease in conjunction with populism in election cycles 83 you can judge the capacity of a country to ease by looking at the level of interest rates relative to zero the amount of quantitative easing that can take place and its marginal effects 84 for example in the us you go from 25 to zero then you are done 85 but in europe there are limitations caps at 33 of certain types of debt that they can t go beyond unless there is some type of agreement politically which is very difficult to agree on anything so there is going to be a problem for the european central bank ecb to have the ability to stimulate 86 japan was somewhat similar when they had slightly negative interest rates reducing the ability to stimulate 87 so that is the lay of the land with markets and the economy with the 432 88 moving on to the rising power challenging the existing power china will be an important influence in the world we are operating in for the rest of our lifetimes and china will become an increasing influence in globalization and so on 89 when you examine the relative output of china and the us and what is likely in terms of equity market cap and share of debt securities outstanding you will see the strength of these powers 90 in other words the chineseasian markets are becoming more prominent liquid and effective these markets will play an important role as will the chinese economy in our environment not only in the form of trade but also in the form of geopolitical impacts mainly reflected in technology 91 if you look at history and what caused countries to succeed and fail it was mainly driven by technology 92 when you examine the rise and decline of world reserve currencies first to do that you first have to examine the arc of each of these currencies 93 there is the us dollar before that you had the british pound and before that you had the dutch guilder and as a result of that you need to understand several things about the economies that made them a reserve currency in the first place how did they become reserve currencies and how did they lose their reserve currency status this means we must watch several factors statistics numbers and indices 94 so we get down to the six main factors you can judge a country s power by 1 innovation meaning technology education and competitiveness 2 economic output 3 share of world trade 4 military strength 5 financial center strength 6 reserve currency status 95 power is a vague thing and you can have economic power you can have military power and you can have power in different ways 96 we will examine these factors over four cases the dutch cycle the british cycle the us cycle and the chinese cycle 97 in examining these cycles the first is innovation meaning technology education and competitiveness mostly a new technology like the 5g technology and the issues pertained to huawei and other technology companies 98 if you have the technology it works both economically and militarily and in the case of the dutch it was the ability to build ships that could go anywhere worldwide and they took those ships and because the europeans were experts in fighting they always fought with each other they took the guns put them on the boats went out to the rest of the world and accounted for half of the world trade 99 and when they go out there with half of the world trade they bring their money the dutch guilder and when they bring the money it becomes a world reserve currency 100 to go out into the world they must have a military to support that 101 and so these cycles go on and if you were to look at a chart to exemplify this with the us being blue and china as red going back to 1500 and averaging these things what you would see is the chinese have typically been number one or number two 102 although the world was a different size those were all very far away places compared to the way we live now where it is all one sort of world 103 and this will conclude the economic principles as of 2017 we were relatively late in the business cycle metaphorically the 7th inning 104 there is a relative tightening of the business policy and monetary policy we have less economic capacity greater polarity and a situation where we will have political issues and those political issues will be market issues 105 because as we start to think will this be a movement to the right or the left that will impact capital flows 106 now we will transition to the list of investment principles appendix c 107 first is 1 the theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows 108 in other words every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow 109 so when we think about what is something worth we look at those projected cash flows and we discount them with an interest rate to arrive at the theoretical value 110 the actual value that it will trade is listed in investment principle 2 111 2 the actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending if i calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something divided by the quantity of goods sold 112 so we should always be looking at how much will be spent what are the spenders motivations and determine the quantity 113 in short we estimate the total spending divided by the quantity to estimate the price 114 and 3 asset classes will outperform cash over the long term 115 this is required otherwise the economy s gears come to a screeching halt 116 and 4 the out performance of asset classes over cash ie beta cannot be very positive for too long 117 because if it were it would be easy if it were positive you would borrow cash buy the long things and make a lot of money 118 it comes with big bumps along the way 119 this brings us to 5 assets are priced to discount future expectations so when inflation growth risk premiums and discount rates 120 and 6 every investment is a return stream 121 what i mean by that is every day you can mark it to the market and you know what it s like so the key is to put together portfolios of return streams so that they balance well 122 dalio says that whatever success he has or bridgewater has experienced has to do with knowing how to deal with their not knowing more than anything they know this is because what you don t know is a lot and you can reduce your risk a lot more than you will reduce your return by knowing how to diversify well 123 this is investment principle 7 diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns so it improves returnto risk ratio 124 and then we need to get to the next one which deals with understanding that there are two types of return streams 8 return streams can be either betas or alpha 125 what i mean by a beta return stream is that there is an intrinsic reason that that asset class will behave in a certain way that you will know 126 in other words if growth rises faster than discounted and interest rates don t rise much you know that stocks will go up 127 so there is an environmental so you can structure that 128 alpha is a zerosum game in other words for me to produce alpha i have to outperform and take money away from somebody else this is zerosum like a game of poker 129 and again 9 the key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams 130 and to balance them you have to risk balance them which is 10 return streams can be riskadjusted to be risk balanced 131 in other words somebody might think that if i put 50 of my dollars in stocks and 50 of my dollars in bonds i am diversified but that is not true because the volatility of stocks is twice the volatility of bonds and because of that you have to risk balance them 132 and then 11 the holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams 133 and lastly systematizing decision rules is critical 12 systematize decisionmaking rules should be timeless and universal 134 what i mean by that is we should write down the criteria for investing and then we take those criteria and test them through all periods of time and all countries timeless and universal 135 because if something happened at one time and your process is not working at that time then it must be that you haven t explained the differences 136 and so by forcing ourselves to try to make those rules timeless and universal it becomes the standard that we operate by so all rules that you operate by should be timeless and universal 137 3531 138 if we were to pass through some charts for example going back to 1975 and you would think of this chart as the rolling returns of asset classes you would be able to see that all asset classes have good times and times that are bad 139 and on average they are above zero but they all have down periods 140 and inevitably what happens is that most investors love the asset classes that did well the biggest mistake of most investors is that they think the investment that did well is a good investment rather than thinking of it as a more expensive investment 141 so you can break the drivers of asset class returns into a few categories which is true for all asset classes two main things drive it inflation and growth 142 basically if you tell me that inflation is going to be higher than expected and growth be higher than expected then i would know what to invest in higher than discounted not sure if he messed up on 3708 when he said higher than expected and higher than discounted 143 but if we knew that we would all know what to invest in 144 so those become the two main drivers they can rise or decline 145 and then there are discount rates and risk premiums sometimes written as risk premia 146 discount rates mean the interest rate impacts all asset classes because the interest rate is the discount rate you use to compare the cash flows 147 so if you raise the interest rate that is negative for all asset classes and then you have when you strip all that risk premium out that equals the following 148 a chart that shows what happened in history in relation to that context 149 as an example a chart would show growth assets relative to assets that you would hold if you had a falling growth environment and assets that you would hold if you had a rising growth environment and the same with inflation and then add what the discount rate is and then also looking at the risk premium which would be the residual of that and that s what we have an allweather return an allweather return is an optimally diversified portfolio 150 and if you were to examine the data on diversification you would see that diversification can substantially improve your risktoreturn ratio 151 turning to a chart that would show the holy grail of investing 152 the xaxis shows the number of assetsalphas in the portfolio from 120 and yaxis shows the annual portfolio standard deviation 153 and if you can do what this chart depicts you will make a fortune and be very successful and it is simple but not easy 154 the concept is that if you can get 5 10 15 20 good uncorrelated investments you can substantially improve the return to risk ratio 155 the chart illustrates that diversification is more important than good even in picking the best investments 156 most people think give me the best investment and let me put all my money in what i think is the best investment but that is wrong 157 the goal is to find your best ten uncorrelated investments and put your money in that and you will do a lot better 158 so again if you look at that chart and the yaxis the standard deviation let s call that risk of 10 and imagine i invest in an asset that has 10 return and 10 standard deviation and let s say i put in a second investment that is 60 correlated with that third fourth fifth sixth and so on you can see how the risk in your portfolio would significantly be reduced 159 this means if you have a diversified portfolio of stocks fyi the average stock is about 60 correlated with average other stocks you can put in 100 investments you can put in 1 000 investments you are not going to materially reduce your risk relative to just putting in 5 10 which will reduce your risk by 10 to 15 if you have an uncorrelated return stream you can get actually get better than uncorrelated because you can have negatively correlated but let s say i put in an uncorrelated return stream you would see what the chart would show for example you more than cut your risk in half at five uncorrelated return streams if you go to 15 uncorrelated return streams you will reduce your risk by nearly 80 160 this means you have improved your return to risk ratio by a factor of 5 161 to recap you can reduce your risk significantly without reducing your return which is the key to it 162 so when i look at this i think there are two types of assets what s your strategic asset allocation mix what is your beta in other words what portfolio do you usually have in my opinion it should be highly diversified but along those lines in terms of something like half in growth half in inflation rising and declining then alphas you have to have a lot of different alpha in the case of bridgewater there are over 100 different types of alphas and about 130 different kinds of markets in terms of trading 163 appendix a coming soon reach out if you would like to assist 164 appendix b coming soon reach out if you would like to assist 165 appendix c same list from

brace yourselves the sp 500 is about to experience a crushing blow comparable to the 1929 crash hey fellow redditors i m here to share some unsettling news that s been keeping me up at night as i dove deep into the financial world i stumbled upon a harrowing revelation that sent shivers down my spine brace yourselves because the sp 500 is on the verge of an imminent and cataclysmic crash and when i say crash i mean a crash reminiscent of the devastating events of 1929 now i know what you re thinking not again haven t we learned from history but here s the thing history has an uncanny way of repeating itself especially when we least expect it the eerie parallels between our current economic landscape and the dark days of 1929 are too stark to ignore allow me to break it down for you 1 overinflated bubble back in 1929 the stock market experienced an unprecedented bubble prices skyrocketed driven by irrational exuberance and reckless speculation doesn t this sound familiar today we find ourselves in a similar situation where stock prices have soared to unsustainable levels detached from the underlying economic reality 2 excessive leverage in the years leading up to the 1929 crash investors were piling on massive amounts of debt to finance their stock purchases fast forward to the present day and we see a similar pattern emerging margin debt has reached record highs indicating a dangerous level of leverage that could spell disaster when the tide turns 3 fragile economic foundations just like in 1929 our economy is built on shaky foundations despite the illusion of growth and prosperity underlying issues such as income inequality rising debt burdens and geopolitical tensions threaten to bring it all crashing down the warning signs are everywhere but we choose to look away now you might be wondering when this impending doom will strike well my fellow redditors i believe we have only a few days left before the sp 500 plunges into chaos the catalyst could be any number of factors an unexpected geopolitical event a sudden shift in monetary policy or the bursting of a major market bubble whatever it may be the crash is inevitable and its impact will be felt far and wide i don t share this information to spread fear or panic rather i hope to encourage a dialogue and a greater awareness of the potential risks we face it s crucial to understand that the stock market is not invincible and we must remain vigilant in the face of mounting dangers while i urge you not to make hasty decisions based solely on my words i do recommend taking precautions diversify your investments ensure a wellbalanced portfolio and consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances remember the past has a way of teaching us valuable lessons but only if we re willing to listen stay informed be prepared and let s navigate these uncertain times together tldr the sp 500 is on the brink of a crushing crash that mirrors the devastating events of 1929 the stock market is rife with unsustainable bubbles excessive leverage and fragile economic foundations brace yourselves as this crash could occur in a matter of days it s time to prepare diversify and seek professional advice to weather the storm ahead disclaimer this post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice always do your own research and consult with a qualified professional before making any investment decisions
short shorts it s time to put your short shorts on cause $tsla is going to sink like a rock elon is facing losses on all sides and he can t seem to stay out of court he made his first interest payment so who knows when he will sell stock next the only thing investors are holding on to is higher sales volume and a new product in march more exposure for his software failures nice the next time $tsla is in the news it ll probably be because of how shittily they re made good luck bulls

why im shorting sallie mae you don t need anyone to remind you how oppressive student debt is for nearly 100mill americans slmwho advertises that they accept 95 of applications with a cosigner a cosigner which may run into liquidity problems if the housing market collapses with rising mortgage interestmay have trouble in coming months with defaults and the ability to find quality borrowers shorting the student loan bubble with sallie mae nasdaqslm on seeking alpha whose link i cannot offer here due to bots goes into this in thorough detail describing slm s exposure to student debt in particular the article is from 2018 even more relevant now that we are seeing all of the auto loan defaults i give it like six months i notice that vanguard and blackrock have already cut down some of their major long positions for slm but realize that navient has since been nationalized and slm now has to do its debt servicing as well as lending as navient has been up to too many illegal lending practices hint short the banks does not mean buy such and such rwallstreetbets censored token it means short the banks i m just outright shorting slm because across short interest and dividend payments it comes out to about half as much as put options but i can hold it for twice as long so its 4x cheaper per day if you are degenerate enough to do this be sure you are ok with at least the number of shares you short 26week volatility otherwise you will panic exit and you need to be careful to stay in your broker s cash and equity requirements slm is currently trading about as high as it has ever been with a market cap of $4billion this is not going to be a lehmanstyle big short you get rich off because fortunately slm isnt that big but a short position can be a good strategy for defense against a credit crisis and ensure your liquidity is high in a downturn also to mention they are racist to think that someone could take out a loan for a degree and with 9 interest pay it back in a climate of wild inflation wages stagnated beyond the point they even compensate for the cost and liability of doing the job let alone living and servicing debt for an ossified piece of paper that is proven not to be effective at successful learning outcomes is highly inflated many employers now able to command a master s degree and yet is from an institution that brags about how few people they deem worthy of their education that anyone can just get on the internet seriously 9 beats the sp most years you expect 95 of people to be able to find superior white collar wage after blowing four years in this pretentious academy writing papers on intersectionality and playing beer pong you have to account for those that dont even finish college too this is obviously usury enabled by the expansion of credit allowed by the governments policy to forgive loans it capitalizes on students ignorance that they were told college is the only option to lead a successful career this credit bubble is obviously met with an increase in price from universities that attract high profile students from across the globe including and especially those that don t work and pay taxes around the same area that funds the college perpetuating dependence on student loans i have trouble conceiving that these lending practices this demand for usury and the broad consensus on the legitimacy of our education system will be able to continue or will be able to withstand a credit crisis quotes from principles for managing big debt cycles by ray dalio to identify a big debt crisis before it occurs i look at all the big markets and see which if any are in bubbles then i look at what s connected to them that would be affected when they pop while i won t go into exactly how it works here the most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are 1 prices are high relative to traditional measures 2 prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels 3 there is broad bullish sentiment 4 purchases are being financed by high leverage 5 buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases eg built inventory contracted for supplies etc to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains 6 new buyers ie those who weren t previously in the market have entered the market 7 stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more and tight policy to cause its popping during such times as credit bubbles most people think the assets are a fabulous treasure to ownand consider anyone who doesn t own them to be missing out as a result of this dynamic all sorts of entities build up long positions large assetliability mismatches increase in the forms of a borrowing shortterm to lend longterm b taking on liquid liabilities to invest in illiquid assets and c investing in riskier debt or other risky assets with money borrowed from others andor d borrowing in one currency and lending in another all to pick up a perceived spread all the while debts rise fast and debt service costs rise even faster i insert here that a degree is the most illiquid asset imaginable seriously human capital concept at least in the context of education is propaganda perpetuated by the present academic hegemony if you think you can stand on a pillar of western condescension and bawk at china s evergrande for building cities in the middle of nowhere get off your high horse because at least the ccp instigated the three red lines to curb limitless credit here we are so indoctrinated by the education system that we told people that college is still a good investment at 9 interest and the government response is not to meet the high demand for professional status with a commensurate increase in capacity for university education or regulate usury but just to cancel debt to bandaid the problem though i believe any of these approaches does pose risk to banks since most lenders are leveraged eg they borrow to buy assets the impact of a 30 percent writedown on their net worth can be much greater for example the creditor who is leveraged 21 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth ie their assets are twice their net worth so the decline in asset value has twice the impact since banks are typically leveraged about 121 or 151 that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole some people mistakenly think that depressions are psychological that investors move their money from riskier investments to safer ones eg from stocks and highyield lending to government bonds and cash because they re scared and that the economy will be restored if they can only be coaxed into moving their money back into riskier investments this is wrong for two reasons first contrary to popular belief the deleveraging dynamic is not primarily psychological it is mostly driven by the supply and demand of and the relationships between credit money and goods and servicesthough psychology of course also does have an effect especially in regard to the various players liquidity positions still if everyone went to sleep and woke up with no memory of what had happened we would be in the same position because debtors obligations to deliver money would be too large relative to the money they are taking in the government would still be faced with the same choices that would have the same consequences and so on

remember when the fed intervened in the bond market during covid to promote stability now they are working to recreate such an environment the fed has literally brought investment grade bonds below where they were during peak covid fear their argument then was that this level of illiquidity would be the end of the world so they had to intervene to keep the bond markets functioning but now we have the same environment being created artificially by them as opposed to a virus and this is okay hard to wrap my head around this the only way this makes sense is if they tell some close connections what they will do for the next few months to a year such that they can profit from the volatility it s either that level of corruption or they are just incompetent and flying blind x200b x200b x200b

nvidia in numbers hello this post is not a buy or sell recommendation but simply a look at the numbers behind nvid and others fcf mkt cap yield ltm 5year total return cagr and price changes have added similar names nvid 12737 fcf mkt cap yield ltm pe peg margins and roe ntm next twelvemonths fwd nvid 356x fwd pe smci 421x meta 253x amz 417x tsm 205x nvid has a 21x fwd peg ratio smci 182x meta 164x amz 247x and tsm 296x broadcom 295x peg looks cheaper on a fwd pe 261x but not when factoring in fwd growth nvidia has 788x pfcf ltm however the return on equity ltm is 915 tsm no buybacks in ltm lots from meta broadcom msft forward pe time series nvid fwd pe 356x today is trading at mid of 5 year range the company traded at 708x fwd pe on may 25th 2023 earnings date where it beat eps by 1837 and was upgraded eps cagr nvidia inventory and turnover stats the expectations are clearly high when it comes to nvidia s price and earnings the two of which are mostly correlated i do believe the company has a moat and is rewarded for being pure play if nvidia continues to surprise earnings by 10 over the ntm the company should rerate significantly i m definitely a buyer at sub 2x peg if the company posts mild beats i do not think the company will significantly derate assuming it s capacity related and not demand driven earnings over the last 10 years eps actual vs analyst estimates you can see the stock gets slaughtered when posting a miss nvidia s next eps mean is $548 i do think the company will beat q4 eps by more than 62 expected increase earnings have increased an avg of 73 qoq ltm my guestimate is that nvidia will post $600 eps in the next report and surprise by 95 i hope these comps are somewhat helpful for nvid or related names the stock should perform well over the year when it delivers x200b goodluck my fellow regards x200b

82322 spy es futures and apple daily market analysis well you were expecting a massive 23 sell off and thought we were about to see a dump like june then you unfortunately got severely disappointed if you expected a gap fill today to 421 you also got disappointed if you expected spy to do anything but trade within the same about $1 range for 4 hours and 45 minutes you too were disappointed i haven t really see a day where the majority of price action was all within a tight range like that in a very long time that was a frustratingly boring day to watch on the daily you can see we closed out today as a gravestone doji which i have touched on this many times before a gravestone doji at the top as in when price is running up is usually a bearish reversal however when we are seeing a gravestone doji at the bottom of a trend when price is dropping then that usually is the signal of the bottom look at spy 817 89 82 and apple 89 82 726 and 617 for examples of what i mean the most bearish thing that occurred today in my opinion is that we attempted to break through the daily 20ema at 4149 and pretty much hit a brickwall once we hit that price and rejected we never saw it even attempted again the only small bullish caveat here is that we did wick over the daily 20ema which could be seen as a hint of whats to come today price magnet all day was around 413 so of course that will be where we need to watch the most tomorrow with the gap fill at 42122 now 215 away from close it is harder to imagine that bulls fill that gap tomorrow however 2 days are not out of the norm and with the vix closing just over 24 if that were to unwind back down to 2021 that would be a big push for spy green key resistance tomorrow 4152 black resistance line 4175 daily resistance level and 200ema at 418 4201 key support tomorrow 4113 4094 4076 support area for the july 29th to present bull run something to keep in mind that historically the spy gaps do usually fill within 2 days of course this doesn t always happen but it does have a history of doing so overall i am still expecting that over the next two days we are going to push green and see that gap fill on the daily and weekly once that gap is filled i believe we will see friday turn into a fairly red day as we are going to get jpow talking at the jackson hole which he is going to once again say all the same hawkish things he has said for the last 2 months expect this time markets are actually listening futures is what i will keep my biggest eye on as we go forward tonight and tomorrow we saw a nice hold of that key 4120 level as long as bulls can defend 4120 i do see a case to retest that 4130 level however if we do lose close daily below 4120 then we most likely are going to be looking for 4000 here by next week key support 4120 4100 4075 4040 projected new red bull channel key resistance 4120 black resistance line 4158 4184 daily 200ema 4210 overall the black resistance line that has been showing this current 3 day down cycle is at 4120 tomorrow in order for that line to hold and therefore trend we have to see es close below 4120 open below 4120 and never break 4120 tonight or tomorrow i do not personally for see that happening there really isn t much to see on spy weekly but on the futures weekly you can see we also bounced off of the weekly 8 20ema which is trending right at 4118 overall if we were to see a close below that then that would be a very strong indication of downside to come if those two emas hold as support that s strong bullish case under spy i spoke about how a gravestone doji is usually a bullish reversal when we are in a down trend i highlighted on apple everytime we had a gravestone doji on apple daily and you can see almost all of them were followed by a fairly green day to be honest this apple daily candle closed in no mans land we are trading within that 1664 to 1675 area where due to the gaps and wicks there really hasn t been much price action at all to gauge sentiment we are nearing the first gap at 16582 with only 09 to go until that gap would be filled tomorrow if we break down overall mostly on apple i am going to keep a close eye on 1664 if we were to break down through that support then i would think that the upside for spy and apple is more limited this week and that we might either consolidate down here or just drill apple weekly shows that that 1664 level is a very key support that we should keep and eye on too apple and spy weekly still do have gaps on their charts the vix is very interesting here to say the least so after trading so long down at that 20 level we have now spent two days trading up here around 24 we do have the gap on the vix which i did mention in my video we have not had one since the june sell off and whenever we do have a vix gap we don t usually see it left for more then 2 or 3 days vix also is still rejecting breaking out of this 242 level this is where we continue to keep our eyes on tomorrow if we break out over 242 tomorrow and see 25 then the sell off is likely to come if we see vix settle down and we see it start pushing down to 2223 like it tried to intraday today the gap fill is coming this is one of those times where the vix actually would be helpful to watch 10 challenge despite the pretty much terrible chart we had on spy to trade today i had a good day i took 2 calls for a 10 profit i am not sure about you guys but tos has been really screwing me over lately when it comes to fills and orders so yesterday you guys know my limit sell skipped over and now today i opened that put at 95 and price hit 102 so i was up 8 i set a 2 trailing stop limit purposefully set it at 2 to limit slip well it triggered of course at 10 premium however tos didn t fill me till 94 of course im pissed off and contact them why i have nearly $1 of slippage on a contract like that when i was green and all they could tell me was that that s just how market orders work perhaps you should try a limit order never time to be honest i have been pretty much over tos tda crap lately and its only getting worse they truly don t care about their customers anymore but that s a discussion for another time overall a good day despite the fill issue looking forward to a possibly better trend or at least wider range day to get some better trades tomorrow too see you guys tomorrow youtube will be up later

think loan forgiveness will cost taxpayers a lot the fed hold my beer $1t according to a policy brief by andrew levin and bill nelson qe4 will cost taxpayers nearly a $1t over the next decade andrew levin is a professor of monetary economics at dartmouth with numerous prior roles at the fed board bill nelson is a professor at georgetown and chief economist of the bank policy institute with an expertise in bank liquidity the amplereserves regime floor system of managing interbank lending of blasting banks with excess reserves seemingly worked fine during zirp however the expense to service all this excess liquidity is turning out to be incredibly costly where does the cost come from in order to service the massive liquidity created by qe4 the fed can only control interest rates with a floor system of providing extremely generous payments to banks via reserves iorb interest on reserve balances and the rrp facility aka reverse repos it is essentially a bribe to keep the federal funds rate from freefalling back to 0 or potentially even negative the result fed will operate at a loss for the first time in history and by suspending payments to the treasury it will cost taxpayers nearly $1t over the next decade money printing with qe involves buying bonds that eventually mature and sucks money back from circulation in some sense it is a loose metaphor currently the fed is actually printing dollars out of thin air with no oversight all of this done with zero warning of the magnitude of risks and zero approval by congress the beautiful part this doesn t even include the extra cost to taxpayers of higher rates being required to tame inflation and thereby increasing borrowing costs that are being artificially propped up the fed is not alone in this reckless irresponsibility this is happening to every major cb across the world tldr in 2023 the fed is creating a precedent that it can borrow unlimited funds from the american taxpayer with no set maturity or repayment date with zero warning to the public discussion of benefits vs costs or approval from congress edit what is the floor system it is a new way that the fed along with cb s around the world began managing interest rates during the gfc

disney is undervalued heading into the second half of 2022 as summer approaches the park will be a make up year for all those who couldn t get out the last few years in 2021 the walt disney company held assets worth a total of over 20361 billion us dollars this includes the rights to the ufc non ppv espn national geographic and so many more i think of all this the most important thing will be the rumors of how disney is moving forward a new rumor claims the top priority at disney that will affect marvel and star wars is to remove sjw employees as the top executives have realized that go woke go broke is not just a slogan if they can manage to cleanse the toxicity which they are now planning to do mixed with parks this summer teaching peak levels this company could easily reach $175200 this isn t even accounting for how brutal the market has been and the rebound i believe will happen sooner than later have a great weekend
esg is choking civilization to death i m of the opinion that people are becoming increasingly aware of how dangerous these policies are since i last posted this and am now gonna take a temperature read again from general perspective of this forum to see if sentiment is changing original post esg fallacies and their dangers esg policy is a fallacy and proving to be a very destructive one at that all modes of energy are interconnected and dependent on one another whether we like that fact or not they are all slices on the same pie the goal should be to utilize all forms in their respective slices not to get rid of them we have to use what we got and change the percentage size of each slice accordingly when it s possible to do so safely and effectively as nations we do not have a perfect world and oil and coal are used in countless ways and it s not going anywhere possibly ever the best that can be done with the less savory forms of energy is make better technologies to lessen their downsides and start incorporating better forms to take over when feasible nuclear is a phenomenal source of energy that i m deeply and i say again deeeeeply invested in and should take up most of the energy source pie in the future and i m confident this is happening but we need all of what we have in way of energy sources and to not get ahead of ourselves with political hyperbole sexy sounding sales pitches on utopian futures can get things into dark places both literally and figuratively when they lose touch with reality and the reality is we need all these forms of energy at the moment and to act like they can be discarded overnight is dangerously foolish also if nuclear isn t already the leader of the esg movement and discussion how legitimate are these policies and agendas anyway i m of the opinion esg policy and investing put us at the brink of a dark age for the past 5 years and i m now of the opinion that they have succeeded in pushing us into an energy dark age amongst other things edit i m positioned heavy in oil natural gas coal and uranium i would argue i m shorting esg investing in an abstract kind of way

capital one financial corp cof a deep dive into potential bearish indicators hello fellow traders i ve been conducting an indepth analysis on capital one financial corporation cof and have stumbled upon several intriguing data points that seem to imply a potentially bearish trend here is what i ve pieced together 1 credit card debt exposure capital one s exposure to credit card debt is quite significant as of the end of 2022 they held $138 billion in credit card loans which accounted for around 44 of their total loan portfolio given this heavy exposure any uptick in defaults or borrowing costs could severely impact the company s stability in a hypothetical moderate recession there is a possibility that capital one s cet1 ratio may plummet and the company s balance sheet equity value could see a reduction by half or even more 2 us credit card debt trends credit card debt in the united states skyrocketed to an unprecedented $9306 billion in q4 of 2022 additionally there has been an increase in delinquencies with credit card annual percentage rates averaging near 20 and potentially rising further this development is worrisome particularly as consumers are increasingly reliant on credit to manage the soaring costs of basic necessities such as groceries and rent 3 congressional stock trading noteworthy trades involving cof by members of congress have been reported specifically representative french hill offloaded cof shares multiple times in may 2023 4 lobbying expenditure in the first quarter of 2023 capital one expended $630 000 on lobbying efforts chiefly on banking finance and tax matters this raises the question if they are seeking to sway legislation in an attempt to cushion potential risks 5 insider trading a trend has emerged of more cof shares being sold than purchased by insiders for instance on june 2 2023 mouadeb mark daniel sold 469 shares and on february 14 2023 blinde neal unloaded 8000 shares 6 legislative developments legislation such as the credit card competition act of 2022 have been introduced which could carry ramifications for the credit card industry and specifically for cof while these data points are far from conclusive they certainly raise some red flags i would love to hear your insights on this matter how do you interpret these data points do you believe that these factors could precipitate a bearish trajectory for cof and most importantly why isn t it bearish yet
food industry companies s profits will decline sharply with the new weightloss drugs becoming more popular and accessible mounjaro wegovy and ozempic are new weightloss drugs that really work for weight loss by basically reducing your appetite which means people eat less it seems also that these new weightloss drugs affect people s taste buds so companies may need to recreate their foods recipes to accomodates new people s taste as more and more people will take these drugs in the future for now they re pricey but probably governements will make these drugs more accessible to people since reducing obesity will cut a lot of health s costs and also increasing productivity also since more studies are linking maternal obesity to a decrease of cognitive functions in boys policymakers will be even more interested since it means that fighting obesity will also improve education outcomes and therefore job prospects for the men of the future the drop in food industry companies profits probably won t happen soon because these drugs aren t so accessible but i can see it starting to happen 5 years from now the food industry and weight loss industry are really going to be affected by these new drugs can t deny i m excited to see how things will develope edit at 412 pm cet 08 february 2023 the food industry that i think will be hit are the sugar and junk food industries the biggest food companies will thrive while the little ones will suffer the consumers decrease in appetite link between maternal obesity and decrase of iq scores in boys not in girls sources

why i m not playing logi earnings tonight logitech international logi is going to be reporting earning later today after market close the consensus eps estimate is 40 cents per share and the consensus revenue estimate is $92018m both these numbers suggest a significant decline year over year according to seeking alpha eps estimates have seen 0 upward revisions and 6 downward revisions over the last 3 months revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 5 downward factors to consider so as of right now you re probably thinking of getting puts right well let s actually consider why this decline is happening logitech s fiscal fourthquarter earnings are likely to have been negatively impacted by the declining demand for personal computers pcs the main sales booster for its pc peripheral products per the latest international data corporation report worldwide pc shipments declined 29 year over year to 569 million units in the first quarter of 2023 in 2020 and 2021 logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its video collaboration keyboards combos and pointing device tools mainly driven by the heightening of workfromhome and learnfromhome trends due to the rise in popularity of esports and online video games during this time period the market for gaming products also experienced a sharp increase however the demand softened due to the reopening of economic and business activities in the most recent reported quarter the company saw a dramatic fall in sales across all of its product categories in the previous quarter revenues from the pointing devices pc webcams tablet and other accessories audio wearables keyboards combos video collaboration mobile speakers and gaming product categories plunged 138 492 214 337 219 212 325 and 165 respectively additionally enterprises are postponing their large it spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues this may have hurt logitech s overall financial performance in the fiscal fourth quarter however reduced operating expenses are likely to have partially offset the negative impacts of the aforementioned factors on profitability so what to do for earnings considering all the factors above it seems like puts might be a nobrainer keep in mind the stock will drop only if the release is lower than expected and everyone is expecting very low numbers this being said since the stock is up 2 today puts are on a discount so it honestly wouldn t hurt to buy a spread just for fun however the option chain is very illiquid the volume on the 55 60p is only 29 so i won t be buying puts or calls or anything there s a lot of other earning plays i plan on posting so be sure to catch those tomorrow morning we have uber and pfe and later this week a couple more big ones keep in mind tho this is not financial or investment advice this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction

opinion the fed and major central banks are the main cause of the oncoming recession firstly the fed and major central banks are raising interest rates to combat inflation but raising interest rates to combat inflation only works when the problem is on the demand side of things due to covid and the russiaukraine war the cause of inflation is purely down to supply so effectively the fed raising interest rates will only have negative impacts on the economy without actually bringing down inflation on cue companies are starting to announce lay offs whereas before the rates started hiking the labour marke was tight and thriving the fed and other central banks raising rates have led organisations and consumers to believe hard times are ahead consequently businesses are cutting costs and consumers not spending as much central banks have very limited tools in terms of how to deal with inflation other than raising interest rates however due to the nature of this inflation it s pretty clear that this isn t going to work regardless central banks have decided to cause a recession by raising rates as opposed to letting inflation keep increasing but what is worse a recession where people lose their homes and their jobs due to central bank attitude to spending or a strong economy where the labour market is solid but we all have to pay a bit extra for every day things obviously none of the ideas is ideal but central banks are choosing the by far most destructive option in my opinion my question is why i d be keen to hear other people s thoughts

if you think sag will get what they re asking for short nflx i am in the industry fwiw hypothetically netflix nflx could be left in a rather precarious position should the screen actors guild sag emerge victorious from their prolonged clash and attain their soughtafter objectives the core issue that beckons our contemplation is the foreseen escalation in production costs a consequence of sag s potentially successful campaign for enhanced compensation and improved working conditions for thespian talents the heart of netflix s allure resides in its prolific creation of original content it s an arena where they have staked a substantial claim consistently wowing audiences with a diverse array of offerings however if sag s demands are met this narrative could alter significantly picture a scenario where the payout to writers significantly inflates and the benchmarks for working conditions become loftier the immediate consequence is an augmentation in production expenses that could spiral out of control now let s dissect the repercussions of these burgeoning costs margin squeeze a ballooning budget for content production is likely to exert immense pressure on netflix s profit margins as they strive to satiate the demands of both shareholders and contenthungry subscribers there might be a disconcerting erosion of profitability competitive stagnation in the intensely competitive arena of streaming where netflix faces a relentless barrage from amazon prime video disney hbo max and a host of other contenders a sudden surge in production costs could leave netflix lagging in the race to secure and retain subscribers they d be constrained in their ability to offer competitive pricing or to fund further innovative content this hits affects nflx disproportionately because streaming is their only business furthermore they rely on newlyproduced original content to a greater degree than other services quality conundrum netflix s brand has been inexorably tied to the quality of its original productions if sag s victory necessitates budgetary restraint the perilous question emerges can they sustain the caliber of content that has endeared them to subscribers worldwide a decline in quality could precipitate viewer dissatisfaction and attrition let us foster discourse and exchange perspectives for it is in the crucible of collective intellect that we may glean the most sagacious insights however heed this counsel consult a financial sage or undertake exhaustive research before embarking on any investment odyssey discuss

b of a bank just announced stop buying our stock in a bear market it s just gonna make it worse the recent recovery in stocks may be shortlived according to bank of america securities which sees a bear market setting in through 2022 and suggests that investors tilt to cash and commodities bofa laid out a witches brew of negative trends signals and data points in a note published thursday by chief investment strategist michael hartnett and his team if it walks like a bear it probably is they write more than 75 of stocks in the nasdaq composite and 51 of sp 500 stocks are already in a bear marketdown more than 20 from peak prices hartnett notes the outlook is worsening with geopolitical risks exacerbating potential for inflation higher commodity prices and shocks to growth negative real interest rates adjusted for inflation areanother ominous sign going back 250 years negative rates have been synonymous with crashes panics andwars he notes hartnett also calls out signs of cracking in retail and homebuilding pointing out that home depot hd stock is down 29 from its peak while builders such as toll brothers are off 38 the declines imply cracks in consumer spending which rarely happens outside recessions he notes and the federal reserve far from riding to the rescue with market stimulus is tightening the noose planning to raise rates and withdraw liquidity to try to quell inflation we re bearish hartnett writes adding that inflation shocks will ripple through to rate hikes and lower growth resulting in negative returns for corporate bonds and stocks in 2022
uk brokers no longer offering us etfs hello it s my first post on the platform and i am looking for some advice i have been using ig for trading us securities for quite some time didn t face any sig issues until yesterday when i found that you can t trade us etfs anymore because of some fsca rule that prevents retail investors from trading securities that do not provide kiids i wanted to buy sqqq having closed my position a few weeks ago and wanted to ride the volatility wagon again and to my surprise all my attempts kept getting rejected on enquiring i asked how that is possible when all the key fund related information fact sheets are provided on proshares website and the response i got back was that the document needs to be literally titled kiid to qualify i found this bizzare when all the kiid info is readily available in other documents which brings me to my questions has anyone faced a similar issue recently are there any retail friendly platforms in the uk that are super attractive for trading us securities and etfs super grateful for any help thanks

statistical probabilities of cpi days i posted an article i wrote this weekend about the last 4 months of cpi data it actually gives a 75 odds of a bull run tomorrow and a 50 odds we see 15 green day tomorrow there is a 25 chance we see greater then 17 red day though yesterday had a 75 chance of being red and it did finish red the day of cpi has a 75 chance of finishing red and the day after cpi has a 75 chance of finishing red and a 100 chance of finishing redder than 13 if it s a red day 25 chance we finish 115 there is a 50 chance we go on a bull run vs a bear run for the two weeks after cpi is released so far that is proving to be beyond accurate as we are already opening at 15 right now so statistically we should see a dump tomorrow so the question would be do we buy puts at market close today or what do we do well lets look at the last 4 days of cpi data its actually interesting january 12th 027 1015am dump x200b february 10th 18 1030am dump x200b march 10th 045 dump at 1015 x200b april 12th 037 dump at 10am x200b x200b there is essentially a 100 chance we dump at 10151030am tomorrow now the one thing is that this cpi is the first time we will see the feds predicting a drop in cpi not a rise so perhaps we break this trend but if we cpi misses huge shes finna dip as you can see april cpi we rallied like crazy but i really relate us mostly to cpi release in march i will most likely be opening a small put play at market close tonight

keep your eyes peeled for uranium stocks guys prepare i predict that the next big speculative move will be on uranium watch closely ux futures and uranium related stocks ccj uec big buying volumes are already in but the bigger market ignores it in europe ecofreaks have established absurd energy politics and with the war in ucraine and a world which wants everything to be electric i do think that blackouts are not far away some of the most industrialised countries like germany are buying nuclear power from neighbour countries france however it has been already forecasted that this amount of energy could not be sufficient to meet the demand for both countries we are talking about middleage scenarios like regions without energy no way to pay with credit card cash only if supermarkets have energy it is highly discussed that during winter 2023 there will be blackouts in europe companies telling you how long you are allowed to use electricity making the whole smart working thin air when something common like electricity becomes scarce the only answer today which can account for massive energy ouput is nuclear i am not talking about your ridiculous shithole where you live i am talking about industries big scale transportation trains etc keep your eyes peeled on uranium and atomic energy related stocks timeframe 1224 months godspeed

i think isrg intuitive surgical will start tanking and so buying puts is my play please read there are only 2 fda apprvd surgical robots put s timeline late mid 20242026 i am correlating this with competitors release of their 20 version called luna more at very end of post pics and timeline my initial position starting slow looking for good deals but i bought jan 17th 2025 expiry pt of 9500 for 120 x200b im buyingbought $isrg puts only two surgical robots approved by the fda intuitive surgical $isrg enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause a second ever contender was fda approved now it s post pandemic and it s on like donkey kong intuitive and another one that is super low market cap wsb bot won t let me post name without deleting my post due to it s market cap but it s interesting to note that despite it s small market cap it is completely debt free and has powerful investors board seat members like andrea biffi from sofar an italian pharma heavy weight now ma dmerger aquisitioned by an even larger pharma alfasigma the largest pharmaceutical company in italy so i wont name it but i believe this small market cap contender will eventually cause isrg to tumble and thus making isrg a juicy short within the next year it s close to 300 bucks right now so i m buying puts on isrg intuitive has super crappy technology vs recently fda approved competitor competitor of intuitive is less expensive and has re usable tools haptic feedback for surgeon eyetracking camera google cloud healthcare ai and nvidia partnership 1 more on google health care ai cloud colab competitor has had a formal collab since february of this year note what ashima gupta global director of healthcare for google ai cloud said back then 2 note what director said in today s 10923 press release to cnbc these are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out you can t be adding friction to it gupta told cnbc in an interview we are very cautious of that that we are respecting the surface they use that the workflow doesn t change but yet they get the power of this technology link to today s press release where quote is from other press release links that have googl up today note the hospitals that are part of googles first release for beta release are the same hospitals with senhances surgical robots mayo clinic and hackensak please note that the competitor is working to upload live video and picures and all kinds of datasets for ai and ai search for healthcare field competitor has senhances worldwide with over 10 000 procedures and like tesla s record driver data and add it to nueralink the same happens with each senhance that each surgeon drives and google nvidia competitor are getting all surgical dataset gold very likely google will pay senhance creators a royalty to competitor of isrg the fact is isrg is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab when you see videos links below you will see hackensack and you will also see pic of mayo clinic pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago see below for pics and links for further inforesearchdd intuitive surgical $isrg eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th 10th 12th or max 18th surgical proceduredepending on the tool robotic tip yes you read that correct every 18th surgical procedure the bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and unsustainable eye gauging vs competitor whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool one surgical robot surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the competitor for over 3 yearsplease googlei have links belowbut you can google for yourselves also if you like carlos mendoza herrera master surgeon from cedar sinai in chicago also google amit travedi hackensack medical hospital carlos mendoza herrera sinai chicago links below notice picturealso notice the open cockpit design of competitor vs isrg isrg surgical robot da vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine then you need to stare through two more holes while on senhance from competitor you keep a clear line of sight sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff and stare a beautiful screen that s in front of you competitor to isrg currently has a formal google healthcare cloud agreement since february and another formal agreement with juggernaut nvidia anounced much more recentlysee pics below mayo clinic recently added the competitors surgical robot over da vinci becuase of all the aformentioned plus isrg does not have 3mm ports in other words 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate and so after surgical procedure you don t have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from but literally a 3mm cut maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from an inch is 25mm to give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can t handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest isrg has isrg will take years to get fda approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen also isrg will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested things the competitor already has fda approved and in the market as the mayo clinic recently showed isrg in their monopolistic comfort rested on it s laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they $isrg gave them now they re caught flat footed a little deviation on what is laparoscopy and why robotic surgery is an evolution to that so the question i keep asking myself is why hasn t isrg come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly because they ve never really needed to improve their lower tier tech because there literally was no other alternative than them this led to massive abuse on their part more on that below lawsuits and unhappy hospitals and medical centers all robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from so your up and running faster with less pain and can return to work family your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long that cuts through muscle tendons perhaps bones please see video links below for more explanation on this they are short videos like 25 minutes long laparoscopy was the manual way of minimally invasive surgery meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually obviously this is a challenging form of surgery but under skilled surgeons extremely successful with robotic surgery you have the steady hand tremor free you re able to sit down through out the process and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries ergo more successful and safer surgeries perhaps one after the other plus software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentallysomething not avail with manual laparascopy something isrg does not have but senhance does see lawsuits link below also measuring distances between organs etc can be done with software vs inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the roboticsbut still done with isrg also articulated instruments inside the abdomen add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems these are the advantages of robotic surgeriy over manual minimally invasive laparoscopic surgeries so robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy manaual laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b x200b isrg tries to scrub their lawsuits on the internet but no die several still to find hospitals fighting isrg monopoly here s an excerpt from above link of the monopolistic bully tactics isrg has used throughout the years to maintain their monopolistic revenues when you have had zero competition any enterprise will earn substantial revenues in a market with zero competition especially for over two decades excerpt these are real lawsuits driving the news in one allegation a hospital says intuitive surgical remotely shut down a hospital s surgical robot in the middle of a procedure which forced the surgeon to convert the procedure to open surgery with the patient on the operating table after the hospital said it was considering a service contract with a third party lawsuits many of the most recent da vinci settlements have come from malpractice suits against surgeons for example in 2021 a 56yearyear old man received a $700 000 settlement after he sued his surgeon for cutting a hepatic duct during a da vinciassisted gallbladder procedure looks like this surgeon could have benefited from the no fly zone software senhance has to avoid robot arms accidentally harming interior organs during operation that isrg lacks hospitals in japan and germany and usanow the mayo clinic as of last week using senhance over da vinci why didn t the mayo clinic simply get another da vinci for their pediatrics because da vinci lacks 3mm ports for small infants and children senhance has had recent pediatric fda approval example cost saving for hospitals and medical centerssenhance $4170da vinci $7675 4 same surgery surgeons that use senhance 1 amit trivedi 1 master surgeon carlo s sandoval herrera 2 youtube links a live german symposium with a live senhance surgery happening in the backgroudn that doctors discuss i suggest you watch it and tun on cc and choose your preffered language also please watch this video and pay special attention what this surgeon says at 30second time stamp of two minute video 3 free to see watch what other american surgeons have to say of senhance vs da vinciamit trivedi hackansack new jersey hospital 4 carlos herrera sandoval from sinai chicago hospital master surgeon carlos herrera sandoval how the mayo clinic explains the benefits of a robotic surgery before they went with senhance last week note the same hospital where carlos works at but this is another doctor listen very carefully how this surgeons discribes the ports and the how he uses his fingers to help the view understand just what he is talking about luna is the 20 from competitor and will deal the final blow based on latest cantor fitzgerald healthcare expo about a week ago coo mentioned they had a clear 510 clearance for luna the 20 iteration to senhance please note competitor has an excellent track record in getting fda approvals 3mm port pediatrics jnj stryker titan medical ge have all tried with their massive market caps and resources to get their robots fda approved to compete in this juicy market and only one has been able to do it so this competitor with a lower market cap is a strong contender with strong alliances that make it a massive sledge hammer for isrg i highly suggest you watch the fireside between cantor fitzgerald and coo of competitor and how they talk about their essentially secured 510k basically an upgrade to an already open cockpit design vs how other competitors from europe have been rejected to watch fireside chat between competitor and cantor go to competitor website and go under events go to competitors website and click on investors and then presentations and events it will be the latest top event date sept 26 2023 cantor global healthcare conference watch timestamp 2237 entire video is like 24 minutes long x200b x200b timeline for luna commercial availability under an assured 510k from fda x200b i do think it $isrg will tank so that s why i m posting on why i believe isrg will bite the dust soon enough and letting you guys know about it it s a big thick juicy short over 200 hundred bucks close to 300 bucks a share and short puts are relatively inexpensive right now not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book very manageable price my view is it took tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena there were several cars people could choose from here there s only two in the entire vast market of surgeries which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized robotics so either isrg stops resting on it s monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot like ford gm chryslerstellantis has by tesla another fun fact toyota it took them 26 years to become profitable my point this is literally a two man market competitor and isrg and one is lagging with tech and customer satisfaction and treatment while the other is excelling i ll be editing the post as time goes by with any further news or updates i hope you guys pitch in too in the comments x200b 10 000 plus procedures have been performed worldwide by senhances google it link has bot term but here is the pic x200b update to post news today 101123 for california state right to repari your own equipment seems pretty broad and looking like it could cover da vinci machines meaning isrg cannot force out a third party maintenance repair which is more hits to their monopolistic bottom line more

fed is lying next rate hike i think jerome powel is bluffing about his last rate hike in november or december why first we are heading into a recession and the unemployment rate is beginning to go up more rate hikes could damage a little bit more the economy with the lag effect there is always a delay second maybe this last rate hike is already priced in by the market and that would mean if he s hiking one last time markets could sore because that would mean powel is done the fight with inflation is over the fed does not want the market soaring he needs to keep a restrictive psychology so i think there will be no more rate hikes this year and will be forced to cut in 2024 as a recession starts to degrade the economy

the over glorified tech guy elon musk i believe elon musk is one over glorified guy that happened to had been bailed out by the us gov when his project was going down in addition accumulating massive audience on twitter things started to go up his head he is definitely a master of mass manipulation and psychology but took one wrong turn by buying twitter which is the most crappiest transaction in the history of trades tesla s fundamentals haven t changed it s still intact however and unfortunately elon may have lost his marbles by playing childish meme posting over twitter which hurt tesla stock in return i think this prick needs to focus on tesla rather than posting meaningless shit over twitter

are we about to see massive debt default sorry this isn t funny curious what people here think are we about to enter an age of massive debt default we ve got these massive labor shortages but i don t know how people have been surviving for a year or more is everybody living on credit cards are we going to see massive consumer defaults and bankruptcy when those credit lines run out i see credit usage is way up but not enough to support a whole society staying home so maybe i m missing something if we are about to enter a period of massive debt default is there a way to invest to take advantage of that
why starbucks is losing to luckin coffee in china and why this likely won t change with luckin s 2nd quarter earnings report it s impactful partnership with moutai and soon with victoria secret luckin coffee is making headlines for all the right reasons yesterday s cnbc headline how luckin coffee overtook starbucks as the largest coffee chain in china is turning even more heads as unbiased investors looking for opportunities it s worth trying to understand where starbucks lost ground and why luckin is succeeding starbucks has numerous disadvantages in china starbucks stores are largely in hightier cities so when covid struck and these cities were being shut down so too were more starbucks while luckin coffee does have stores in hightier cities they ve largely targeted lowertier cities major problem for starbucks prior to covid starbucks didn t have a well developed app for order and delivery luckin already did so while starbucks was playing catchup luckin was expanding and building market share major problem for starbucks starbucks stores are larger and designed to have a 3rd space luckin stores are small and efficiently designed for pickup and delivery so not only is starbucks paying more for their realestate but it costs more money and time to create a new store in other words starbucks can t keep up with luckin s growth both in speed and the cost of development major problem for starbucks luckin s selection of drinks cater more to chinese tastes luckin is vertically integrated in china so they can reduce their prices and still profit starbucks is seen as a luxury brand so they can t reduce their prices too much without losing their identity as a luxury brand over a year ago luckin passed starbucks in store count now they ve passed them in revenue what can t be forgotten is china s unique marketplace for coffee it is literally the fastest growing coffee market in the world in starbucks entire history they have never opened the number of stores luckin has in one year even globally this isn t a knock on starbucks they deserve a great deal of credit for helping to develop the global coffee market but the western coffee market is a mature one and slow growing meanwhile in china things are just getting started some of what i ve listed above starbucks might be able to fix but not all of it going forward i believe starbucks will continue to lose market share to luckin coffee making luckin the better investment for investors

house music as an economic signal back in the 2008 recession there was a surge in house music production with many pop songs heading toward faster bpms this tempo acceleration is actually decently documented showing that during times of economic hardship the average bpm of popular music tends to increase during our last recession this was exemplified by artists like the black eyed peas lady gaga rihanna nicki minaj etc now it would seem we are headed in a similar direction given the discoheavy influences of a ton of current pop music think dua lipa the weeknd and doja cat most recently beyonce s new track and drake s new album both artists have been able to stay in the charts for decades and just so happened to release househeavy tracks within the past month that s not to say we are definitely in for a long recession but i think it s fun to think about what do y all think

could high inflation cause a creditfreeze banks around the world have to deal with very inflation they have to lend money for basically negativ interest rates which means lending makes them lose money to make money they have to lend for higher interestrates but this causes another problem who can afford to borrow for such high interestrates i guess only few but with decreasing inflows of repayments decreasing values of their collaterals and increasing defaults how will the creditmarket react if the creditmarket becomes aware of these risks fear could cascade and freeze up the creditmarket causing a big sell off in stocks and others stores of value just so the credit market stays liquide what do you think

stormy waters technical analysis reveals bearish patterns in the banking sector impact of the banking crisis recession fears high valuations and interest rate hikes on banks price action the banking sector is currently facing a number of challenges including the risk of recession high valuations interest rate hikes and fears of inflation these challenges are reflected in the price action of many banks which are currently expressing bearish patterns technical analysis of multiple banks reveals that many are currently presenting bearish patterns such as head and shoulders double tops and ascending channels the stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient warren buffett a sector in crisis one factor contributing to the bearish sentiment in the banking sector is the ongoing banking crisis which has been brought on by multiple bank failures and concerns about the stability of the financial system this crisis has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and tighter lending standards which are putting pressure on banks profitability and growth prospects additionally fears of a recession are also weighing on the banking sector a recession would likely lead to increased loan defaults and reduced demand for banking services which could further erode banks earnings and asset quality high valuations are another headwind for the banking sector many banks are currently trading at relatively high pricetoearnings ratios which suggests that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth however if earnings fail to meet these expectations investors may begin to sell off bank stocks leading to further declines in price finally interest rate hikes are also a challenge for banks higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses which can reduce demand for loans and other banking services additionally higher rates can also put pressure on banks net interest margins which can reduce their profitability technical analysis it all started with an article on morgan stanley as usual i was curious to see what kind of trajectory their stock was on with a tendency of being contrarian and q1 bank earnings coming up i decided to do an analysis of some of the major banks to see how they may be affected by the current banking crisis usually i expect price action to be in line with major data points and headlines in the hopes of finding discrepancies it is these discrepancies that highlight opportunities in markets what kind of discrepancies do we look for 1 fundamental discrepancies traders might look for discrepancies between the fundamental analysis of a company and its current market valuation for example if a company s fundamentals suggest that it is undervalued but its stock price is declining this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock 2 market condition discrepancies traders might look for discrepancies between the current market conditions and the direction of a stock s price for example if the market is bullish but a stock s price is declining this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock expecting it to rebound as the market recovers 3 technical analysis discrepancies traders might look for discrepancies between the technical analysis of a stock s price chart and its current market valuation for example if a stock s price chart shows a bullish trend but its current market valuation so what do we see morgan stanley an m top is a bearish chart pattern that occurs in technical analysis it is characterized by two peaks that form a letter m shape on a price chart the pattern occurs when a stock or asset price reaches a high point then pulls back to a support level before rising again to a similar high point however instead of breaking through this resistance level the price falls sharply creating an m shape on the chart a break of a trendline occurs when the price of an asset moves below or above the trendline indicating a potential reversal in the trend a break of a trendline can be significant because it can signal a shift in market sentiment with buyers or sellers gaining control of the market for example if a stock has been in an uptrend and then breaks below its trendline this could indicate that the buying pressure has decreased and the stock price may start to fall conversely if a stock has been in a downtrend and then breaks above its trendline this could signal a reversal in the trend and a potential buying opportunity an ascending channel consists of two parallel trend lines with the upper trend line connecting the highs and the lower trend line connecting the lows the upper trend line acts as resistance while the lower trend line acts as support as long as the price stays within the channel it is said to be in an uptrend if the price of an asset breaks below the lower border of an ascending channel it can indicate a potential trend reversal a break below the lower border can be seen as a sign of weakness in the uptrend and could signal a shift in market sentiment toward bearishness jp morgan chase co in technical analysis a head and shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs on a price chart it is formed when a stock or asset price rises to a peak then declines to a support level before rising again to a higher peak the left shoulder the price then declines again to the same support level before rising once more to a higher peak the head finally the price declines again to the support level before rising once more to a lower peak the right shoulder the head and shoulders pattern is significant because it indicates that the bulls buyers have failed to push the price higher and the bears sellers have gained control of the market when the price falls below the support level it confirms the pattern and signals a potential reversal in the trend other bearish signals that can be seen described above in the chart are an ascending channel bearish and two trendline breaks bearish when the trendline is broken to the downside third time s the charm goldman sachs technical patterns ascending channel and m formation both bearish have already been described above bank of america technicals include bearish ascending channels with trendline breaks there is even a faint head and shoulders pattern at the end of the most recent price action conclusion in conclusion technical analysis of multiple banks suggests that the banking sector is currently facing significant headwinds including the ongoing banking crisis fears of a recession high valuations and interest rate hikes there has also been a recent slowdown in lending due to the recent credit crunch which you can read about in my previous post the basis of most banks revenue models these challenges are reflected in the bearish price action of many banks which are currently in a downtrend and forming bearish patterns as always investors should conduct their own research and analysis before making any investment decisions and carefully manage their risk

daily thread for tomorrow reddit was down so no thread come hang in discord instead
alarm signals in bank reports i continue to discuss banks as nearly all the reports presented today have surprisingly exceeded expectations here s a brief overview of the numbers and what i m paying attention to 1 bank of america bac revenue reached $263 billion surpassing the forecast of $2525 billion earnings per share eps were $097 higher than the expected $081 the bank s deposit volume decreased by almost 8 to $19 trillion and the bank also lowered its forecast for interest income income from deposits loans issued etc 2 goldman sachs gs revenue totaled $122 billion falling short of the $1283 billion forecast eps was $879 exceeding the $824 expectation revenue decreased by 5 yearoveryear and eps dropped by 183 in the future the bank may increase income due to the newly announced apple savings account which will generates 415 annual interest 3 bank of ny mellon bk one of the oldest banks in the us reported revenue of $44 billion and an eps of $112 in line with market expectations revenue increased by 11 yearoveryear partly due to a 52 rise in net interest income and eps grew by 30 however the volume of assets under management declined by 16 to $19 trillion due to market influence ie client asset withdrawal still the reports are far from ideal news and the market seems to agree bank of america was up 2 in premarket but has since lost around about 07 from yesterday s close goldman sachs is down approximately 15 bank of ny mellon has reduced losses and now sees a 025 increase sp 500 index futures are hovering around the zero mark while gold has risen adding 07 however the market is currently highly volatile and so the picture may change by the close of trading conclusion as i mentioned earlier credit institutions are unanimously stating that they re cutting costs and increasing return on capital simultaneously the banking crisis that began with the silicon valley bank story is already causing deposit outflows and other challenges as a result banks need to increase loan reserves therefore i prefer to stay away from bank stocks for now i might consider taking partial profits in the spdr sp bank etf kbe us today in the current situation it s better to secure a small profit from the transaction than to wait and see where things end up and of course there are several intriguing ideas that i ll lay out in much more detail very very soon

bullish on nvda after intel guidance as many of you know the intel guidance dropped and it s had an impact on nvda and amd respectively the issue here is that intels drop in demand is for specifically for chips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets that is to say nothing to do with the ai chips that nvda and amd are building on their inventory which the hype is blasting off of in a separate statement the ceo goes on to say that they expect $2 billion worth of orders for its ai chips and expects better sales later in the year who gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying the future is ai the drop we re seeing in aftermarket for both nvda and amd is unrelated to what they are producing compared to intel with nvda expecting 20 billion in revenue it s absurd to correlate the dying performance of one company with the stellar sales of another now i understand the market is irrational and there will most likely be a dip on open but it really don t make any sense to me the loss in revenue from intel is correlated with the absurd growth nvidia has been having with a 11 trillion valuation the computing power and software to boot i think if anything a decline in intel should be a sign of the absurd market dominance nvda has
