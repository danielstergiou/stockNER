boeing will fly high tomorrow $ba boeing will go up 510 after their earnings report case 1 the 737door scandal was solely due to human error not all of the bolts were used on the door nor were the bolts properly tightened thus causing the door to rip off the plane midflight we are talking about one case people one case but the media loves to criticize boeing whenever anything happens the company is under a magnifying glass prior to earnings this is intentional to drive the stock down at a cheaper price for big players to scoop up shares at a discount like me case 2 there are rumors that alaskan air is going to cancel its order for the 737 however that s all it isa rumor nobody in this industry actually believes that flights have already resumed normal operations and china has announced that they will be buying more boeing planes case 3 boeing has announced a safety investigation on its assembly line they have hired a top executive to lead this investigation but you have to reverseanalyze what this actually means the truth is that if boeing were expecting to report an earnings loss they would not have initiated a safety commission consider the opportunity cost of running such an investigation because they have made so much money they realize they can afford to allocate funds to this investigation even if it may seem unnecessary just to appease the media and get them off their backs case 4 wall street has not fully grasped the situation in the middle east and the rise of various proxy wars and escalation since the october 7th attacks on our ally in the middle east in fact an article has just come out stating that the militaryindustrial complex has achieved recordhigh sales and this naturally includes boeing but no everyone is focused on omg a door came off mid flight case 5 boeing s recent stock decline is driven by emotional retail investors despite widespread concerns and rumors hedge funds anticipate a significant earnings beat once this becomes evident after boeing releases its earnings report the stock is expected to rebound strongly as sellers retreat and buyers capitalize on the undervalued opportunity case 6 finally i m just going based on vibes with that being said on the offshoot that boeing goes up north of 15 i will call my local boeing office and offer to fully fund an office pizza party edit to the guy who posted the bearish boeing post shortly after me you are the true regard not me you or watch theta gang kill us both

market and public is grossly misunderstanding and overestimating the impact of feds action first of all with all the talk about tightening we are barely at 125and the goal seems to be around 225 what kind of tightening is that 25 is still extremely low historically speaking how about tapering and reducing the balance sheet well that may sound scary but all the fed is doing is slowly unwinding by stopping to add new assets to the balance sheet they are not really unloading much at all now even if the fed decided to unload it 23 of the balance sheet is just treasury that s pointless so how about the remaining 13 that s about just under $3 trillion in asset the market can easily absorb it there is so much money sitting on the sideline there is over $2 trillion parked in overnight repo and let s not forget the $35 trillion that s sitting in cash in 401k retirement funds that s about to enter the marketed by early july that s over $5 trillion in liquidity that banks hedge funds retirement funds have that are ready to buy i think the market is overestimating the impact of feds current action
121622 spy es futures and tesla weekly market recap and analysis well while not all history repeats itself the history of quad witching days opening pretty red continues however this one is the first quad witching day of 2022 that did not close higher than its opening price i was able to secure a nice profit on a 0dte am spx contract this morning i really anticipated today to turn around more than it did but instead we ended up with a very bloody day and an eod shorts covering rally x200b because i like to find trends in this market i did assess to see if there was an correlation with the monday following quad witching day and there really is not two of the three quad days closed green for a 667 probability that monday closes green one opened big green one opened big red and one opened flat so there really is no telling what mondays opening will bring but we could expect a green close x200b yesterday i mentioned that today felt oddly similar to the september leading quad witching time period interestingly enough from the peak of monday september 12th till the bottom of friday september 16th quad witching day we had about a 72 drop from tuesday december 13th cpi day to today friday december 16th quad witching day we had about a 72 drop from high to low in price action if we look at the monday following septembers quad day we saw a nice deep red open at 09 however spy rallied to close at 078 the biggest difference here is that the week following quad witching was cpi week does that mean we see a red open and a rally or without fomc and really no big news events after a massive 72 drop from the opening on cpi day to the lowest part of today are we finally going to see a bounce well if we take a look at the daily candle while hard to see cause of the black trend line it is actually a dragonfly doji candle which in a down trend should signal a short term bottom in addition unless spy was to open at 3779 15 or lower on monday that black 4 day drop resistance line will be broken at open this should open up the upside for spy now a taking a look at the last few days here a 15 red open doesn t sound that crazy but after 4 pretty impressive days of straight selling i would be slightly surprised to see a 5th day of selling with no relief bounce this sell off today also filled the almost month long gap at 38114 from november cpi we now have a gap to the upside from 38658 to 38789 and 39525 to 39631 while i would have suspect a bigger break down to test a stronger more established support at 380 intraday today we put in almost 25 hours of price action bouncing on around the 381 area this area established itself as strong support x200b now taking a look at the weekly chart here things are kind of a mixed bag from an interesting data stand point todays total high to low range was $2945 which makes it 2nd largest high to low range of the year next to the week of september 12th which was $2962 if you remember above i mentioned that also was the last quad witching week so the question now remains is this the short term top or did we just reconfirm support on the daily chart i mentioned that i suspected after that impressive 4 days straight of selling for a total 72 high to low drop that we should be do for some sort of relief bounce now on the weekly we have an interesting case here on one hand we did very clearly break through that 2022 bear market resistance line that s the dark thicker green line on the daily and weekly so that should signal that we are going to see a more meaningful push higher however as you can see on this daily candle there was a massive wick and we closed out an impressively large gravestone doji i said for the last two weeks and especially after fomc that until we broke the rising wedge and lost 3901 on the daily channel i was not bearish well we officially lost the rising wedge and lost 3901 losing those signaled to me that we should see a break down to that key support area of 370 to 380 which we hit today when we touched 381 however this gravestone doji on a down trend that last 3 weekly candles have made a lower low actually could signal a short term bottom and a bounce for next week i see two scenarios well maybe three the first scenario is that 381 was our local bottom and we go back to test resistance if we test 3901 which is a major daily and weekly resistance and break through then most likely we are looking at a gap fill up in the mid 390s there is a scenario where we could see another test of that 4052 to 410 area however i do not think we see that big of a breakout the second part of this scenario is that we retest 3901 resistance reconfirm it as resistance and then start our breakdown into the 370s next week the second scenario is that 41049 was the official top of this cycle and we are starting our next leg down much like the structure of the september to october breakdown if this is the start of the next leg down then i would be eye by eoy to middle of january a breakdown to the 358 to 364 support area i feel conflicted here the cpi we got this week was surprisingly very bullish and a very good reading it does show at least short term that inflation has peaked and that inflation is slowly coming down however of course it would be extremely improbable that we see a nonstop drop in inflation to the 2 target without any sort of stickiness or meaningful rebound in cpi we had fomc on wednesday which while i wouldn t say this was the most hawkish that jpow has ever been we did get a big of news in the markets that was unexpected however yesterday and today it was said that the markets already were not believing the fed and were revising their targets to the prefomc numbers i thought i had a tweet for this but i cant find it my thesis personally is that we will revisit 3901 resistance before the next leg down however if we were to come down and touch 378 support and hold that that odds of a bounce back to the 390s before a bigger sell off increases after pretty much a month of consolidating in the 390 to 405 range though this could be spy choosing a direction and the start of the next leg down this market for the last month has been so indecisive its really hard to give a concrete yes or no if you look at december 1st and december 13th those were two fake breakouts from the 390 to 405 channel only to fall right back into them while november 17th did touch support right at 3901 we have not had a fake breakdown out of the channel yet x200b remarkably the futures bear channel from that last 4 days doesn t look as impressive as spys does we did see es lose that critical 3910 pivot area but it managed to find support at 3875 next major support is 3835 and then 3805 x200b taking a look at the futures weekly chart here you can see we did finally break that weekly bull channel that dates back to cpi that really should open the downside however we obviously also wicked through the 2022 bear market resistance line too this is where it s a matter of which move is coming next this market just gives us more questions than it gives us answers now a days the once interesting thing though is that futures did bounce right off the 3870 area which is the call side of the jpm collar which expires on december 30th now the last two quarterlies we have seen us breakout over the call side of the collar and by quarterly options expiration we are sitting just above the put which is at 3425 now again history does not predict the future but that is the historical trend for the last two quarterlies this market just leaves us with more and more questions rather than answers unfortunately x200b now taking a look at tesla this is an interesting one today tesla actually despite spys pretty red open was green and more interesting than that today i noted that the overall sell pressure on spy was 23x higher than the sell pressure on tech and nyse today made me wonder if we were seeing a rotation outta spy for some reason and really this whole week i remember thursday it was the same thing that spy outta the gate led the sell off and then by mid morning afternoon tech nyse had joined in an accelerated the sell off now tesla has a ton of patterns going here on the daily we have the wider broad black falling wedge and within that falling wedge we have a red semi narrow bear channel tesla is also well below its daily 8 and daily 20ema x200b taking a look at the tesla sell buy cycles we are currently at our 11th day of the sell off and 246 drop from peak to current low that means of the average length of sell off we are nearly 2x that and we are 46 more than the average sell off cycle length drop the red bear channel and black falling wedge says monday support would be at 144 black falling wedge and 142 red bear channel if we were to see continued selling that would put tesla at day 12 of selling and 27 to 29 from peak to projected trough that would put it right at the longest length and drop of the cycle now if we believe in this being the local bottom we could be looking at about a 4 day 1404 rally that would put us by thursday at 175 x200b tesla however today hit a major support area when it touched 150 this 150 support area is exactly where the red falling wedge with its now 3rd touch and blue falling wedge also its 3rd touch both intersected each other also if we flip back to august 2020 to november 2020 the 150 area was a major resistance that took nearly 3 months for tesla to break through if there is an area that tesla is going to see a meaningful bounce off of its here weekly support 150 148 red falling wedge 145 blue falling wedge 1292 weekly resistance 1689 blue falling wedge weekly 8ema 1757 195 i am long on some 28dte 160c for tesla and i do expect tesla to minimally retest 175 by beginning to middle of next week x200b the vix is again back to being detached from reality which someone made a great point today that until cboe reconfigures how it calculates the vix with the newly introduced 0dte everyday on spy qqq and the overall increase in options being trades short term the vix is most likely going to stay detached from reality and completely useless however the biggest thing i am seeing is that we for the 3rd day in a row despite this huge spy sell off have rejected 237 breakout area until we see vix close back over that 237 and hold that area i really struggle to be bearish on spy also while i understand we had cpi and fomc during this 4 days dump on spy the vix despite a 72 drop on spy closed lower than it did 4 days ago which on most meaningful dumps on spy you should see the vix continue to close higher and higher this is another reason why i feel that we get a meaningful bounce next week because the vix is not ramping up like it did at the previous local bear market rally tops however if spy continues to drop and the vix breaks out over 237 and holds then i might actually believe that the bear market rally is over and that we could be starting our descent to 320 by spring 2023 daily log today was a tough day technical to trade for most of the day through the middle of the day we had spy looking like it wanted to rally which it ended up doing eod however we watched vold just continue to dump hard and harder every time however despite all that i was able to put in a nice green day today i actually looking back had a pretty great week x200b honestly desite how much i enjoy trading and following tesla i continue to somewhat struggle doing so granted this was a high volatile week with cpi fomc and quad witching looking at my weekly recap i had a great week of scalping again putting in a 100 win rate on strictly scalps level to level trading on spy resulted in my highest win rate since ive started tracking my l2l plays in beginning of october the profits were mild though which i mostly relate to the overall smaller daily ranges we are having which result in lower take profits previously 1015 on scalps and l2ls were easily obtained but now taking profits at 35 is about the happy spot before we see theta eat or a rogue reversal as i mentioned struggled on tesla this week so still keeping that in mind going forward on whether i just permenatly rotate it out of the lineup despite how much i enjoy it swing trade wise i took a huge loss this week mostly because i didn t close at 0dte swing on monday at open had i closed that at open i would have had a breakeven to red week when it comes to swings i did a power hour straddle this week which netted some great profits most days this week i believe netted profits for that and that s something i will continue to evaluate going forward fomc cpi lottos ended up netting me some green this week overall a great week of profits and a great week of trading despite the volatility and wildness with 3 big events in one week i am heading out of town for some family time for christmas and will not be trading monday tuesday or wednesday i really wanna disconnect from stuff and enjoy some time uniterrupted by trading with my family however depending what our plans are i may try to shoot out a pre market update and i may attempt to trade the opening hour just going to play that by ear i am swining a 7dte 384c on spy that i plan to close if we get a decent green open on monday otherwise i will just let it ride for the week i am also holding a 28dte 160c on tesla that is down 30 at open as long as i see 1605 64 by friday i will be able to close that green i will most likely unless we see signs of an extremely strong rally close both of those at 1020 profits if they present themselves if i also see things going really bad really fast i will just cut my losses and sit cash until im back trading full time on thursday enjoy your weekend guys and i will see you guys back on thursday

bears we can still have a very red week don t lose hope from on x1 day we won t be going back to normal this article is a look back on the similar 2011 debt ceiling fight in 2011 sp500 drops after debt ceiling raised notice after event 1 in the pic above when the debt ceiling was raised the market still dropped thursday s and friday s bull rally was nothing more than liquidity flowing into equities from bondstreasuries in three months from now we will look back at this point in time as the obvious top from the 2011 debt ceiling timeline wiki july 30 2011 two sources familiar with negotiations between the white house and congressional leaders say the framework of a deal is being put together the framework calls for up to $28 trillion in total deficit reduction over the next decade july 31 2011 president barack obama announced that leaders of both parties had reached an agreement to lift the debt ceiling and reduce the federal deficit separately house speaker john boehner told republicans that they had reached the framework for an agreement160 boehner revealed details of the agreement in a presentation to the house republicans161 august 1 2011 the house passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 269161 174 republicans and 95 democrats voted yes 66 republicans and 95 democrats voted no 162 august 2 2011 the senate passed the bill by a vote of 7426 28 republicans 45 democrats and 1 independent voted yes 19 republicans 6 democrats and 1 independent voted no 163 president obama signed the debt ceiling bill the same day thus ending fears of a default obama also declared that the bill is an important first step to ensuring that as a nation we live within our means 164 august 2 2011 the date estimated by the department of the treasury that the borrowing authority of the us would be exhausted if the debt ceiling crisis were not resolved45 august 3 2011 the treasury increased the national debt by $238 billion109 edited here is a better pic of sp500 timeline during and after the 2011 debt ceiling resolution
how the fed and banks are losing trust step by step with a forecasted 25 basis point rate hike let s think about why the fed started bailing out banks and even opened the floodgates but people kept taking money out of banks a dozen banks on wall street started bailing out first republic bank but last night first republic bank s stock price still fell nearly 50 ubs sold itself to ubs at a 4 valuation but ubs s acquisition was not as painful as these events what is the reason behind this one is that the fed said in 2021 that inflation was only temporary and then inflation suddenly became the biggest problem in front of people all over the world so in 2022 there was the strongest wave of interest rate hikes in history and global financial markets fell through their pants and if we want accountability it was actually the fed s error in judgment but we bore the consequences so we don t trust the fed from powell s point of view he definitely wants to raise interest rates after all the fight against inflation is his main task but now the banking crisis the biden administration and other countries in the world that have a lot of us debt the pressure of debt to powell is infinite which is the reason there is a choice to stop raising interest rates but i think tomorrow night will still raise rates as usual 25 basis points the reason is that the bank of england also did so raise rates qe will also another point is that if march does not raise rates inflation really can not hold april is no rate hike resolution can only wait until may to add so the risk is greater so this time to add 25 even if after the market panic the fed can also use other means to appease the market the big deal is to say in advance of the may rate cut chant so think about the fact that it is not so the market will be in a state of panic this is my personal opinion if you have any good comments welcome to leave a message translated with deepl

musk literally musked himself i gotta give it to the guy he s been pumpingselling vaporware to retail and institutions for decades with great success he reached and defeated the finally boss himself with probably the most overvalued deal out there 44 billion for a profitless blue bird for those who haven t i highly recommend you look at the public released texts from elon it truly is a gaze into the beholder of the guy being a nut case from his petty text fight with parag straight into that very night a 3 am bender like tangent to his boy kimball x200b kimball thought he was getting a you up text this man literally convinced himself of vaporware and then fat fingered himself into the largest lbo in history lmao all for a ttm free cash flow of 800 million and interest on 125 billion of debt culminating a negative 26 bit forward cash flow all of this for only 44 billion business extraordinaire and once you look into the financing musk has a 126 billion margin loan off balance sheet at sofr plus 3 which would cost him about 675 at current rates or 840 mil a year and we wonder why he is crying about rate hikes i see several rounds of funding within a year of going private musk will really put on a good show when he finally takes control of another cash burning business
steel partners managment is attempting to screw over shareholders steel partners splp is probably a name most around here are are not familiar with it s a diversified holding company operating in segments such as diversified materials enegry and financial services the majority of shares is held by insiders and it s thinly traded what s interesting about the company is an announcement they made on 1214 which effectivley amounts forcing small shareholders to sell specifically they announced a 1 for 12 500 reverse spilt followed immediately by a 12 500 for 1 forward split this is scheduled to take place on 182024 according to their press release of the announcement no fractional units will be issued in connection with the reverseforward unit split instead the company will pay cash without interest to any unitholder who would be entitled to receive a fractional unit as a result of the reverseforward unit split unitholders who hold fewer than 12 500 units immediately prior to the reverse unit split will be paid in cash without interest an amount equal to such number of company common units held multiplied by volumeweighted average price for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the reverseforward unit split in other words if you own fewer than 12 500 you will be forced out of the stock the publicly available float will decrease in aggregate by the total amount of shares held by shareholders owning under 12 500 shares and well good luck getting back in following the forward split as the pice will in all likelihood be higher due to the reduced share count and lack of available shares to buy since the shares are very thinly traded there s a possiblity of this stock moving higher leading up to the split shareholders just under the 12 500 mark will want to increase their holdings above the threshold to avoid being taken out and since shareholders who have no intention of rising above the level will be taken out anyway they ll likely just wait for the split to be paid out rather than selling before it aside from the interesting techinical setup this is an extremely hostile corporate action directed at small shareholders if the company wants to take them out they should offer a fair price

tesla dd ford s mache a examination of tesla s competition with $tsla implications tldr upfront upcoming ev competition is the driving dd behind the tesla bear narrative that ev competition will show up market competition will drive ev prices and therefore $tsla margins down to industrynorms i think this reasoning is flawed ford s unprofitability with the mache provides a window into what the competition is facing and why tesla is very likely to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growthinsulated from the effects of market competitionfor several years until 20262028 argument fords issues with ev profitability link ford cfo says inflation has erased mustang mache profits but isn t hurting demand cnbccom is a proxy for legacy auto s outlook writ large ford s tesla killer is their mach e which is a bev full battery crossover suv however recently ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their mach e price information is below the standard range rwd 68kwh battery 230 miles epa range the lowest $ base model is $42 895 before dealer markups and delivery fees the extended range 88kwh 300 miles epa the lowest $ long range model is $52 000 before dealerdelivery fords lack of mache profitability is very interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several costlowering factors $7 500 us federal ev subsidy ford has yet to hit the 200 000 vehicle cap for the $7500 at which point it gradually decreases tesla buyers do not qualify for any ev tax credits right now made in mexico with cheaper nonunionized labor usage of large pouchstyle batteries which are cheaper but lowerquality a more batteryefficient car formfactor as compared to a truck meaning less batteries for a desired range and therefore lower cost of production if ford is unprofitable with a highpriced ev benefiting from $7 500 made in mexico with lower priced components how are they going to be profitable with the f150 lightning the f150 lightning will be made by union labor at us labor prices have a lessefficient form factor truck aerodynamics are very bad have higher user battery needs towing range f150 lightning loses 50 of its range when towing a 23foot airstream trailer add to this coldweather battery reductions heating needs going up inclinesthe trucks 230 mile range s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly see a gradually reduced subsidy amount $7 500 $3750 $1875 it is very possible that the f150 lightning begins to see razorthin profit margins or none at all over the near future additionally ford has additional issues it has to tackle growing percentages of ev sales will reduce dealership income most of which is derived from maintenance and repair leading to more pervasive markups a need to develop a supercharging network look more deeply into their published numbersif you nix tesla s superchargers which they can access rn as tesla will jack up prices for nontesla s over time especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened and eliminate lowpower chargers look closely in your area at the actual number of high power charging stations individually there may be chargepoint nodes in your area but at least in atlanta the total stalls are very low battery supply shortages higher prices for batteries this is why fords ceo has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production so what 1 ford has to raise pricesthey have no other choice 1 none of the subbullets above dealership cut need for expanded charger network declining subsidy $ higher priced us labor higher priced batteries with lessefficient form factors is easily solvable while ford talks about separating evs from its dealership network that legal fight will take years 2 this same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 3 legacy auto debt levels looking at ford and vw in particular mean they can t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit 4 therefore legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices 5 tesla is therefore insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition add to this several teslaphenomena 1 tesla s cost of production will continue to decline meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 1 technology reasons dimecasting structural battery and 4680 if it continues to scale batteries 2 economies of scale reasons tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories 50 cagr can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone per year i would doubt these projections if it wasn t for tesla s record setting cagrwhich has surprised the entire industry over the past three years 2 therefore because tesla has more buffer to decrease pricesin an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future conclusion tesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future while some legacy auto vw might produce evs in large numbers this will not negatively impact tesla gross margins would love for folks to put forward a strong counter argument i have several $tsla 2024 leaps and if i am wrong in my assumptions here would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position
now that all the anti hollywood weirdos are out and about due to the amount of movie bombs this summer and the sag strikers causing turmoil in the industry bringing down valuations of film companies to all time lows now is the time to buy leaps and not be lecturing on how hollywood is dead and then insert ideology here is teaching hollywood a lesson disney sony paramount hell even wbd and all the other film company stocks will weather the storm just as they always have and always will
$twtr under $49 is actually a phenomenal deal some comments on the merger agmt i know there are a billion posts on here about $twtr but i don t think there s enough discussion of the actual merger agreement which to me shows that twitter is a great deal first the disclaimer this is not investment advice or legal advice i am obviously retarded and if you listen to me so are you some background much of this you probably know elon musk is buying at $5420 a share current price is below $49 and buying at $49 makes you a more than 10 return on your capital assuming the deal doesn t fall through the risk of the deal falling through is why twitter isn t trading at exactly $5420 right now in addition to the risk of having capital tied up we can see the merger agreement now it s technically a merger for reasons that don t matter but realistically elon is buying the company so pretend it s just an acquisition actually reviewing the agreement reveals the upside the closing is supposed to occur by october so capital invested should be tied up for less than six months there are seven basic ways this agreement can fall apart 1 elon and twitter both agree to go separate ways 2 elon materially breaches his obligations and twitter decides to terminate 3 twitter materially breaches its obligations and elon decides to terminate 4 twitter gets a better offer and takes it 5 some government agency holds up the deal 6 the shareholders reject the deal 7 it s just impossible to get the deal done and it s really nobody s fault but it took way too long if a party is at fault for the deal falling apart it generally speaking has to pay the other a billion dollars twitter s obligations under this agreement are very pedestrian for a $44 billion deal i ve seen single digit million dollar real estate refinancing deals that are more cumbersome so out of the ways this deal can fall apart we can basically rule out all but one twitter is not going to get a better offer and if they did that would be good not bad since we d get a better return on the investment twitter is not going to back out of the deal the board already agreed to it which was almost certainly based on discussion with big shareholders they ve also clearly decided this is best for the company and the idea that they would intentionally back out now makes no sense twitter also isn t going to screw this up their obligations under the deal are too minimal and the idea that they make the deal fall apart is very unlikely relatedly a government agency is not going to block the deal and it s not going to be impossible for this deal to be completed nothing is certain in life but those two things are about as close to certain as it gets so we re left with basically one way this deal falls apart which is that elon screws it up right now there are tons of stories out there saying oh elon already breached the deal which are making investors more skeptical that skepticism makes little sense first off elon s tweets do not breach the agreement if you read the words and think carefully about what he tweeted you ll see that the reporters who say otherwise are being sloppy and even if elon were tweeting in violation of the agreement it s not realistic to think twitter would actually back out of the deal on that basis are they going to pass on the deal of a lifetime because elon said mean things about them no so the deal can fall apart either because elon changes his mind or somehow isn t able to get financing elon clearly isn t too worried about making sure i s are dotted and t s are crossed because he s agreed to this merger agreement that is pretty easy for twitter to me this shows that he really wants to own twitter although people talk about scenarios where he uses a deal falling apart to turn a profit that makes no sense if elon backs out there is absolutely no way he makes money he can t just sell twitter for a profit right now without making sec filings which would tank the stock and even if he could based on his basis and the current trading value he would lose money when you re factoring in the $1 billion divorce fee while his financing could fall through it would require a lack of creativity on his part he has enough leveragable assets that he can find a way to buy twitter even if tesla poofed out of existence which obviously won t happen elon s spacex value alone is more than $50 billion as i said above you can see from the way the merger agreement is drafted that he wants twitter so while there are reasons to be concerned elon will mess up or back out they aren t really good reasons lastly if elon backs out he pays twitter $1 billion which is roughly 50 of twitter s cash on hand and would represent nearly 10 of their assets by book value $1 billion may not be a lot of money for elon but it actually is for twitter that s a massive cash infusion which will help the company so the downside is somewhat limited because even in a scenario where elon backs out twitter s financials suddenly look materially better so there you go it s a really good deal the potential downside is limited while the deal can fall through it s not very likely oh also did you hear that the economy unexpectedly shrunk last quarter do you have a better strategy to make 10 in six months during a recession
market recap 5323 sell the news the fed so the fed show was pretty good today i think both bulls and bears are happy to come out of that statement here are a few notes from me 1 inflationdriven as always the fed s decision will be based on inflation data which will make the market keep jittering over the upcoming cpi and economic reports inflation is still the number one priority make no mistake the fed won t stop until inflation is under control economic growth employment etc are all going to take a back seat 2 confidence in the economy maybe even optimistic about a soft landing a shallow recession is probably still their base case but i think jp personally likes what he saw in the economic data so far it s not too hot not too cold consumers are doing okay and the job market is still strong while inflation is heading towards the right direction 3 concerns over credit tightening the concern is real as he mentioned quite a few times in the statement but obviously not bad enough to pause the sloos report on may 8th should shed some light on that topic adp data beat estimates by a mile this morning but if you break it down it was quite interesting overall payroll was much higher than the estimate however manufacturing was down big time 38k wage growth also cooled down for both job stayers and job leavers which is great news for disinflation as adp s chief economist nela richardson put it the slowdown in pay growth gives the clearest signal of what s going on in the labor market right now employers are hiring aggressively while holding pay gains in check as workers come off the sidelines our data also shows fewer people are switching jobs the data pretty much confirmed what s been showing in other economic reports manufacturing contracting while service is still booming and job market tightness seems to be improving on liquidity treasury is thinking about issuing $1 trillion in bills over the next six months provided debt ceiling resolution meanwhile the fed is shrinking its balance sheet by about $95 billion per month less than $600 billion over the next six months so overall we have a net $400 billion of liquidity introduced into the system i mentioned this on monday it makes no sense i think we are at the end of qt already liquidity is only going to go up from here and nonstop qe will continue in perpetuity the economy crude oil was down another 5 today over the weekend i wrote about quite a few downbeat economic reports from china and europe i think they have destroyed oil bulls with concerns about the outlook for global demand wti as well as commodity index as a whole is quickly approaching march lows and has already given up all gains since 2022 it s good news for disinflation but it makes one wonder if we are heading towards a global recession even after adjusting for seasonality effects and differing numbers of working days in a given month global trade volumes dropped further in march to the lowest levels since 2020 on an adjusted basis and well below trend interesting charts from barclays on how vix lags cds in response to the debt ceiling crisis in 2011 and how wide the gap is today i think vix may have reached a bottom as the fed left more doubt than answers today with earnings season coming to an end and the fed pause not happening the market needs to face a lot of uncertainties this month like the debt ceiling regional banks more economic and inflation data etc and a lot has not been priced into the stock market yet more data on the consumers boa q1 data confirmed household savings are still high and spendings are solid midincome groups spend heavily dining out the business corporate debts still appear healthy last month the only bond discount margin only that was downgraded was from banks with upgrades for the rest ford had a double beat but the stock went down due to lower guidance their ev business is terrible not only is volume down 33 yoy but ebit margin is at 102 it s dead in the water imo tsla has no competition in the ev market at least not for a long time qualcomm went lower after lowering its guidance they reported a 17 yoy decline in handset chip sales citing slow smartphone sales in china it s worth noting that 20 of qcom s revenue is from apple with samsung s miserable earnings report before this i have a bad feeling about aapl tomorrow on a positive note food companies are continuing to perform well as consumers still have plenty of cash to spend these companies have strong pricing power and can still enjoy expanding margins even with inflation raging on kraft heinz beat both the top and bottom line with earnings up 133 driven by higher prices x200b my positions have not changed spy 615 400 put iwm 615 165 put tlt jan 2024 110115 leap call spreads

bbby options listen carefully and speculate with me 1 kirkland and ellis ke was brought in to get chapter 11 ready 2 ke helping with loan renegotiation andor new loans with more favorable terms 3 sell the company or portions of it there could be other options such as equity raise but these are the most plausible if you are bbby execs now that your activist is out you would not want your equity to be wiped out as your 1 option the fact that it is not going to $5 or lower says that no one really knows watch this closely options is the best play if good news this thing will take off faster than a falcon rocket if bankruptcy you can still trade the swing

twitter opinions long call will print here s my take on twitter twitter was one of the few red stocks on friday after our lord and savior musk waved his hands to manipulate the twitter stock it seems to have corrected to original stock price before he got his hands on it to about $4000 x200b so i was thinking of 3 possible outcomes which one is most likely x200b 1 elon is forced to buy the company at 5400 2 elon buys at a discount maybe $45 as a compromise 3 elon backs away from the deal on contract fine print and takes his 9 billion with him i think that he is likely to buy it the reason is he wants it he likes twitter he wants it on a human level and he wants to own it he doesn t want to hurt tesla though so i think option 2 is the right play x200b i think if you buy 4555 dollar calls for 2024 they will print money but 33 chance to go the other way x200b better than a casino x200b positions raytheon lockheed martin twitter

shop thoughts discussion what do you guys think of shopify its down by like 80 and corners over 30 of the canadian ecommerce market i think that it can last for over 5 years even though it has a high pe ratio but it is a new company so that can also mean that it has a lot of growth left if it can get an even bigger share of the canadian market and gain a foot into the american market which it will because us americans always create new businesses i can honestly see its market cap rising from 34bil to at least 150bil in the next 57 years thoughts

seasonal pattern voodoo for the last several cycles we have been tracking fairly accurately and i m making the assumption that will not change because trend is your friend bad news for bears last week of october is usually extremely bullish to add further insult to injury for those who opened puts at close on friday from a seasonally charting perspective the previous week was the last significant drawdown before year end you can take it from any perspective that you like we have all years preelection years logarithmic etc however you get the same result when you reflect that on our current market conditions on the 4year presidential election cycle 19492022 vs 2023 chart and the nasdaq one in both instances you can see a low in the early q4 cycle followed by a rather muted middle q4 ultimately in the final ending of q4 and explosive rally that dials into a new high for the year the 200dma being broken on a single candle is not yet significant typically traders want to see an acceptance short of a catastrophic systemic change or event covid huge change in monetary policy the 200 will be hard to break with new lows consecutively on a weekly basis

dear sec i ve seen a bunch of funny memes and posts the in past day about the sec s decision to create a special meme category for certain stocks such as gme and amcfor consumer protection i saw that mr burns looking moron give an interview lying through his crooked yellow rotten teeth about how this is meant to protect the consumer against risky investments so if an investment is risky it constitutes it as a meme if so is 90 of tech a meme netflix is down from 700 to 200 is that a meme how about paypal being down from 300 to 80 both a part of a long line of profitable and sustainable tech companies that have possibly cost some investors a much larger absolute amountpercentage than what the sec calls a meme my idiot cousin who works as a broker said it s easy to know what a meme isjust look at wsb and whatever has a bunch of memes about it is a meme so if we post memes about apple microsoft amazon and other blue chips do they become memes will the sec put them in that category too this isn t just idiotic it s corrupt and very dangerous the government body meant to ensure the legal trade of securities in this country is actively picking and choosing which stocks to put in a shitbasket called memes this is literally a government agency telling people which stocks not to buybased on zero rationale the only meme here is that these morons take home a nice salary get health insurance and a pension off of our tax dollars

robinhood risky gamble or lucrative venture good morning good afternoon good evening and goodnight fellow regarded investors x200b tldr short term bullish on hood from growth caused by ftx collapse and reliable revenue generation from margin and paymentfororderflow in a bear market longer term bearish as sbf s hood shares may be used to cover court expenses and compensation to ftx stakeholders x200b dd this post is dd as of 242023 this post contains my biased opinions as well as factual information i will cite any factual information this post is biased because i am currently in a bullish position for robinhood $hood robinhood brief overview history robinhood is the first broker to bring free trading to retail investors investopedia 1 being the first broker to bring free trading to retail investors is no small feat this is one of a few reasons that robinhood has brought 229 million accounts to their platform as of q3 2022 q3 hood pg 6 as the market snp500 rose from q4 2020q3 2021 robinhood experienced a related growth in monthly active users from 117 million to a peak of 213 million q3 hood pg7 during this time of growth the initial meme stock madness of gamestop gme took place where robinhood removed the opportunity for investors to purchase gme shares cnbc many investors were outraged at robinhood as they could no longer buy gme despite outrage robinhood had another quarter of user growth as this event unfolded in q1 2022 q3 hood pg 7 not only did hood have growth during the quarter involving the outrage over gme but the growth extended into the following quarter q2 2021 as well q3 hood pg7 operations robinhood markets inc operates financial services platform in the united states its platform allows users to invest in stocks exchangetraded funds etfs options gold and cryptocurrencies the company also offers various learning and education solutions comprise snacks a digest of business news stories learn which is a collection of approximately articles

who have yet to place a trade robinhood markets inc was incorporated in 2013 and is headquartered in menlo park california yahoo finance profile ok so what do they actually do payment for order flow margin stock lending cash sweep q3 financials pg 17 a broker kinda importantly i believe that payment for order flow and margin are the most important components to robinhood s operations robinhood allows investors to use margin on their accounts from robinhood s website as of 242023 robinhood financial charges a standard margin interest rate of 1125 and a margin interest rate of 725 for customers who subscribe to gold the margin interest rate is calculated by adding 65 for nongold customers or 25 for gold customers to the upper bound of the target federal funds rate which is set by the federal reserve and is subject to change without notice hood margin what s important here is that robinhood is giving non gold members margin at a steep price while incentivizing users to move to gold $5month for more favorable terms users with gold are guaranteed $5 revenue per month regardless of margin utilization or orders placed the play current thesis i am currently in and will increase my shortterm bullish position i expect a drop in the stock price in the long term so i have a long term bearish position as well bullish november 11 2022 ftx collapse investopedia 2 vlad tenev hood ceo tweets the following during the ftx collapse in this flight to safety we re proud that customers are turning to robinhood vlad twitter this migration which took place in q4 2022 was likely not forecasted by analysts or robinhood themselves this shift in crypto may cause investors who have moved away from robinhood to return and possibly bring their other assets with them my speculation is that more investors came back to or started with robinhood increasing assets and increasing revenues the market snp 500 was down over 2022 this may have caused retail investors to be locked into their losing positions if an investor were to have purchased the security on margin they were forced to hold or sell at a loss selling the losing position and likely entering into a new position generates payment for order flow revenue for hood holding the position and waiting for the market to turn around generates revenue on the margin lent to the investor as of q3 2022 margin revenue was up 31 yy q3 financials pg 17 ultimately no matter what investors did during 2022 hood profited bearish sam bankmanfried sbf former owner and ceo of ftx owned a few shares of robinhood 56 million shares coindesk sbf based on the shares outstanding 83568 million yahoo finance statistics sbf held about 67 of the outstanding shares sbf will need to pay for court expenses and it s likely the assets could be used

this is a small dumb little thing but it s huge in its implications google puts chrome on windows arm effectively seeding chromebooks the browser wars are back hi i am the arm guy with a position in arm google msft and 1 share of apple to see what it does it looks here that google has reversed course to play nice with windows arm the reasons for this are related to ai because if users have to use native edge to get any useful ai experience when the onslaught of windows on arm devices start to roll out chrome would have been at a severe disadvantage in a way chrome had to do this the implications are huge here google in effect is saying our ad business is more important than our chromebook business microsoft will be able to roll out more cheaper and battery efficient windows devices as a result effectively taking chromebook notion off of the table that last part is just how i see it but it makes sense even more than that ai will be so integral to the os that the only way google can hope to fight back is with chrome so that is probably another additive reason of why this makes sense interesting tidbit of information as the 2000 s are back baby

let s review jim cramer s 2000 stock picks cramer has been wrong more often than right lets review what he said in 2000 in february 2000 hedgefund manager james j cramer proclaimed that internetrelated companies are the only ones worth owning right now these winners of the new world as he called them are the only ones that are going higher consistently in good days and bad cramer even took a potshot at graham you have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that existed before the web if we used any of what graham and dodd teach us we wouldn t have a dime under management the intelligent investor rev ed the definitive book on value investing by benjamin graham 2020 picks
buying otm spy puts is probably a solid move right now deep otm puts on spy that are cheap and worth losing if they agree on raising the ceiling now like everyone else i m 99 certain the debt ceiling will get raised and everything will continue on as it is however if that 1 chance happens to come true and you own deep otm spy puts those will be worth a ton more than what you put into it if what professionals are saying is true i would expect to see the market drop to some insane level in which markets would get haltedso you run the risk of dealing with that too either way i don t see what s wrong with spending money you know you can burn on deep otm spy puts just in case the debt ceiling isn t raised the idea that this is some kind of outrageous preposterous idea to suggest frankly unwarranted this is what options were meant for and bitching against the idea of doing this goes against what the tool was meant to do source edit if you think otherwise and would like to share why by all means share it i ll even remove the post if you can logically explain to me why this is some kind of terrible idea to do the insane amount of aggression towards this post is really shocking to see and i don t understand where these comments are coming from when this is what options were designed to do

$rddt reddit s ipo what we know so far with crayons i have included a coloring book with crayons for those of you who can t read but still want to be kept in the loop for the rest of you some may already know about this information others may not and others may not even know what reddit is that is okay we will work through this together crayon users need not read any further just use the included coloring book the crayons are nontoxic x200b 1 what is reddit reddit is a social media platform for antisocial people users can create their own communities or subreddits on any topic they choose subreddits can be about anything from news and politics to hobbies and interests autism depression gambling crayons or hentai x200b 2 intro to reddit s ipo $rddt in december 2021 reddit issued a stealth ipo filing with the sec at a valuation of $15 billion back when the stock market was making millionaires due to some issues related to the tech crash and other nonsense at the time reddit pulled back on their ipo plans for a while but they have since been reinvigorated while there are no definitive facts the consensus that means most in the know intelligent people not wsb is that reddit now plans to ipo in 2h 2023 at a valuation of $10 billion a third less than their original plans in 2021 this $10b price tag is largely based on their estimated 2022 valuation so it could be slightly higher which we ll get into later i m expecting to hear or read if i ever learn how to a lot of stuff surrounding ai advertising and paid subscription tiers among other things that support this $10b ipo valuation as some of you may know reddit has been gradually developing and deploying its own form of ai but as we all know from uvisualmod and uautomoderator it s more like ar artificial retardation especially when compared to chatgpt and bard we have the dollar tree of ai reddit s ipo is expected to be a huge event for the tech industry i believe their ipo will be around $135 billion now that reddit has ai as part of their nomenclature and a better established quickly growing subscription base x200b 3 important stuff reddit has become increasingly popular in recent years and now has over 55 million daily active users the company s growth has been driven by its absurd focus on user engagement and its ability to connect people with others who share their interests making sure to keep them inside of their parent s basements not interacting with the real world crayon stock continues to decline but online tech continues to increase what does this mean for reddit s ipo reddit is going to be valued at a huge premium considering the current state of today s social media ecosystem reddit provides something none of these other platforms truly bring to the table a true sense of community engegement for its users at one point twitter did this in a similar way but as we all know mr tesla has different more worldconqueringesque plans for that platform reddit is likely to face some hard dick competition from other social media platforms such as facebook and twitter these platforms have a much larger base than reddit and they are also more established but as people continue to get tired of zucc and tusk it would not be surprising to see reddit begin to implement more traditional social media platform characteristics to compete with these players and suck the basement dwellers and makeup artists from them i also see reddit adding more live video tiktok type implementations 35 fundamentals 1 2022 revenue estimates $420510 million 2 main source of revenue advertising reddit premium subscription 3 2022 yy growth rate estimate 3537 4 2022 estimated valuation $10 billion 5 2023 reddit premium users estimate 651 000 this represents nearly a 37 increase vs 2022 estimates of 473 000 6 google search queries that bring up reddit results has continued to grow steadily over the last 5 years as reddit continues to build a repository of highquality user knowledge in everything from 3d printing to making espresso how to have sex and how to lose money in the stock market among other things 7 statistically reddit also has the most loyal user base with reddit users more likely to not use any other form of social media this is in stark contrast to other platforms that more often have users who actively user multiple platforms what does this mean it means advertisers know the only way they will reach certain demographics is through targeted advertising on reddit x200b 4 how you can make money reddit s ipo could be a major opportunity for rwsb investors rwallstreetbet traders stand to benefit financially better than any other if the team works together on this we are the 25th largest entity on reddit and if some of our resident whales decide to pick up enough shares we might transcend our heritage of regardedness and break this cycle of loss porn creating a oncethoughtimpossible kind of porn gain porn however apes should also be aware of some of the risks associated with reddit s ipo the company faces some stiff dick competition from other social media platforms there is some uncertainty about how reddit will perform in the future but like all companies that provide valuable services especially in the tech industry it could turn into something huge x200b this isn t financial advice etc x200b sources google stuff x200b x200b

amc terrible quarter i just finished reviewing the amc quarter i am surprised that they still couldn t turn a profit from either a ebitda or cf perspective given the return to theatres and pandemic normalization revenue growth surprised me but cost containment was disappointing especially film gross margin admissions film costs of only 50 58 58 53 and 57 in prior 4 quarters which is the lowest it has been in a while i guess this is what peak volume margins look like since hollywood extracts tougher deals in postpandemic times than during the pandemic the biggest problem is the balance sheet fcf was 117m this means the business itself lost $117m in this supposed recovery quarter i see the revenue recovery but not the earnings for the first half of 2022 the company has lost $450m running this business they need to turn it around quickly i m not sure how they do that given the pandemic recovery should have helped them the net cash position is the worst it has been in 4 quarters 4390b prior 4 3661b 3813b 3808b 4333b i have always hoped the apes make a lot of money as i have no axe to grind as an impartial referee this isn t going to cut it profits are necessary all the shenanigans with stock dividends mining investments etc are all a distraction the core theatre business has to make money this was supposed to be the quarter didn t happen when will it disclosure short a small amount of amc in my trading competition with matt kohrs x200b edit i should note they did have positive ebitda but it was quite low at $80m 1h22 only $13m a run rate of $320m and a multiple of 20x ebitda very generous the business would be worth 64b which when paying off the debt would result in only 20b of equity value or $4 per share the business has to improve

just eat takeaway group a delivery food service dying slowly just eat takeawaycom nv formerly takeawaycom founded as thuisbezorgdnl it is a dutch multinational online food ordering and delivery company formed from the merger of londonbased just eat and amsterdambased takeawaycom in 2020 this is the mother entity this is the value of the share price of the firm currently it is priced as 35 billion that is a lot of money that is 35 times 1000 million the average salary of a someone in europe is the following when this firm announced their ipo that mentioned the following they consider them leading forefront runners in that same prospectus it mentions their successful ratio of being front leaders only losses from 2013 to 2016 their ebitda in their ipo prospectus it was no different only losses you can read here that in the prospectus the firm mentions they carry the risk of floating interest rate risk if we look at the current they are constantly in debt and have to restructure their debt continuously not only do they not make money the entry into such a market is very small they are just a servicing company they don t produce anything like any of the other xxth firms on the market they provide food as a nice to have function from restaurant a to client b they magically keep losing money yet have a valuable share price i know this firm has debt maturities outstanding the largest outstanding at 125 has been growing massively last year but not only that we all know restaurants are extremely difficult to run cost expensive and difficult to keep alive lately in the news there have been many issues about how justeat threatens their customers and many of the firms that are signed up to justeat have threatened to leave because justeat already takes a large margin of their profit but only want more while the bottom end the workers of justeat etc are striking for poor salaries because it s simple economics more competitors margins go down i despise the practices of this dead firm where executives profit no one else i see this as a firm which 1 has many competitors and this is growing which means the margin will decline in the future 2 has never been profitable so this firm existence day on day simply bleeds every day 3 at some point if interest rates are high enough you can t keep running a business where your net profit margin is negative 4 if your supply pool wants to leave you news article you will only lose more 5 there are more articles who find justeat an absolute knife on throat business and stress restaurant owners which is already a very stressful job many restaurants don t survive it s difficult 6 yet the firm is valued at 35bn has a share price of over 10 euro s so if you ask me is the financial market making sense no is this firm dead yes why is it kept alive debt is a lovely tool i have frequently shorted justeat on heavy derivatives from time to time and will do so until this despicable company i ve walked into restaurants where they utterly complained about barely surviving in this economy and justeat isn t making it easier i ve got a friend who runs a restaurant but not takeaway and this hits me on every angle for every justeat i can grab another company in any other domain which technically is dead yet their directors are earnings excess money the average joe barely earns anything at all this isn t a cherrypicked example in the uk you have deliveroo uber does ubereat or something but i can also pick completely other firms which are dead yet have market value of billions billions of hot airs i trade just eat constantly i have an utter hatred for this firm but have done my due dilligence i trade them constantly in a simple dumb algorithm which i used to build when i was a banker as i started my career in banking a long time ago as a banker the stock market is not a reflection of the economy or the participants in this economy that suffers and i have no feeling at all that this ever will end well i have met so many suffering stories from restaurant owners who suffer under the reigns of this firm that i am seriously considering legal action to me this is a dead firm and will die slowly but surely they have various daughter entities they might sell for liquidity that will be a spike so my advice is go for a vol box when you hear the news this firm shows that is has value but there is no accounting nor mathematical evidence that this is the case feel free to plunder and booty

tesla discussion hello everyone i wanted to bring up something that a lot of people don t really discuss about companies people talk about price technicals pe ratios gross margins etc but those things only impact the quarterly results and short term price movement but what is a big driver of the long term trajectory of a company vision culture the reason i m bullish about tesla in the long term is because i like their energy autonomy vision and they have a culture to disrupt tesla is full of brilliant people who work extremely hard now ofc hardwork does not always yield results you have to be working on the right things and working smart thats why i said you also need vision over long periods of time vision culture disruption over the short term i have no idea what tesla will do but in the long term i believe tesla has all the ingredients to be making some of the most disruptive productsservices in society in the next 510 years and therefore will be the largest company in the world

in the long term we are all dead in the short and intermediate term we are all screwed the cpi sure hit it out of the park today exceeding every expectation and destroying the notion that inflation has peaked already shortly afterwards the consumer sentiment number came in at a record low of 502 down 14 from may the fed meets next week and apparently 75 basis points may be on the table it should oh and the first big chunk of assets from the fed s balance sheet is going to roll off on the 15th resulting in godknowswhat reaction in the bond markets the economic turmoil is just getting started and there doesn t appear to be any signs of things changing looking over the cpi report the numbers are way worse than even the headline number suggests may came in at 1 mom signaling that double digit inflation may be in our future the food category was up 12 for the month and many segments are showing mid teens increases yoy a third of the overall weighting of the cpi is shelter which is ridiculously underreported at 55 average rents have gone up 15 and home prices 20 in the last year what would this number look like if properly calculated consumer sentiment has always been more of a soft economic number given that it is based on feel rather than hard numbers but a decline that puts the figure below both 2008 and 1999 is nevertheless startling when you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real layoffs hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion people are pessimistic about housing purchases gas prices and energy costs to name a few the thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers if people feel that everything is more expensive they may feel poorer and spend less as a result even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems it can become a self fulfilling prophecy and then there are the financial markets despite the recent beatings that most financial instruments have taken since the end of last year qqq and spy are still about 20 higher than prepandemic levels keep in mind that we are currently in a highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle with the fed beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet unlike prepandemic there still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall the reason that these issues aren t going to go away anytime soon is due to my new favorite term excessive savings this term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range it s funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem on the one hand it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power on the other hand this excess cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back that may take awhile to add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down how much leverage is there actually being employed in our financial markets we all got a deserved laugh at bill hwang blowing up billions using ridiculous leverage in his opaque family office dealings his mentors at tiger global management are down 50 making one wonder what type of risk they have on their books elon leveraged his tsla shares to buy twitter michael saylor from mstr leveraged a balance sheet full of fake internet money to get loans to buy more fake internet money the big guys are doing these types of things but what about the small fish there was a hilarious post the other night about someone who sold their house and instead of paying cash for the next property they put a big chunk in stocks and took a margin loan against their portfolio to pay for the place after 5 weeks of declines they were facing a $250k margin call that they couldn t meet who knows if this is even true but we see actual examples of this stuff in the daily financial news pretty frequently with the big fish how many little fish are leveraged to the hilt long story short we are facing historically high inflation rising interest rates quantitative tightening plummeting consumer sentiment falling markets and potential issues that haven t even come to light yet what could go wrong positions cash gang waiting for a decent entry qqq 250 spy 350 at a minimum tldr the economy is screwed

inflation mystery to me wouldn t inflation make stock prices go up is everything more expensive except stocks the $ is worth less so now stocks are worth double less wtf is happening is the economy so bad that it is even worse than inflation but why are companies still hiring so much still is it that inflation hurts companies so they are worth less than the rate of inflation is the same true for companies for which inflation would not have a big impact like tech companies they don t have to buy a bunch of stuff to run the company employee wages and facility cost are their only real cost but tech is down the most and it would be the least impacted by inflation a company that makes stuff would be more impacted because their raw goods just jumped in price and why is it that all the companies fall and rise together is our economy really that interconnected

geo group valuation dear sirsmadams i m writing to you today about a stock i own called geo group as a wise man once said the stock speaks for itself nevertheless here are the facts michael the world is ending burry bought it its got a short interest of 16 its profitable and positive cash flow 2022 profit and cash flow is on track to grow vs 2021 and 2020 its undervalued due to a biden bill outlawing private prisons and it ceased being a reit to stop paying dividends to service debt but a loophole in the bill allows geo to convert its prisons into immigration detention centers to remain profitmaking its debt was also recently restructured such that there are no major repayments until 2024 but what that really means is beyond me based on my shitty analysis humbly attached heretofore if we dcf their 3 year historical free cashflows to infinity assuming 0 growth and 12 wack we arrive at a fair value of $1289 per share what s it trading at now therein lies suspense in conclusion
confusion over preferred equity help me understand if i buy 100 shares in a public traded company i have an equity position in the company albeit a very very small one if that company spins off part of the company to form a new publicly traded company i would normally now own stock in both of those companies at some ratio determined by the companies each then trades independently and the value of the shares is based on the perceived value of the company based on fundamentals and mystery if the company i own 100 shares in instead provides me with 100 shares of a preferred equity what company does my second 100 shares hold equity in the original company where therefore means that i now essentially have 200 shares in that same company since everyone who held shares now has the same thing happen my ownership stays the same the fundamental valuation of the company has not changed so what have i gained logically to me this means that the stock price of the original 100 shares drops equal to the amount of the price of the second 100 shares initially going forward they could trade independently but not sure why since both have the same level of equity in the company if the company fails does my preferred equity put me higher on the creditors list

what do you think about bombardier new global 8000 the bbd has added a new business jet to it s already impressive catalogue the new 8000 which is set to be in server for 2025 will be capable fly at march 094 and travel at 8000 nautical distance this makes it the fastest and the longest range plane in the business jet industry recent the company has reverse split stock 301 i myself am a fan of the canadian company for it s innovation business model and they restructuring the company bbd was even able to upgrade back to the txs now imagine that you can get to your destination in less time then it would usually take you you are saving hours for casual or business travel purposes and not stopping during flight time also the cabins are already immense which are made for a comfortable smooth flight please go to the and see the technology implemented for sustainability energy efficiency and reliability the price tag is $ 78 000 00000 which is kind of expensive but if you got the guap this shouldn t be an issue for the value that the jet provides it is probably worth it i currently invested for the longterm and i would really like to see the price of the stock reach $80 and the market move over $20b although i do think that c19 gave an advantage to the bombardier while commercial flight was restricted i hope that they will still be preform extremely well and that the russianukrainian war does not affect to badly so what do you think
your guide to q2 usa stock market april here we come before we begin i would like that we all have a onemin of silence for the chicken genius aka keng tang and his contribution to wall street who worked day and night to help retail investors get an edge over the big institutions and hedge funds in the financial world x200b chicken genius july 2019 march 2022 we all will surely miss him it doesn t matter if he chickened out and sold everything in the market crash what matters is he recovers from whatever emotions he might be going through now that the market has recovered he should not have deserved this amount of hate from both retail and other financial youtubers at the end of the day it s you people making your own financial decision so it s your fault if you lose money while following someone s advice just go follow someone who is correct 100 of the time oh wait there isn t one we people just sometimes take things too far and over abuse the power of social media cancel culture what we don t take into account is the fact that the other person is also a human being who might be going through some stuff that we dont know of hurting someone when the guy is down guys we are better than this lets make sure we don t lose any other financial youtubers in short all i wanna say is if you cant say something good just don t say it and if you can then go say it it might make someone s day good x200b ps god if someone said in the comments section that he shouldn t read it i will flose it x200b x200b x200b respected traders investors x200b first of all i would like to apologize that i didn t do my hw on the top 10 pts we were going to discuss i guess that makes me the laziest guy on wall street this post i wrote was intended to be sent yesterday right before april 1 so that you wont take this as a joke but ig sh9tpost like this are meant to be taken as a joke lol x200b regardles i hope you are all enjoying and loving this euphoric rally in the stock market you cash hodlers you just couldn t stop yourself from investing after march 15 in apple and tesla as a place to hedge yourself against inflation could you i admire your level of confidence in the stock market you guys are absolutely killing it for now x200b tesla up 4437 from my call apple up 1837 from my call x200b but now the question in everyone s mind remains is this a bear market rally or are we finally out of the woods now x200b as my readers already know my stand that from march 16 fomc aftermath we predicted this exit liq rally which i said would last till q2q3 imo and q4 22 2023 recession note right now i see the daily stochastic of high growth and value stocks maxed out so a slight selloff of about 510 in april s first week is coming explanation is ahead x200b now that i have repeated my recession in q4 2022 line a million times and made it clear come lets have a look at markets and understand some theories and news you need to keep in the back of your mind to help prepare yourself better for going into q2 x200b x200b 1 historical returns x200b april is the strongest month april has by far been the strongest month in the history of the stock market even during the bear market x200b weakness at the start and end of month sell in may and go away so here s what i think could happen a slight selloff during the first week prior to the cpi release and then after the release we go up till the end of the month and then you sell and prepare yourselves a nice holiday vacation in the bahamas yes i am serious you have to enjoy your time too and refreshen your mind coz that is what the big institutions and hfs around the globe do x200b note if april becomes a disastrous month it will be your warning signal that something worse is about to hit every stock market around the globe x200b x200b x200b 2 relationship bw ff rates spx flattening curve 2s and 10s treasury yields diff all the curves have been inverted except 10y and 3months chart us10yus02y blue line fed funds rate orange line spx i know guys it s complicated with nothing written over it lemme explain and try to make it understandable x200b from yr 19852022 whenever the federal reserve decides to raise interest rates to combat inflation they end up inverting the curve during the tightening cycle after 2 or 3 rate hikes the gray vertical lines not the dotted lines are the period whenever the curve has been inverted the only exception was 1995 when it didn t cause the recession after gradual rate hikes but it also didn t cause these exceptionally dangerous logdown lines the wall street and suits don t tell you this only i do so if the current graph in log causes these monstrous looking lines with u sign it would mean you re in a bubble and it s about to burst in 6 to 24 months also this time we are having an inverted curve only after the 1st quarter basis pt which suggests something dangerous is going on behind the scenes that s your job to figure out i know it s mine too but i haven t reached that conclusion yet is it something related to dedollarization or the soverign debt crisis about to happen because of money printing by every country in the world x200b note 1st u crash of 1987 reason vix and skew options 2nd u dotcom bubble of 2000 reason crazy tech valuations 3rd u housing crisis of 2008 reason subprime mortgages 4th u covid crash reason man ate a bat x200b x200b 3 oil prices x200b oil technicals x200b if you have ever thought that federal reserve manipulates bonds or some hfs and institutions control the price of stocks well the oil price currently is like next level open manipulation seriously russia is holding their oil reserves and putting pressure on the eu to buy oil in rubles they are kinda taking supply out of the market hence increasing oil price that in turn is causing the usa stock market to have a fall so putin put whereas the usa on the other hand is releasing supply by the help of opac oil barrels today they are going to release a record no of supply lets see how bad the oil prices drop there is a technical level which can crash oil prices lets see if biden manages to do it and hence in turn would lead to the stock market to rally if it indeed happens so biden buy x200b x200b 4 important events x200b a jobs cpi april far worse may less worse june idk job reports and cpi releases imo are seeing a lot of volatility in recent days these events generally have a sharp pump starting just before the release of the report and then after 5mins when the report is out they dump and come back to those same levels that were yesterday crazy right x200b x200b j powell x200b x200b b fomc minutes minutes as you all remember was what caused the january crisis the writing on that was far worse imo we wont see another worse minute like that coz fed has got only the two tools interest rates and balance sheet they pretty much used them in minutes the secret volcker weapon is to be used in fomc not minutes x200b talking about fomc federal reserve meeting as you all know depends on a single man called jerome powell current status hawkish and whether he chose to come out as this puppet of biden or not x200b here s what we know so far i will try to keep this as dumbed down as possible x200b inflation is high across the world why due to qe being injected by every other central bank of the world and saving people from going into recession during the pandemic the result of money printing devalues currency which in turn increases the price of assets you own including stocks and other assets this in turn creates a wealthy environment which most likely leads to people spending more money on things when the lockdown gets over also the lowcost borrowing environment helps businesses stay afloat and hence we also see a massive boom in ipos and spacs companies make tremendous profits in these conditions inflation is also caused due to the global supply chain issues covid sometimes it acts deflationary as was the case in delta but not omicron as stated above and now the war print money for military spending and help countries causing oil commodity and metals price shock now remember the fed and other central banks of the world can control demand side inflation and not the supply side in a normal economy where inflation is under the 4 fed target fed can t raise rate too aggressively in war times due to demand destruction caused by oil and commodity shocks but in last meeting fed said they had to start raising rates and they don t care about supplyside inflation going away eventually hence the word transitory is not being used anymore two scenarios case 1 fed is right inflation will go down due to war which in turn will happen when russia backs off which in turn will happen if putin doesn t remain in power or he signs a peace treaty ans then fed is doing things right by raising quarter basis pts you don t need paul volcker x200b case 2 the fed isn t right nothing happens to putin and supply chain persists longer due to china noncovid policy then inflation will continue to persist longer and higher and raising quarter basis pts won t do jack shit and hence stocks and other assets will continue to go up as bonds sell off and real estate goes down with every quarter basis pts hike coz the money has to go somewhere tina they call it so now fed has to control demand side inflation coz the supply side arent going away people want to protect themselves from inflation and they think buying value stocks with pricing power is the way to go that s what s happening right now x200b you got another two scenarios x200b case 1 you need a volcker now this is about to happen now that fed leaked the msg bw uk and usa central bank they are preparing for recession if you volcker us then demand will go to 0 and kill the economy but will inflation from russia s shock go away no high inflation with high unemployment will remain stagflation is what we get now worse of its kind coz fed two goals didn t get accomplished bonds get destroyed due to yield shocks and so will other assets too and then later global shock eases and no more hiking now you might see bond gold rally because now we are in a great depression where a slow down in economic activity will last longer remember gold is being manipulated by jpmorgan and the government because they don t want people to invest in it case 1 you don t do a volcker kick the can down the road just like previous cycles when they just ignored the eyes on the housing bubble and let it prop so much that it burst on its own and then you bail out by injecting qe this time too they could inject qe but after a recession and then devalue your currency more and send stocks and other assets to freakin mars coz you already visited the moon in 2021 or you could just hyperinflate now and pay all of their debt lose global reserve currency status and follow japanese policy but you need balls for that xd x200b 4 four sigma bubble collapse chart x200b xlkspx and color orange 10yr bonds yield yes guys there is a chart for the sigma bubble collapse what this chart suggests is that as the 10y bond yields went down from 20002020 the nasdaq index outperformed the sp500 eventually throughout the time right now we are at the kind of special region where breaking the white line will trigger a black swan in bonds now i honestly dont know what will happen to stocks but if yields keep getting destroyed by the rise in interest rates then eventually a time in the stock market will come when it will be overloaded by the bond holders who are running away and going for tina in stock market if the bond becomes lucrative enough say like 510 investors will rush for it quickly and hence thereby causing the dotcom style collapse hence you hear suits and institutions come on and tv and say things like yah fed isnt gonna raise rates more than 4 times this year but if you believe that bonds are gonna reject from the white line then why the hell are you in the stock market kindly exit the doors right now and buy 10yr and 2yr bonds at 23 one for trading and other for investing x200b note white line hasn t been broken till date that could also mean everything collapse hence i wrote above breaking the white line will trigger something that i honestly dont know so bond yields up and stock prices down so housing down and the other unnamed asset too is a possibility too x200b x200b 5 corporate greed chart x200b no one likes to see this chart i got a comment from two posts earlier that there is no such thing as corporate greed i would like to say look at this chart nowadays you are hearing things like billionaire taxes on unrealized gains and corporate taxes to rise from 21 to 28 in america this all means government thinks yes corporate greed is a thing although i dont like the billionaire tax it s stupid to tax things that aren t realized corporate greed the company now has to pay extra taxes their profits margin will take a hit and the only way to recover from it will be to lay off some people hence unemployment should go up in theory but it doesn t always mean recession x200b x200b 6 vix skew and dxy x200b dxy it still looks strong and would break $100 if the fed continues this tightening cycle skew a lot of put options are still in the market which suggests the fact that some people still believe we are in a bear market vix the vix is still elevated above 18 which suggests fear is still present in the market with a lot of volatility x200b x200b conclusion i humbly oblige you people to sell everything before april end do not wait for q3 exit liq rally you exit in q2 and wait for another 10 to 20 correction reason would be balance sheet tantrums like the 2018 may fomc which the market hasn t thrown out yet it still believes the fed doesn t have the vote for that last time the fed tried this method the overnight repo rate shot up 10 fed knows they are in a tough spot you can all see and hear powell s voice x200b pink spx orange federal reserve sheet x200b thank you guys for reading this i know it wasn t that interesting and quite a lot of boring content in it which we have discussed already before sorry again guys next time i will surely give you your soveirgn debt crisis in case some new viewers are wondering what i preach it is to hodl cash for 50 drop from ath or to buy gold silver and chinese hong kong index and stocks x200b lots of love hope you all have a great spring and you guys take that vacation sell in may april last week and go away is what wall street says x200b regards dante my eyes see everything

can someone who s not an idiot explain this to me the current inflationary environment is a product of an economy that has much more demand than it can supply demand for skilled labor demand for chips and demand for all the products down the line from that labor and those chips prices are rising because there s not enough to go around and everyone has to pay top dollar for goods and services creating this feedback loop as a result jpow and co are reducing that demand with rate hikes it hasn t even really started yet as the american consumer is still as healthy as ever and the job market still chugging away it should be pretty apparent that the supply needs to increase if this inflation is going to get under control so the us is starting a massive investment period to build the infrastructure to manufacture chips domestically while the fed is trying to start a recession how is the economy supposed to recover from supply line disasters abroad by kickstarting domestic manufacturing if the fed is concurrently trying to choke the demand for that economy it seems like the left hand doesn t know what the right hand is doing kind of like my wife s boyfriend etc and other misc wendy s related dumpster jokes

let me explain cramer s jp morgan is a fortress tweet let s get the obvious out of the way first cramer is a vehicle to subtly coordinate market actions without exposing too much manipulation risk you know it i know it we all know it inverse cramer works because being wrong on the overt advice helps hide the collusion so the trick is what s he really saying jp morgan and fortress as some have already pointed out what else is a fortress a citadel so that s our starting point let s look at major news involving the two citadel poaches python developer from jp morgan mcguire spent the past eighteen and a half years at jpmorgan where he was most recently an executive director in quantitative research on the bank s athena team athena is jpmorgan s risk and pricing engine which is coded in python at citadel mcguire will be a quantitative software engineer based in new york city recruiters say the big demand now is for quants who are python experts hedge funds like citadel need python developes to work on software that can back test trading strategies so citadel picks up this guy to backtest new trade strategies end of 2021 this year in a month s time will be the end of the bull run as the market slides into bear territory who gets obliterated through 2022 just about every ipo since 2020 see citadel came to prominence over hft and trade confirmation technology they definitely do not take advantage of pfof to front run customers through any trading apps let s take a peek at one of those trading apps just a random one timely news so here s my belief citadel gets reamed on their trades early 2021 by retail surge they have to bail out their own plotkin and such they re pissed and want to make up their balance sheet and then some they poach this guy to develop a more aggressive strategy perhaps tapping deeper into contract premiums and hedging those contracts with traditional stocks bought and sold in no particular order mind you adhering to t2 i bet it works great revenue pours in and citadel makes something like 18 billion in profit through the very bearish 2022 tons generated from retailbought options on startups and everything else that fall flat through the year oops maybe a little too aggressive they back off beginning of 2023 market downward pressure relaxes for a bit of a bumpexcept now every one in entities that invest heavily in start ups many from silicon valley are nuked those fronting the actual cash start pulling their money out there s also something about jp morgan citadel and automated repo confirmation with maketaxxess but i m a dummy so now jimmy boy is bumping elbows across the cnbc airwaves and twittersphere yo dawg check out jp morgan and fortress things get your ducks in a row might yolo selling some itm calls on rh but i m also kind of a pussy

uvix play go balls deep make money dear my fellow wallstreetbets brethen i am writing to provide you with a well regarded due diligence report on why going long on uvix now could result in u making hella tendies on wednesday i m so confident on this play i m willing to take a one week ban if uvix doesn t spike from its current price after fomc $1021 at this time of writing first and foremost it is important to understand what uvix is and how it operates uvix is an exchangetraded note etn that tracks the performance of the sp 500 vix shortterm futures index the vix also known as the fear index is a measure of the stock market s volatility and is used by investors to gauge the level of fear or stress in the market the market has been soaring ever since fb and amzn earnings which is understandable but uvix being a volatility gauge being at all time lows before such a week filled with important events already how fomc a bunch of pressure on the markets a 25bps increase would push the fed interest rate to levels not seen since 2007 it is worth noting that uvix is a leveraged etn which means that its price movements are magnified compared to the underlying index this means even though you ll be purchasing shares which i recommend only because iv on the call options are high you ll still make nice tendies it s down over 7 today and it s near all time lows currently at $1021 this presents a juicy opportunity to get in at the lows before a massive catalytic event this literally can t go tits up as with any investment it is important to do your own research and assess your personal risk tolerance as did the wise controlthenarrative did before making a decision just kidding go as balls deep as you can on shares and rejoice by the end of this week tldr go long uvix rn best regards a wsb elder edit currently up to $1077 up around 52 on shares in less than 3 hours edit 2 uvix up 22 today currently trading at 1301 i recommend taking profits at these levels but of course it s up to you

my yolo story continues this is the sequel of my yolo post about my $100k going all in cvna calls earlier this year i was about to give up hope many times when it went down more than 80 but i chose to let it be it all went back during the month of expiration 616 and i still ended up with over 300 gain i continued to invest in combination of calls and stocks cvna ai and rivn later on i know i was so lucky that i got all them right and i was also able to dodge the cvna big drop from over $50 to $40 sold most at $52 and picked back up today at $4054 and ended up with another 170k gain on a single day today i guess i am gonna play safer and i only hold a small portion of options and the rest for shares have spent a lot of time on the housing market and hopefully i can get my dream house glta

why its time for $qcom fellow degenerates qualcomm qcom already is a huge established player in the mobile chip market it pretty much has a monopoly if you ignore apple their pe ratio is 2140 in comparison to amd s 88 and nvidia s 93 it s fucking cheap but i hear you think who cares about these mobile phone chips with their gimmicky ai features no one is talking about the following and i think qualcomm can be a gem so besides them being already established in the phone market nobody is talking about the following 1 qualcomm shaking up the cpu market qualcomm is about to turn the windows cpu market into its personal playground it s going to be bringing arm chips yes the technology that made apple s m chips insanely superior over these shitty windows chips as they are so much more expensive no one wants to walk around with these fugly thick windows laptops qualcomm is going to be the first one to change it and will have the first mover advantage even if they dont win the market the market is growing insanely fast and is huge the pie is big enough qualcomm has good connections with tsmc who produces their apples chips it s a nobrainer i did the math on another post simply comparing benchmarks shows that they have a fair shot at apple s m3 meaning thin windows laptops with insane increases in battery life no more jet engine sounds 2 inference chips actually a contender for nvidia and nobody is talking about this you have ai 100 cards which do the actual ai heavy lifting and not the bullshit gimmicky phone ai stuff in aidata centers they are making the ai 100 ultra it s a serious contender for nvidia s h100 and benchmark info is available online 3 the ai hype potential besides all the prior i mentioned it being underpriced already fundamentally a good company but also going to singlehandedly turn the windows laptops and desktop market upside down in addition to competing with nvidia in the ai inference world it s prone to being hyped up if this nvidia crazyness continues people will be looking for the next nvidia and this is a great contender x200b x200b
disney a sleeper stock am i regard i currently have 40 shares of disney avg at $88 i recently bought two long calls $115 break even $125 for jan 2025 and down about 14 hindsight i should ve bought them sooner however that aside they have already cut billions in cost they ousted chapek that was fucking everything up and bob iger has extended his return disney plus is looking to be profitable eoy they are mainstreaming their sports through espn along with adding espn bet parks have also been a higher earner for them but i could see them honestly hitting $150$200 this year which they were above $200 just before iger stepped down originally am i regard the shareholder meeting is coming up to change the board room but they are looking solid

some dd notes on nvda with sources just sharing some quick dd notes on nvda with sources would like any feedback will paste lot more if there is any interest notessource1source2 based on nvidia s consistent growth the price of nvidia s stocks to increase over the next trimester nvidia s q3 reports show stable growth demonstrating the company s resilience despite a fluctuating economy this growth is most likely due to its constant technological innovations and relentless effort to stay ahead this strength and persistence paint a promising picture of the nvidia s future potential for investors nvidia s stock price climbing in the longterm as the company is becoming increasingly involved in highgrowth sectors nvidia isn t just a gpu maker for pcs anymore it s become a key player in large highgrowth markets such as data centers artificial intelligence and selfdriving cars this change in strategic direction has opened several new revenue streams that could boost the company s financial performance and by extension its stock price there is a high chance that nvidia s stock price will surge in the next financial quarter due to the value the brand holds nvidia is not simply another tech company it s appreciated and valued for its topnotch quality and innovation with a strong brand value and customer loyalty nvidia can withstand market uncertainties better than most therefore as long as the company continues to uphold its reputation for excellence we can expect a positive trend in the stock s performance nvidia s stock price could experience a boost in the next few years this prediction stems from the possibility of nvidia s increased revenue through its involvement in gaming devices nvidia s gpus have been hailed as the heart and soul of gaming pcs and demand is only growing as gaming becomes ever more popular and advanced nvidia s prominence in this sector should continue to provide a solid foundation for growth there is a likelihood of nvidia s stock price rising steadily due to their diversified business portfolio nvidia isn t solely dependent on one product it has several operations including data centers ai gaming and more this diversification reduces risk and increases the chances of seeing consistent growth in their stock price another strength of nvidia is its ability to innovate within these sectors which is necessary to stay competitive in the fastpaced tech industry nvidia will continue to dominate the gpu market given its pattern of successful acquisitions their strategy of purchasing innovative companies as seen with the acquisition of arm allows them to integrate cuttingedge technologies and stay ahead of competition if they continue this strategy they will likely keep their market leader status as they are not only producing highquality gpus but also creating a tech conglomerate with a range of capabilities nvidia s expansion into ai and datacenters following their acquisition of mellanox suggests they will become a significant player in these fields too the integration of mellanox s interconnect technology amplifies nvidia s datacenter capabilities thus positioning them favorably to cater to increasing global data demands so their market influence is likely to spread beyond traditional gpudominance to these new arenas with nvidia s interest and investment in autonomous driving technologies i predict a future where they are pivotal in the automobile industry the acquisition of deepmap a company specializing in highdefinition mapping solutions for autonomous vehicles aligns well with this futurefocused strategy therefore nvidia s impact is likely to go beyond the tech sector influencing the automotive industry significantly nvidia s ongoing success in gaming spurred by its gpu innovations will likely position it as a key company in the virtual reality vr industry gaming is intrinsically tied to vr and nvidia s penchant for staying ahead of trends suggests they may soon make strategic acquisitions in this space too if this happens we could see nvidia becoming as dominant in vr as they have in gpus nvidia to increasingly venture into the mobile device market given their acquisition of arm a leader in mobile processors as smartphones and other mobile devices become more powerful and integral to everyday life it makes sense for nvidia to position itself in this burgeoning market with arm s technology they may eventually rival or even surpass companies like qualcomm in mobile processing capabilities in the future nvidia could be seen as a major cloud computing company their acquisition of swiftstack a data storage software company signifies an interest in bolstering their cloud infrastructure as businesses continue to migrate to the cloud nvidia s investments here may well pay off leading them to become a leading figure in cloud computing services nvidia is expected to maintain market leadership in the coming years due to its innovative potential its continuous investment and promise in research have helped the company stay ahead of the curve and thus enable them to invent cuttingedge technologies for the tech industry this pattern of innovation has helped them outperform many stocks in the sp 500 and there s no reason this trend can t continue we can expect nvidia to outperform other stocks in the sp 500 due to the ongoing digital transformation as businesses continue to shift towards digitization there will be an increased demand for nvidia s gpus these gpus play a vital role in supporting the computational needs of today s digital infrastructure so as this trend continues nvidia is likely to further strengthen its market position given the rise in cryptocurrency nvidia s future looks bright cryptocurrency miners use nvidia s gpus extensively so as crypto continues to gain traction nvidia s demand will likely follow suit this surge in demand could lead to a significant rise in nvidia s stock value further solidifying their status in the sp 500 nvidia s outlook is strong due to the growing field of autonomous vehicles nvidia s technology is vital in this industry providing the computational power needed to make selfdriving cars a reality given the projected growth in this space we can anticipate an increase in nvidia s stock performance in the future predicting a constant rise in the nvda stock due to technology s persistent growth it is expected that the advancement in technology especially in ai technology will continually push the demand for nvidia s products their highperformance chips have a significant role in data centers gaming and autonomous driving cars as long as these sectors keep thriving nvidia s stock will likely follow an upward trajectory expecting nvidia stock to skyrocket based on the exponential growth in computing power demand with technology s progression becoming more dataintensive and complex the need for highpowered processors like nvidia s is predicted to soar nvda s place as a market leader in the gpu space reinforces this prediction anticipating nvidia s stock value to increase due to its expansion into new market areas the company recently acquired arm holdings a critical player in the microprocessor industry and they ve expanded their portfolio into the display technology with their gsync monitors their ability to successfully venture into new market areas indicates a potential growth in stock price the stock may suffer shortterm fluctuations but will maintain an upward trend in the long run due to nvidia s consistent investment in research and development research and development is a cornerstone of nvidia s strategy and they re consistently developing new powerful models of gpus and exploring new technologies like ray tracing this consistent evolution will keep nvidia relevant and competitive in the technology market bolstering the stock s performance nvidia stocks could see a continued rise owing to their broadened product portfolio from powering supercomputers to gaming systems and data centers nvidia s highly diversified product range shields the company from sectorspecific downturns ensuring a steady revenue stream consequently the stock is more likely to maintain an upward trend expecting nvda s stock to increase due to strong financial management the company has demonstrated a consistent record of revenue

arm put thesis i don t ever post here don t listen to anything i say that you don t understand i don t ever trade options i m posting because i hate the banking cabal controlling stock prices one of them is obviously on the ropes and collateral damage is likely from their collapse here s the simple arm put thesis softbank owns 90 of arms outstanding shares softbanks market cap is already trading below the value of this 1 asset the writing is on the wall that they are running into a liquidity issue and those 90 of arm shares will be trading hands it is likely that when that happens the price will fall no one really can know when so long dated puts make the most sense that s it that simple do your own due diligence though

bbby is in for a major run up says my highly regarded analysis these ftds are they in the room with us right now i m going to keep this brief and get straight to the point ftd s are very likely to be the cause of major runups in bbby ftd data will tell us that ftds are resolved magically in their following trading days but the experienced apes among us from the gme saga will know that firms like shitadel and suspecthana are masters at hiding ftd from cropping up that why bbby not being on regsho s threshold list doesn t really matter look at this chart every runup big or small has always been after a major ftd due date each run occurs on average 35 trading days after when they become due although the size of each run varies as they are also subject to fundamental factors like news x200b we are wrong about t35 i think i m sure most of us have seen this table below i believe the t35 dates are wrong here x200b this is what t35 actually means taken from the sec s website taken from https so it s 35 calendar days following the trade date so looking at the table above for the settlement date of 20220812 there was a total of 293k new ftd s and the t35 date is stated to be 20220916 however that s 35 days after the settlement date not the trade date since we have t2 settlement the new ftd s from 12 aug were actual fails from the trades made 2 trading days prior which is 10 aug the table below shows the corrected t35 dates x200b settlement datetrade dateincorrect t35 datecorrected t35 date 20220812202208102022091620220914 20220811202208092022091520220913 20220810202208082022091420220912 20220809202208052022091320220909 20220808202208042022091220220908 x200b why is this t2 important because new ftd s generated are very correlated with the trading volume of that trade given date not settlement date during the 4th10th august runup new ftd s were approximately 049 of the trading volumes on those given trading days during the 7th july spike $bbby closed 217 new ftd s were as staggering 4 of trading volume x200b looking forward with available ftd data the latest ftd data we have currently is up until the settlement date of 12th august where we can see trades from the 4th of august to the 10th of august had generated 16m new ftd s which start becoming due from 8th to 14th of september trade dateftds createdt35 due date 20220810293 74020220914 20220809425 98320220913 20220808685 88820220912 20220805178 00220220909 2022080439 84320220908 x200b adding them to the first chart we get this we can expect a move up from the 8th of september doesn t look like much but stay with me x200b here s where the fun begins we know that new ftds are closely correlated with trading volume anywhere from 05 up to 4 of trading volume since the latest ftd data doesn t cover the runup from the 11th of august onwards lets take a look at what those ftds might look like using different percentages x200b low estimate ftds are 05 of trading volume 0537 of trading volume fail to deliver x200b moderate estimate ftds are 1 of trading volume 137 of trading volume fail to deliver x200b high estimate ftds are 3 of trading volume 337 of trading volume fail to deliver even if a meager 05 of trading volume become ftds from 11 aug onwards we are looking at a pretty sizeable runup at 1 the potential runup looks to be roughly twice the size of the aug 15 spike at 3 the aug 15 looks like a bad joke x200b where does this leave us shits gonna blow lmaooo x200b disclaimer not financial advice i m highly regarded holding sept 16 13c s and jan 20 60c s so make of that what you will
$dis is looking good for a long call let me explain from a technical and fundamental analysis standpoint why i think disney stock is ready for a long call preferably at the $100 strike jan 2025 but first look at my crayons before i explain my crayons on $dis chart now basically disney stock has been getting beaten down hard while the rest of the market parties now you might think yeah it s gonna go lower get fucked but this is disney were talking about they are simply to big to get fucked now you might be saying oo they ve been losing money and they are going to keep losing money and you know you d be right but you have to buy stocks when everyone else doesn t want them i mean no one wanted meta when zuck was fucking up with vr shit and losing billions or tesla when elon was buying twitter and cutting prices or even banks like western allegiance or pacwest when bank stocks were getting fucked hard but if you bought then when it seemed like an obvious throw of money well you d of bought at the bottom so now i saw this doesn t this look similar doesn t everyone think disney is fucked yes obviously would you seem like a regard for going long on it yes of course but fundamentally disney has been around for about a hundred years and it s not going anywhere so for a well known company like that i think this price is very fair now could it go lower maybe in the mid 80 s but this is absolutely a turning point it s struggling to even go any lower and from a technical standpoint it s very difficult for disney to fall lower from this level why because at some point investors realize a price is so low they know it s a discount and they are gonna keep buying and besides my crayons saying that this is a good buying point i think that disney understands better now what works and doesn t for their films and over time this lesson will translate to billions of dollars in profit now as for the trade well as you know disney is very oversold and at a strong demand zone that keeps it from falling lower with the market already having fallen so much i think it s fair to say that if you are a bull and believe the market will go up then it s fair to say that disney will get some of that upside and even if you are a bear in the market you must acknowledge disney s ability to not go lower in price indicating that this is a strong bottom so even if you are bearish or bullish on the market it doesn t fucking matter because disney is for sure going to do one thing and that is go up i think the safest and best way to go about this trade would be as said previously to buy some jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options because even if you aren t certain disney will go up in the near term or do well as a company you can at least be certain that some point in 1 and a half years it will have a technical bounce and those calls will print at least a 20 gain tldr get disney jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options because it s technicals are very bullish and it s likely to bounce as well as fundamentally the fact that when companies are doing shit they are a great buy with low downside risk especially when they have clearly bottomed out like disney

do people forget we re in an election year and that the market is most likely going to finish green end of year i m seeing a lot of bearish posts in this sub and other sub reddits are people forgetting that this is an election year and if we look at historical trends a majority of these years finish in the green if you guys don t think those in power will cut rates and artificially boost the economy for reelection purposes then you are deluded i can certainly see a recession coming in 2025 but i m fairly certain jpow and his crew along with many other wealthy people are going to do their best to show that the current administration has cultivated one of the strongest economies despite inflation wars etc and if reelection happens things will go to absolute shit the next year short 2025 folks and not 2024
rumors in india of reliance group of mukesh ambani to be behind hindenburg research to be behind the hit job on adani group reliance group for several decades has been a near monopoly in some of the most lucrative businesses in india such as energy petroleum and power etc and a major beneficiary of government policies due to its closeness to top politicians from both ends of the spectrum however since 2014 it has been adani group which has become the biggest beneficiary of the government policies and it has entered several business areas in which reliance has been a near monopoly or entered in recent years to drive its growth both these groups compete in infrastructure power food agriculture business like grain storage for government export of food grains and in retail telecom and news channels business etc by bringing down adani reliance may not only regain the political influence it wishes to have for itself but also be able to scoop up some of the adani group companies for peanuts the collateral damage of the fight between these 2 giants may be india s largest bank and insurance company which are government owned and maybe the whole of indian banking system indian currency inr and the indian economy as well

the final fib where to next in my previous post i explained the significance of what i believed to be the final fibonacci retracement level before a complete collapse since then the market has followed a very predictable pattern we are currently stuck between two significant levels the 3618 fib 12 13358 ixic and 4236 fib 11 48997 ixic i have posted an example of the chart below x200b final fib marked by red line 11 48997 as you can see in the chart above predicting directionality at the convergence point of the fib line is fairly difficult if the fib is rejected to the upside there is an argument for a significant rally if it is rejected to the downside the opposite is true so how do we know technical analysis is nearly useless on its own during significant pivot points in this case algorithmic trading will most likely be overshadowed by manual traders and market psychology so we have to ask a few questions what is the prevailing sentiment of the market are there any indicators of stress that would make buying into a rally inherently risky do we believe that corporations leaders and ceos are competent enough to remain solvent during a crisis here are some interesting statistics that may be relevant according to ipo trackers 1 050 ipos in the year 2021 alone here is a chart for reference x200b in 1999 there were 478 ipos listed and in 2000 there were 397 this was immediately preceding hundreds of ipos announcing insolvency now look at 2021 here s a fun fact only 200 of those 1035 ipos from 2021 have positive returns and only 100 with returns above 1 gain companies have been burning through cash scrambling to get their name and stock ticker out to the public and i believe we are near a breaking point so where are we going it is my belief that when technical analysis fails sentiment will no longer be able to prop up equities funds continue to liquidate at alarming rates and bankruptcydelisting filings are skyrocketing capital is drying up and the share repurchase agreements corporations have enacted are running out of steam so when faced with the question of where we go from here i believe the cliche answer lies in the same fallacies found repeated over and over in markets 1929 2000 and 2008 are so often referenced that they have almost been beaten into the ground however the psychology of markets remains the same we have not will not or simply refuse to learn from our mistakes and that will be our downfall once again game set match and it was rigged from the start
why i m getting tesla puts a deep dive into earnings a must read guys it s happening tesla is releasing their earnings today after close at 530 pm et they ve already reported production and delivery data for the fourth quarter yesterday i said netflix was gonna go up and to get call spreads and we made fucking bank the stock is up massively today 3x gains on the spread easy money now it s time for a new post they ve already flexed their q4 muscles with some big numbers cranking out nearly 495k vehicles and delivering about 485k of those bad boys mostly the model 3 and model y these recordhigh quarterly deliveries are due to declining prices with the average transaction price for a tesla vehicle at $50 051 in december a more than 25 drop from the previous year that s how they hit a wild 181 million deliveries for 2023 up 38 from the year before last quarter musk said the price cuts were ineffective due to high interest rates since then the fed has indicated that rate cuts are coming in 2024 although pricing pressure could still take a toll on tesla s earnings still thanks to the challenges tesla has been facing including heightened competition in the ev market price cuts and more the market s not expecting fireworks for tesla s fourth quarter the consensus estimate for net sales is $257 billion reflecting yearoveryear growth of 59 despite this forecast for modest revenue growth analysts are less optimistic about tesla s other results wall street is expecting a decline in all of the other lines of tesla s income statement due not only to more modest revenue but also to lower margins it s not all sunshine and rainbows here s what the consensus is expecting gross profit might drop 19 to $467 billion ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization could fall 223 to $419 billion net income down 361 to $26 billion eps earnings per share 74 cents a 381 decline so yeah the market s bracing for tesla to take some hits thanks to the rough ride in the ev market and macroeconomic headwinds what i m going to be paying attention to when looking at a company s earnings report or listening in on an earnings call it s crucial that you pay attention to several factors for one thing tesla must address its shortterm challenges and how the company s management is handling issues related to price cuts and uncertainties about subsidies it s even more critical that investors gain an understanding of how these factors will play out in the coming quarters also any comments on tesla s game plan for the ev rat race will be extremely important it s not just about byd creeping up in the rearview but also about all the other drama cooling down the ev scene like the sale of tesla vehicles by hertz htz it s also essential that management comment on tesla s newly released cybertruck including how well the vehicle is performing saleswise and how it could contribute to future quarters as usual any guidance will be extremely important and could also impact tesla s stock especially if it varies from what the consensus is expecting so what now tesla s in a tight spot the fourthquarter earnings results are important not only so that we can see how tesla performed in 2023 but also so that investors can understand the strategies that the company is adopting to deal with its challenges in this crazy market it s not just about the dollars and cents it s about tesla s moves to dodge the obstacles and their vision for 2024 i don t wanna bet against the musk but i ll be grabbing puts for earnings on average the stock tends to move 8 so i ll be getting tsla 126 195p 284 no spreads this time regardless just like my other posts this isn t financial advice i d like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play this hopefully will help you with future earning plays too we have intc later this week too

saudi arabia shakes up oil market in latest opec meeting saudi arabia will voluntarily withdraw an additional 1 million barrels per day from the market abdulaziz bin salman wasn t warning us for no reason in other aspects though not much has changed the restrictions implemented in april have been extended until 2024 but this implies increased production as starting january 1st the unfilled quotas of african countries members will transition to the uae which has the most unused capacity in opec without prince abdulaziz the meeting s results would likely have been bearish for prices however the potentially negative impact on prices from the quota reallocation in favor of the uae is vastly overshadowed by saudi arabia s impactful statement that being said its implementation remains questionable still prices are likely to jump $23 tomorrow if not more

travel long play at the start of the pandemic i made good money with some cruise and airline stocks buying the immediate dip and holding out for a little personally my family just booked a flight to miami for a vacation and everyone i know is rushing to book vacations the demand for travel has been back for a bit but some travel companies are lower than pre covid levels i am planning a long play on a whole bundle of travel stocks as i think they are severely undervalued i know for a fact i will dump a large sum of money into ac air canada even on their 5 year chart they are stupidly low and i know the canadian gov will bail them out if anything goes sour they are the only real national airline in canada i understand there may be some debt problems but i still think these prices are low this is a long play and i am planning on just buying and holding for minimum a year i am a kid and trade on my dads account every dollar i made working these past summers since 2019 has been dumped into stocks and i have been relatively positive any advice or thoughts on my upcoming play is appreciated thanks

half of y all are the equivalent of a german living in berlin during april 1945 read the room and make money from it pov you re hanz diamenthanden living in berlin everydaynight there are massive bombing formations pummeling your city you actively see soldiers setting up defenses all around the city you can hear firefights in the distance and there s a shortage of literally everything like food water and power all the while the government and chaplain mustache looking guy are going all over the radio and tv talking about how well the war is going and that they are going to win within the next few weeks the rationing is merely transitory put at ease hanz then injects his life savings into reich bonds lmao obviously this is an extreme case comparison but there is a massive thread that runs between the two and one of the most intriguing differences that benefit us is we have a massive opportunity to make money from the shake up that will inevitably come you have seen first hand literally everything in your life skyrocket in price after they printed 60 of the dollars ever created in 2 years while the government has only said everything is fine i don t blame them for it if they came out and said we re screwed think about the reaction inflation is an empire killer that is for sure and the dollar is probably one of the most if not the most important pillar of americas global power papa powell and even a career politician biden seessaw this and to that extent they will literally doggie style the markets and economy to save the dollar period this has severely messed with the risk free rate that is the corner stone of modern finance your standard newbie wall street bro will even use the current treasury rate as their own discount rate in valuing equities lets take a look at the 10 year treasury rate since april 2020 x200b httpsychartscomindicators10yeartreasuryrate that is more than a 5fold increase in a matter of two years that is simply unprecedented everyone loves to think of the volcker days and interest rates in the 1970s lets take a quick peak x200b https we can see that big balls volcker only raised rates from the start of his term to the max by a mere 100 over the course of 4 years while powell said hold my beer and has absolutely launched them to the moon in 7 months the best part is that real rates are still supremely negative by over 4 lmao the hope and prayer from the fed is that this shock treatment will scare the economy in such a way that it will cool rapidly if julyaugust taught us anything of the psychology of the market right now is it is still a speculative permabull environment that will latch on to anything and puuuuump on a wing and a prayer get in control of your emotions take advantage of this inefficiency and make some money don t feel comfortable being a bear edge lord remember in times like these cash is king plays let me start and say do not short the hole or your normie butt will get wiped out personally i prefer to short through options and do not buy contracts when the vix is elevated or you ll get churned wait for a bear market rallythere were like 16 in dot com bubble burst of greater than 20 and vix to be 20 and make your play i have been greatly successful in shorting treasuries as interest rates rise because the bond market has been extremely emotional and inefficient most recently the easing that took place over july saw rates tumble for no reason at all other than investor greed and presented amazing opportunity tlt positions note merrill has a fucked up position mapping and i m way to lazy to chop and sort it after writing this novel on equities specifically the naz being full of shitcos same concept applies and this is where i somewhat was a virgin and should have had the balls to take some more risk in terms of position size but it is what it is conclusion i d like to finish this by saying that yes i have a bearish outlook in terms of market prices but this isn t a perma bear scenario where the economy will be screwed for life after the shakeup it will create new ground for a bull market to form businesses will still continue to grow and make profit it is just the price people are willing to pay for it will change just as berlin got crushed for decades after the fall in 1945 look at it todayignore energy issues apart of the economic powerhouse of europe
does bear market equal recession historically the us stock market have entered into bear market 7 times since 1950 by a definition of 20 slump from peak or 10 times if the slump range was loosen to 18 the most recent bear just arrived last week with sp500 declined over 22 since jan 3 but not all these thunders have brought rain economic numbers showed that among the 10 bears only 4 leaded to real recession 2 were associated with mild recession and the rest were just false signals it also could be a mistake if you regard the bear market as an indicator of recession on the contrary it usually lags when the market turned into bear in 1982 the recession just entered its second year in 1973 and 2008 the us gdp has been suffering contraction for consecutive 2 qs before the bear market arrives bear market is more likely a consequence of economic decline a brief of recession and bear market now we know the real gdp contracted 15 at q1 2022 yet the majority still believe it is going to be positive at q2 2022 given the 50year low unemployment rate today we should understand their optimism may not be overvalued this time the bear market is likely to be a false
the only way for the global economy to recover is for me to pull all my money out of the market but my fomo won t allow it my investment choices have the ability to reverse market trends money in market down money out market up despite this i m willing to tank the global economy and stand fast in the hopes that maybe it s all a coincidence or i m paranoid or just a born loser with no investment sense we ll see we shall see

why i yolo d on newegg part 2 yup i yolo d my portfolio yup i m the egghead who posted my yolo on newegg negg here s my position below and i m all in the other $2 000 i have in some call options that ll surely expire worthless soon enough and the other 503 shares are in a highly speculative penny stock that ll probably go to zero at a sloth like pace slow enough that i ll just keep holding it until i finally sell it at 3 pennies and feel like a smart trader for not selling at 0 anyway source here s that wsb post if you want to see https now i can tell you why i m yolo ing everything into this company i ve been buying computer parts from newegg for as long as i can remember and they fall into that category of companies like gme amc bb bbby that are getting displaced newegg perhaps by amazon and maybe best buy that said the fundamentals of the company look sound and i found some good dd that i ll share below i m collecting this dd here so its all in one place for you to explain my egghead journey mary f ing poppins this company has popped more times then there have been mary poppins movies so more than twice fools every few months this pops but now this newegg has been beat up unfairly looking at the chart i like what i see a nice downward trend and lots of sharp prickly spikes up none of that slow up movement that i would get bored with i m here for all or nothing plays source https the previous due diligence first i checked out some of the dd from very reliable resources ie stocktwits the king of all reliable and truthful information there s been a few rumblings on newegg stock ticker negg and i ve been watching the stocktwits board for some dd this full on scrambled egghead made a dd as a picture that seems to check out i copied the meme and i suggest you make one too if you got nothing out of this on wallstbets there s been recent dd posts which i believe to be solid this post made me buy in this post was also made and it checks out that the float of this ticker is low i like these low floaters the float is around 12 million shares and i think due for a moon landing soon i ll talk about why it s unfairly beaten down again towards the end the financial situation watching the recent sith lord move by ryan cohen on bbby it made me nervous on companies bbby is slapping rc in the face right now though so it s all good anyway i took a look at neweggs financials before my major yolo move normally i just buy call options and pray to the spy lords but again the eggs were cheap enough to buy a massive amount newegg is profitable by a decent enough and a growing profit margin could be a big catalyst if they surprise on their earnings and if their earnings suck that s probably better for so i can buy more cheap eggs either way i m just trying to get as many eggs as possible here source https the salesrevenue for 2021 of 238b exceeds the market cap fluctuating between 13 and 16 billion recently again mostly i just liked seeing green on the profit section i rarely see green these days so any green is pleasant i like online businesses as well because they seem to scale a bit better newegg has the growth potential the growth potential on this one seems really strong based on where the price has been in the past 52weeks this has been has high as $2220 18 months ago it say $79 and has been unfairly beaten down to the 3s range where it stands currently there are probably some bag holders here in the 10s or maybe higher the current bag holders are likely holding a good percentage of the 12 million float insiders are holding about 97 of the shares right now so that s where the 12 million float figure checks out i suspect insiders are going to be holding this for a while and waiting for a bigger recovery right now it looks like about 40 of the stock is shorted and rising rapidly source https thesis and catalysts the short volume is consistently above 60 which implies short interest is going to keep rising folks just believe that people aren t buying computers anymore which is silly i think newegg should normalize to a more fair evaluation maybe 810 dollar range that d put around a 12x multiple on the gross profits to reach a market cap over 4 billion that is brought in that s a normalish to where this stock has been the 200 daily moving average for instance held around the 7s most of the summer see source below gme and amc had longer runs but i think newegg spikes violently up and then it ll float around that 810 zone and drift slowly up or down after newegg has an earnings report coming up so i think if they report good earnings some shorts may start to close position for a mini bump thinking modest maybe a spike to $56 if it s a crap earning report i think this will get shorted more and then its even more of a rocket move later in the year around black friday sales with nvidia s earning report somewhat sucking i think newegg is in a position to start getting some more leverage newegg launched a new laptop finder tool and has been doing a few other developer events to get the word out back to school sales hybrid work and the general refresh should help keep sales coming in strong newegg has a good direct to consumer and direct to business options they also have more recently a way to finance payments using affirm for example that is very consumer friendly i think management is making a lot of right decisions to grow the business and i think negg management is waiting to grow the company and let their eggs hatch when the time is right the time is right when the eggs get very big think ostrich size eggs not the eggs you get at the grocery store daily moving averages https this stock was beaten down unfairly in december of 2020 the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa said they were basically going to audit a bunch of foreign ie ali baba like companies i think since newegg has chinese ownership they were lumped into this category after actually taking 5 seconds to run a ctrlf on the list here newegg was not to be found i believe the slow drop in price this summer has been fud spreading see the next bullet though according to this story here released today august 28 uschina relations just got better as they figured out a process again newegg was never involved or at risk of delisting but the fud spread wild and the price dripped down did i buy some eggs as you now know i m putting almost all my eggs in one basket here and now have a position of about 14 100 shares at newegg it fits in to my red portfolio and i m going to buy more eggs and tell you about it here papa powell wants to make it hard on me to make money this year it looks like but i think now is as good a time as ever to dive in if it goes lower and my trash portfolio gets obliterated i ll just make some scrambled eggs at my new job at mcdonalds morning shift what kind of egghead are you i m a hard boiled egg so consider buying some eggs now or just post a bunch of bad egg jokes here i don t care more egg jokes more profits for us all when we get to the egg farts we know we re winning we will run to the moon in great fear when we smell egg farts aristotle so remember 1 buy computer parts preferably from newegg 2 put your eggs in this basket i heard the easter bunny won t like you for taking his eggs though 3 this ticker keeps popping every few months the lower share price means rocket time 4 this ticker for now fits perfectly in my all red portfolio until i take the shorts eggs for $$$
calling it frc is the first of many mega bank run frauds x200b one quick look at their balance sheet and you ll notice there s very little bond exposure this is not bond related almost all are mortgages and the rest is in state municipal securities this is an ol fashioned taxpayer cash grab by private equity firms doing a coordinated bank run on first republic bank then using the infinite deposit cheat code to get their original deposit backzero risk plus whatever they can pull out of the bank and option plays x200b these firms need to be jailed and barred from doing business in the usa or undo infinite deposit protection

gold xauusd forex 160922 the market broke through the main support level i think that if the price makes retracement to the resistance zone at 166510 after we can see further downward move i expect some pullback then sell if price rolls back to it my goal is the support level at 1640000 to follow my analysis and signals you can join me x200b
i started gambling like you guys well my style of it i bought an iron condor this afternoon probably morning for those west of the atlantic ocean in spx one contract expiry today spread between short options 30 points spread between short and long on each side 20 points maximum profitloss around 1000 each with implied probability around 50 it s like putting 1000 on black in roulette at closing price of spx i m at a profit of around 400 not bad for a day my main goal was to figure out if the iron condor is treated by the broker as one trade or four because that makes a big tax difference here but it was albeit small a thrilling gamble

us banks are grossly over leveraged the coming downgrades are warranted in march 2023 when all the medium sized banks started imploding one by one the primary topic of discussion was terrible risk management and us treasuries losses now there is a new threat that is maybe 1000x worse derivatives and swaps at the big banks i found it interesting that fitch came out with their warning today and jp morgan was the primary suspect these are the top 5 us banks with hidden derivatives on their books x200b 1 jpmorgan chase bank na $54t 2 goldman sachs bank usa $50t 3 citibank national assn $45t 4 bank of america na $21t 5 wells fargo bank na $12t page 18 of the occ s report the occ s definition of a derivative a financial contract in which the value is derived from the performance of underlying market factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity credit and equity prices derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts such as structured debt obligations and deposits swaps futures options caps floors collars forwards and various combinations thereof x200b now late last year the bank of international settlements did warn us this was something nobody was paying attention to currently one of the biggest concerns is japan everyone expects the bank of japan to keep buying bonds and keeping its currency in check there is a massive risk if they lose control and all these swaps begin to unwind the treasury losses at the fed will look like peanuts the economic data out of china has been shockingly bad this is another major risk as their real estate sector is actively imploding and the us is seeing a rapid decline in commercial real estate values what i m looking for is to hear from the other 2 rating agencies sp and moody s they have been very quiet there is also the brics meeting next week a lot of discussion about dedollarization another risk to the us x200b i don t think anyone on wallstreet will sell burry credit default swaps anymore so im guessing that s why he went with puts x200b buffett and munger talked about the dangers of derivatives at one of their shareholder meets can be found on youtube x200b x200b x200b

2nd attempt at submitting a trading idea for june with the success of maverick this weekend and jurrasic park etal on tap both geared for massive theater screens wondering if imax has a chance to catch fire or get picked up as a meme stock similar to amc this summer the ceo is very enthusiastic and personable see clip below and the stock hasn t really done much in 10 years flat for the year so hasn t moved much this year either anyway i watchlisted it and if it continues to break out started to move friday i think it might catch the attention of some meme stock traders in amc or gme this week x200b a few comparables to note $imax market cap 940m shares outstanding 5857m 10 of shares sold short down 25 ytd $amc market cap 632 billion shares outstanding 438m shares sold short down 48 ytd cnbc interview from friday with the 68 yr old ceo older gent but i bet he s been on reddit sounds like an interesting character and was spot on with his maverick comments what a typical weekend for the ceo was like in nyc gardening walks simple life seems to genuinely love movies and the joy they bring if interested in who s running the company should we make life way more interesting for him next few weeks stocks pe is 18 hasn t really done anything in last 1012 years just throwing it out as a long idea

navigating the next fomc meeting so the market is going to shit recently cause rising interest rates bad growth and just people having a dash for cash cause everyone is bamboozled by the economy i m no youtube economist but here s my two cents as of today the rates havnt been hiked because the feds think that inflation is temporary inflation should come back down why or how money is removed from circulation 1 recent swarm in real estate purchases at low rates is a safe house for cash some people park cash in gold some people park cash in houses russian oligarchs cough with so many mortgages locked in at low rates and home prices at aths it s a double entendre did inflation come first or did reckless spending come first 2 bank rates are raised but slowly why why is there a fear of recession if rates are raised too fast not everyone world wide has access to real estate or risk free bonds3 if rates are raised too fast the economy and world might go into full saving mode putting an end to spending 3 well with the roll out of the series i savings bond 89 interest locked in risk free is a steal for many americans this also outpaces the spy $10k per american locked up for 15 years 4 risk off already happened with the hike in prices many growth companies have come to a strong halt not only because of expenses but also people arnt willing to pay more for less now 5 the dollar has bounced back stronger than ever with the world in a dash for cash and countries failing the greenback will become really strong say hello to the 12 loonies the next fed meeting is in may 35 my guess is that rates will remain steady no big hikes growth will stall but risk taking will come back onto the market savers are forced to make a decision either invest in bonds the bigger stocks or real estate me think risk free bonds and big blues will be the go to but big blues will only be a place holder for many who are forced into a position outside of banks and fed notes of course there s always other things like inflation hedge digitals stagflation is not something that the feds will fear because it s something they can clearly step the breaks on when they want suffer short term get the economy back long term four day work weeks coming to your local office so everyone can continue to work at the same productivity tldr fed say we stick to plan market hits true bottom and you can clear out half your watch list fed say we raise rates faster all gains wiped out post 2018 feds say no hike forced risk on mode

qe for me qt for thee simple hypothesis for my fellow regards jpow don t give a fuck about you and me he s balling with his friends like jamie dimon so he has to help them out and the only tool he has to do it is an asset exchange facility where he can take long dated bonds off their balance sheets and let them go buy short dated tbills but at the same time his money honey jyell is telling him that he still has that little inflation thing to take care of or her sugar daddy joeb is going to go down in flames so what s a player to do is it bros before hoes or what jpow is like hold my beer here s what is up jpow is doing qe for the banks through his backstop facility printing money for them but in a way that isn t going to cause much inflation because it is technically an exchange program so that money doesn t make it to us ass clowns this takes the interest rate risk off the table for banks at the same time he is going to keep tightening on us regards by raising rates because he still wants to crush the jobs market and cool down inflation because let s face it he doesn t want to pay the pool boy more than minimum wage sure letting banks fail would have the same effect but then no one would come to his autobiography release party if he let the banks fail tldr qe for the banks qt for us and jpow comes off looking like a really stable genius

microsoft is still the most wellpositioned company in leveraging ai to generate revenue in the near future lol man oh man people on this sub are on the spectrum and not the good kind microsoft didn t announce that they will make $10 trillion dollars in ai revenue this quarter so people are losing their minds nothing has changed other than that they beat literally every single earnings expectation they are still the most aggressive and well positioned company on earth to utilize ai technology to make insane amounts of money the fact that they are expecting to see huge profits by 2024 is a huge achievement in itself azure sales growth actually slightly exceeded market expectations lol so if you thought microsoft was a good buy yesterday it s an even better buy today in literally every way imaginable anyway looking at the bright side if microsoft opens tomorrow with a big red dildo this is actually a healthy draw back before reaching another ath tldr buy puts because i bought calls

is meta the long term play of the century i may be one of the most bearish people i know right now $220 spy puts 2025 and i think i ll be comfortably itm but if i was going to invest in a single tech stock honestly it would be meta right now don t get me wrong zuckerberg is running that company in the ground with meta however eventually he s going to take such a big financial hit he s open to dropping meta but he s already lost hundreds of billions you are probably saying here s the thing though he still has fuuuuuccccckkkkkkk yoooooouuuuuu money that s put your dick on the table and stare everyone straight in the eyes while you do it money the money he s left with at this point is still so high it s imaginary the one way that number becomes real is if keeps on with meta i don t know at what point in zuck s psychology he cracks but he will eventually when the money he has left becomes real at that point he ll drop meta and get back to facebook as beaten up as this stock is and even with the overall market down this much fb would be up insane percentages in a quarter or two following this news do i think we have more push to the downside before we get there yes of course but ultimately if i m right in my thinking that could be the drop that makes zuckerberg pivot his stance even if he still believes in meta the reality of the economy and situation would force his hand however at some point after the big dump off we re headed for meta is probably a good play in a 13 year span if it goes on longer than that you risk no one caring about fb by that point and have moved on to another platform

china s gdp may be 60 smaller than claimed tldr for my fellow apes a scientist started mapping multiple countries claimed economic growth numbers to the increase in city lights seen from satellites he found a high correlation between the two in democratic countries that had a free press and independent parties measuring the numbers he found a large discrepancy between the two in autocratic regimes that controlled the reporting agencies and the press shocker tested his theory against reasons why totalitarian countries might have fewer lights when experiencing massive economic growth hey they like working and living in the dark they re allergic to electricity they care more about the environment nothing seemed to stand up to scrutiny based on the growth in lights he estimates that china s growth was less than half what they claimed this means that china s gdp is likely less than half of the us rather than nearly equal the other side of the coin is that their total debt levels might be between 600700 of gdp rather than 300 paper has been peerreviewed and presented at multiple economic conferences i know it s pretty mindblowing to think china might actually lie about something like this given their honest and transparent dealings to date but you have to admit the science is pretty spiffy

dd the one time you should put hoes before bros good afternoon to all my fellow regards besides permabears x200b while many of you have been riding the glorious green candles of nvda i have been diving into the financial statements of the shittiest public coffee company there is $bros i will keep this relatively brief because i already put so much work into the pitch deck that i did for other purposes but i want you guys to come on this ride with me so here i am tldr short buy puts on bros because their financials and coffee r bad x200b short thesis bros is a strong short candidate for four main reasons 1 incredibly weak financials that will drive further pressure to dilute equity holders throw a monkey wrench in future growth plans 2 poor product market fit 3 inferior product 4 growth engine is slowing x200b business summary intro usbased casual beverage company operating 850 locations 60 company operated 40 franchised across 16 states and employing over 22 000 people founded in oregon the business went public in 2021 and hopes to one day have 4 000 locations dutch bros is coffee for people who don t like coffee x200b company history and growing footprint finished running a dq and looking for their next business dane and travis boersma started the company in 1992 as a doublehead espresso machine on a pushcart in grants pass oregon business has grown into over 850 locations across 16 states operating a 6040 split of company to franchised drive through coffee handcrafted beverage spots only franchise to employees with 3 years of tenure muted seasonality only flex 8 6 from baseline x200b real estate buildout and ownership all its shops warehouses hq buildings and certain equipment is leased re leases consist of both commercial ground leases land only and build to suit land building terms are usually for 15 years and usually have 23 renewal options for 5 years each x200b public financing and followon offerings bros went public in 2021 and completed a followon offering $26sh to raise $330m in september 2023 credit facility of $650m $350m revolver $100m term loan $200m delayed draw term loan interest rate risk is hedged via derivatives pay fixed receive float x200b analyst outlook and shorting pressure x200b x200b management overview founded by two brothers possibly dutch one of them died from als and the other is chairman and is stepping back soon they just got a new ceo on jan 1 and earlier this week they told the market that they are replacing 3 other members of the csuite this monthnext even if these new people are good it s gonna take some time for them to get established and that will drag on the stock same store sales growth x200b damn that s not a good graph this past quarter sbux was growing same store sales like 7 or 8 do insiders even want to own the stock as the old saying goes executives sell stock for any number of reasons they only buy for one and is anyone buying nope besides some piddly wink purchases of $150k by a new director and $25k by their general counsel the chart below from open insider shows everything that happened from ipo to late dec 23 x200b primary research i went to their store and bought like 5 different drinks they tasted pretty damn sugary and bad and no joke the double rainbro they sold me had a hair in the bottom shitty pic but you can see the squiggle x200b the fun part short thesis bad financials even though they are growing their footprint net income and operating margins have barely budged since ipo x200b things look even worse when compared to their main public competitor sbux bros ebitda margin is barely above sbux ni margin x200b i also run scans across a number of financial metrics and bros ranked in the bottom decile of public companies for free cash flow margin king of financial metrics high loan rates and short pressure downside risk and bad changes in net working capital funny enough it ranked in the top decile for media sentiment with idiots such as motley fool trying to shove this down retail s throat furthermore they can t afford to bootstrap their expansion capex so they will have to get the money from elsewhere read you the shareholder or debt x200b poor product market fit the menu is superrrrrrr sweet and has tons of weird names like the annihilator and double rainbro too bad lots of americans don t like drinks like that x200b also more people are becoming health conscious x200b and the rise of glp1 drugs could have a material effect wmt ceo john furner said in oct 23 interview that it is already noticing pullback in overall basket size for those taking glp1 drugs vs overall market barclays warned that same month of material impacts to junkfast food brands because of these drugs 70 of users visited fastfood restaurants less frequently inferior product i mean this is just me but their coffee tastes like dogshit steeped with balls sure this is an anecdote but go buy some yourself and try it out to reach your own conclusions check out this other review which i found to be pretty accurate like starbucks dutch bros coffee is an oregonbased chain that has expanded eastward however dutch bros hasn t grown quite as much as its cousin chain most dutch bros locations remain in the western part of the country depending on who you ask though having fewer locations of dutch bros isn t the worst thing in the world dutch bros is also similar to starbucks in terms of its supersweet beverage offerings you go to these places to order a latte with three or more ingredients in its name not for a quality cup of black coffee with indulgent items like annihilator a chocolate macadamia nut breve as well as a whole menu category dedicated to milkshakes the dutch bros menu makes dunkin look like an unassuming french cafe this chain certainly has the advantage of being less expensive than many of its competitors but all of this feels like a dance around the fact that the coffee itself is subpar one tripadvisor explained this writing i have been around the world a number of times and this was truly the worst cup of coffee i have ever had tasted like rusty water had to go to starbucks to get the taste out of my mouth dutch bros usually has lowgrade coffee which i only resort to in emergencies but this was truly the worst of the worst x200b slowing growth engine remember that same store sales growth graph from earlier here it is adjusted for inflation woof x200b how long do we have to wait for them to grow to their goal of 4 000 stores based on linear and polynomial regressions of growth history another 1020 years x200b because they aren t getting the sga leverage that sbux has my hypothesis is that there is an inflection point in store growth that they still have to hit the charts below are the margins for sbux and dunkin before they were taken private if you squint really hard it looks like sbux net income margin started taking off around the great recession 17k stores and dunkin had that around 2012 when it had 7k stores bros still have a long way to go x200b x200b look around 2012 they had 7k stores then x200b valuation x200b for the fun part i had chatgpt help me code a macro to run 10 000 simulations of bros s dcf to come up with my price target of between $561 and $791 check out this really fucking high wacc x200b brutal discount rate for those little dollars of fcf x200b my position i wanted to make use of my big boy margin so i shorted 200 shares of bros at $3085 last week and put the proceeds into amd i will probably leg in more as i watch maybe another 50200 shares i am thinking the q4 earnings for late feb could be spicy with this 184 beta stock i added in a small hedge of a $40 strike call because you never know x200b if you can t short can prob play this with pretty deep otm puts maybe $20 strike idk i m not playing that way so i will leave that up to you x200b in conclusion all bulls should go through a bear phase and experiment a little x200b x200b

nio stock looks very cheap year 2023 is a year where nio started increasing salesproduction nio stock looks chea nio is among the few electric vehicle stocks that could rise in 2023 despite the challenges nio nio 425 a stock that rode the electric vehicle ev hype in 2021 turned out to be among the biggest losers in 2022 it plunged 69 last year yet unlike most ev manufacturers nio continued to deliver throughout the year but its shares were caught in the stock market carnage as investors dumped growth stocks amid macroeconomic fears at current prices nio could be a rare opportunity to buy a growth stock in a fastgrowing industry here are the three biggest reasons why nio stock is a solid buy right now for 2023 1 one big threat to nio stock is behind it chinese stocks came under intense selling pressure last year on fears of getting delisted from the us stock exchanges if the foreign companies didn t provide the us regulators full access to audit reports the us securities and exchange commission even publicly named more than 100 chinese companies that faced the risk including nio the ev maker quickly listed its shares in hong kong and singapore as a hedge against potential delisting from the us collapse nyse nio niotoday s change425 $039current price$879ytd1w1m3m6m1y5ypricevs sp nio key data points market cap$15bday s range$871 $91752wk range$831 $2443volume48 894 342avg vol46 340 540gross margin1044dividend yieldna the good news is that there s finally been a breakthrough in the uschina standoff with us regulators recently stating that they were able to perform full and thorough inspections and investigations on chinese companies for the first time in history in other words the risk of delisting is averted and that s big news for chinese stocks like nio that brings us to the other big reason why nio stock has been under so much pressure in recent months the raging covid19 pandemic in china but as we ll see nio should be able to navigate this storm too 2 nio has a busy year ahead covid19 lockdowns forced key manufacturing regions in china to shut down multiple times in 2022 with nio also temporarily suspending operations at least twice in the year investors were afraid the ev maker would not grow nio s monthly deliveries did fluctuate in 2022 and the company even slashed its fourthquarter deliveries outlook sharply in december after china s easing of its zerocovid policy triggered a fresh wave of coronavirus cases yet nio eventually didn t just beat its revised q4 outlook but delivered a record number of vehicles in the quarter up 51 year over year nio s deliveries in 2022 rose 34 over 2021 which was again impressive given the persistent production and supply chain constraints equally important nio stuck with its growth plans in 2022 and started deliveries of three evs on its secondgeneration technology platform nt20 sedans et7 and et5 and suv es7 image source nio et5 in particular is proving to be a game changer thanks to its competitive pricing the premium midsize sedan s preorders beat nio s own expectations and the company delivered its first et5 on sept 30 2022 nio then rapidly ramped up production and sold 7 594 et5s in december versus 221 units in september in december et5 even landed a spot on the 10 bestselling premium sedans list in china in fact only two allelectric cars made it to the list and both belonged to nio et5 and et7 if nio could grow in a challenging year like 2022 it should be able to do so in 2023 as well even if covid continues to disrupt operations in china the company s plans for 2023 for now do look impressive nio expects to have five new models by mid2023 including a tesla model y rival as nio tries to play catchup with the ev leader to capture a bigger share of china s ev market meanwhile nio is expanding aggressively in europe where it s also extending its batteryasaservice baas program baas is a solid competitive advantage for nio as customers can buy nio evs cheaper without battery packs and subscribe to plans to swap and upgrade batteries at nio s swapping stations nio is also already building a massmarket ev that could be ready for deliveries by

why the fed can t solve inflation and will actually make it worse hello fellow retards lets jump right into it why the fed can t solve inflation the current theory on inflation goes something like this 1 money printer go brrr 2 more money but same stuff 3 stuff price go higher 4 money printer not go brrr anymore 5 stuff price not go higher note price never come down and most folks here think the fed doing step 4 will solve inflation but i beg to differ https x200b see the price rise is not actually due to demand rising the biggest components of inflation are energy and food and stimmys didn t actually cause people to start eating 20 hamburgers and drink gasoline everyday x200b https it s actually the supply x200b httpsyearbookenerdatanetcrudeoilworldproductionstatisticshtml global crude oil production fell by 75 in 2020 and is basically the same as 2012 yet the demand is up 10 in the same time period unless jpow can also print oil the only way to solve oil prices is to drill baby drill which goes opposite to the current administration s priorities why the fed will actually make inflation worse what happens when prices of any commodity goes up 1 company makes 10 units of commodity and sells for $30 each 2 price rises to $100 3 company gets greedy 4 company doubles output 5 extra supply enters market 6 prices go down back to $30 so step 4 by companies is actually what controls prices making it easy for companies to do this is perhaps the best way to solve inflation yet fed s actions will have the opposite effect oil exploration and production is actually a highrisk highreward business companies pump in millions of dollars in buying land and equipment to survey that land often they dont find meaningful quantityquality of oil there when they do they now have to invest hundreds of millions to even billions in creating the infrastructure to actually get that oil into the market rigs pipelines etc oil companies have to spend billions before a single drop of oil is produced x200b the most important raw material to produce oil is actually capital and fed raising rates makes it harder to get this is likely to create a feedback loop of more prices leading to higher rates leading to less investment in expanding supply leading to more prices leading to tldr buy long term leap puts probably march 2024

zendesk update sorry guys i didn t know that zendesk s pending deal was put on hold due to a cfius application today when zendesk announced approval of the deal from the cfius office the price shot up and the merger arbitrage disappeared i wasn t able to take advantage of it when zendesk announced on 10272022 that they would be suspending financial guidance for their 2022 fiscal year i had a good feeling that the transaction was going to clear before the deadline specified in the definitive agreement 12312022 originally when zendesk didn t immediately complete the transaction after the shareholder s meeting on 09182022 i had a suspicion that the private equity firm hellman and friedman might be waiting for the deal to expire before renegotiating the terms of the agreement the october 27 announcement should have resolved my suspicions but i continued to check delaware division of incorporation website for zendesk s merger certification filing not knowing that zendesk had voluntarily submitted a voluntary cifus application with regulators x200b if you guys are playing merger arbitrage its best to check with the respective country s regulators on their status of the deal for us regulators its best to check with doj first before asking the cfius office for status on the deal i found out however that if the company suspends financial guidance pending the completion of a deal it has secured clearance from the doj johnson johnson and abiomed s deal at 380 per share acquisition with expected closing at the end of q1 2023 might also be subject to cifus approval they have latest until q2 2023 to secure this approval or else johnson and johnson will back out of the deal microsoft and activision s deal at 95 per share acquisition with expected closing at 06232023 might also be subject to cfius approval in addition to cma approval approval from china s cfi office and clearance of the eu s depth 2 investigation of the deal the doj brazil s regulators and japan s regulators have cleared the deal intel and tower semiconductor s deal at 53 per share acquisition with expected closing at the end of q1 2023 may also be subject to cifus approval tower semiconductor is already suspending 2023 financial guidance standard general and tegna s deal at 24 per share acquisition with expected closing at the end of the year is subject to doj and cifus approval the doj already referred the case to the fcc so they will be making a decision before the cifus makes a decision tegna have latest until q1 2023 to secure approval radius global always gets random offers from suitors on fridays and mondays so that stock might also jump 1011 on monday due to takeover interest price fluctuations won t be significant enough for those trying to trade options on the stock polarityte also gets random offers from suitors on fridays and mondays too and its largest offer happened a week ago with a potential buyout at 125 per share x200b i know for sure that you can request this kind of information from the cfius office for free since its covered by the freedom of information access act of 2000 thank you for listening to my speech x200b update china s cfi office 10 minutes ago has extended the review period for the microsoft activision deal by 3 months after rejecting the simplified application from microsoft requesting expedited approval of the deal

will nvidia follow in infineon s footsteps what happened to nvda s european analog after the report drawing a parallel between infineon technologies and nvidia isn t entirely appropriate infineon primarily focuses on semiconductor solutions for the automotive sector industrial uses and energysaving technologies on the other hand nvidia is renowned for its gpus highperformance computing and contributions to artificial intelligence and deep learning still if infineon does venture into integrating artificial intelligence chips within its products the lines distinguishing them could fade currently their revenue and net profit are in the same ballpark and there was a time roughly 810 years ago when infineon had a slight edge yet examining their market capitalization paints a different picture one that sparks curiosity infineon released its earnings on august 3 and they were impressive for nvidia to match in terms of eps they d need to report over $48 the break in the orange line corresponds to the period when infineon had negative net income during covid

inflation explained for apes a little island full of monkeys all live off the bananas from a banana farm there are the banana baron monkeys who set up the banana farm who just chill eating bananas and being pampered all day the banana merchant monkeys who sell bananas and the banana consumer monkeys who pamper the ones who set up the farm at first 1 banana 1 banana this is nice and fair for all the banana merchants are passing a fair deal onto the banana consumers and the banana barons don t care what s going on however over time the banana consumer monkeys get pretty nice houses and stuff and they have extra bananas to save up and the more they save up the less desperate they are for more bananas the banana barons aren t getting pampered as much and the banana merchant doesn t get to see as many bananas he does this because he loves looking at bananas smelling them etc even if they re not his so the banana barons and the banana merchants come up with a plan they agree from now on 1 banana 2 bananas this sucks for the banana consumers but it benefits the banana merchants as a market taker now you have to pay 2 bananas for every 1 banana you need but as a market maker with connections to the monkeys that own the banana trees you can get 2 bananas from the central bank for every 1 banana you collect in payment suddenly the banana consumers don t feel so safe about their savings the banana merchants get to touch a million bananas a day and the banana barons are getting pampered again
costco is selling its hotdogs at a loss we can exploit this in 1985 costco introduced a deal at its food court for the price of just $150 you could get a quarter pound hotdog and soda now 37 years later the price still hasn t changed even as the cost of beef labor and other inputs has dramatically increased with the rampant inflation that we are experiencing today that same combo deal should cost $5 meaning that costco loses about tree fiddy per hotdog wallstreetbets is big and stronk we have over 12 million members if each wsb redditor goes out and buys 1000 hot dogs from costco we can lose costco 12 million $350 1000 42 billion dollars if we also short costco before their next earnings report we can 1 recover the cost of the hotdogs 2 make a profit and 3 get a lot of hotdogs tldr a plan for wsb to turn hotdogs into tendies while costco foots the bill might also solve world hunger too it can t go tits up

have we bottomed x200b this is a 5 year chart of the nasdaq in a previous post made on this sub we saw someone post what happens when the chart is below the 50 day ma usually a steep fall and that was looking at the max chart of the nasdaq however now looking at the 5 year chart we see the 200 ma and keep in mind i am new to the ta method but the last time the chart dipped below the 200 ma it signified the bottom are we experiencing the bottom now or is the collapse just getting started
snap down 26 in afterhours after slowest growth quarter i have been following and playing snap for the past year earnings periods tend to be extremely volatile with this stock but present significant potential if timed right i m expecting the stock to continue declining over the next day or two before bottoming out based on how the charts play out in previous earnings the last two quarters snap dropped significantly post earnings and rebounded from bottom about 20 each time i believe snap right now is undervalued and the current analyst average 1 year price consensus agrees at $14 or a 43 upside i currently hold no positions in snap but i m looking to get back in with shares and maybe options long dated options within 2 days for a hold time of 1 2 months i am open to any criticism and thoughts about this play x200b

allogene therapeutics allo potential as a reminder clinical stage biotech companies are highly speculative so there s considerable risk here i currently don t hold any shares or options but am considering taking a small position anyway as someone with an engineering background here are my thoughts not financial advice allogene is a leading clinical stage company developing the cart cancer treatment without going into too much detail this involves taking immune cells and gene editing them to bind to proteins on the surface of cancer cells to kill them currently these cells must come from the patient themself which requires individualized preparation that can take up to 6 weeks and cost over $400 000 for a single infusion despite the challenges the fda approved the first cart drug in 2017 validating the safety and efficacy of the technology allogene is investigating a scalable variation called allogenic cart therapy instead of using a patient s own cells they found a combination of gene edits that allow them to use any healthy donor s cells instead this creates an offtheshelf approach that significantly lowers cost while maintaining comparable efficacy essentially they re taking the wendy s approach to cart therapy not as personable as a local craft burger restaurant but far more scalable and affordable with strong phase 1 trial results released last month and phase 2 enrollment underway the company is positioned as a leader in a rapidly expanding market that is estimated to reach $10b by 2024 allogene has 3 active clinical trials with fast track designation including 1 for solid tumors despite promising prospects allo is currently the mostshorted stock on the nasdaq exchange with over 45 of shares sold short higher than carvana with their strong pipeline leadership in a rapidly growing field support from pfizer and sufficient cash runway to last well into 2025 allo does not seem to be facing any immediate financial headwinds the stock currently trades around $550 but the median price target is $15 and 14 out of 19 analysts give the stock a buy rating tldr allo may be overshorted given the strength of its pipeline and favorable clinical results to date

just one example why the stock market is completely irrational at the beginning of the year i bought a position in united microelectronics corporation $umc i liked its growth prospects with historical earnings growth of 19 a reasonable pe of 15 accelerating sales growth and a yield of 245 with its strong balance sheet altmanz 426 it seemed like a no brainer after calculating a present value of $727$2517 it seemed like a good opportunity to make money then 2022 happened currently the price of the stock sits at $611 way down from its initial price of $1170 at the beginning of the year even if one factors in the healthy dividend which was increased by 80 i am down 44 this however really makes no sense currently the company is reporting robust revenue growth based on yoy umc s revenue is 37 better than the same period in 2021 consequently it should be doing better but it is 2022 where nothing is rational as i see it now the company is worth somewhere between $888$2399 right now and has a current dividend yield of 469 i know it s just one example but this serves as anecdote that the 2022 stock market is completely irrational at least how this stock has performed is irrational and i believe there is an opportunity here

i needed some time to process everything and i m ready some banks may shut down and stock market may crash by fall i ll try to write this without the use of our usual degen language here and i ll refrain from using memes hope this helps some of you to take it more seriously this time depositors will have access to their money investors will lose their money that s how capitalism works in the last week this struck me more than anything banks have had insurance to a reasonable amount and now we re promising people and businesses that they ll get their money even over the insured limit as long as they are just deposits and not on some risky investment that s the message i get from washington s wording that should have cooled the markets down instead some people created the opposite narrative and it s getting dangerous for investors prone to fomo on top of that federal reserve is taking responsibility for the damage it s inflicted on banks by increasing rates too high too quickly despite the new bond buyback facility if you fail you re on your that s what i get from the actions taken and words spoken in the last few days therefore i don t expect a dovish fed next week federal reserve will increase their rates once again imo it will be another 25 bps the rate of which it will increase in the next few meeting will depend on the data as jerome powell says at almost every meeting since last year q3 there is no reason higher interest rates should cause any more problems because the fed will provide cash for mbss and government bonds so when they say it s not a bailout it s really not if they don t keep doing this forever the only thing that favours banks at this point is the lack of consequences for overextending right before interest rate hikes let s say they borrow for their mbs and bonds what are they supposed to do with it now while fdic watching them like a hawk i m pleasantly surprised that fdic is on top of things that they intervened the way they did when they had to so this brings me to my next point consequences with no bailout for investors during this administration investors in stocks should be extra careful where they put their money the drop in banking stocks is fully justified imo they will decline further if a bank fails you will have your securities as long their books aren t baked and you will have your cash eventually but the bank will be no more i suggest everyone takes a deep look at where their securities are where their cash is if you have gold or crypto do you really want to keep it in a bank or exchange that you cannot trust the next 6 moths is all about risk management because some banks didn t do theirs right and now we have reallife examples at nearly hundreds of billions of dollars of assets being risked because they overextended it s not a conspiracy theory this all happened we may see panic and even stock market closure for a day if when one of the larger banks go under at a time of depleting savings and working class slowly running out of cash this would create total chaos i can even see washington increasing the debt ceiling quickly when they need to supply cash to people and not banks this time i see that as a more likely and a better fix than bailing out a bank thanks for reading tldr the scenario i see has the fed increasing rates at 25bps until they can t and more banks going under in the next 6 months you as investors may lose money on bank stocks and it may take time having access to your other investments and cash what s guaranteed is only what s on your contract no bailouts do yourself a favour and asses your risks and manage carefully ps this doesn t mean you can t or won t make money by being long you can for a while until you can t disclaimer these are all my opinions and should not be your only source for making investment decisions of course reddit had to break as i was typing this sigh while i was waiting to post this wells fargo $wfc filed for $95 billion mixed shelf offering earlier in the year wells fargo once the no 1 player in mortgages is stepping back from the housing market but you know everything is fine this one comes to you from jim edit just added and deleted a couple of words near the end

even a permabull like tom lee is bearish first half of 2024 what he said is that we will push to 5000 and then retest 4300 in first half that is a crazy amount of drop we lose most of the gains we have had since november do you believe so what will be the catalyst for that kind of drop i kind of suspect that when everyone expect a pullback at a certain time point it could surprise us at a much later or earlier time

why market dumped today the answer is below snippet from jay s speech earlier today restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of belowtrend growth moreover there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain tldr bulls are fucked

tesla isn t a money furnace after all article barrons is the tom lee of publications that s not a compliment article tesla isn t a money furnace after all in the end tesla reported secondquarter adjusted earningspershare of $227 and generated $621 million in free cash flow shares jumped almost 10 after earnings were reported black projects tesla will generate $20 billion in 2023 and over $170 billion in the coming five years he is more optimistic than the street analysts project about $15 billion in free cash flow $102 billion over the coming five years black s 2023 projection wouldn t be unprecedented in the auto business but the fiveyear projection would likely represent a record toyota motor tm generated almost $27 billion around 2014 but the best fiveyear stretch amounted to about $105 billion in the middle of the aughts toyota of course is much larger than tesla measured by the number of units produced maybe a debtrating upgrade is in the offing still it might not be the catalyst investors expect because the ratings don t really impact tesla s cost of doing business the company doesn t have much debt

why do people believe in total returns strategy with total returns i mean investing in stocks that pay dividends i get the idea of it generating money each year but i find two big problems dividends are taxable as ordinary income not capital gains tax if a company pays dividends each year it means that is not using that money to reinvest and produce even more for the next periods companies that reinvest money then have a competitive advantage over these companies

inverted yield curve sqqq probably one of the most overlooked yet dependable signals for the market direction is the iyc it has predicted every major market crash and recession perfectly for the last 50 years it has been inverted for the last year which is longer than normal and it became more inverted than it has been in the last 50 years if history is any guide then the iyc is signalling that a major market crash will be upon us within the next 12 months the crash doesnt typically happen until the yield curve normalizes but if i was a trader i would be buying sqqq right now at $18share with the expectation that it would be a hold for 12 months
why rc selling is bullish and part of his master plan so it s very apparently rc ventures have sold all their shares and options in bbby over the 16th and 17th aug but we know rc has a plan and it doesn t involve pi55ing off his stake holders of gme as we know a good chunk of the shares and all the options were purchased less then six months ago late feb as per section 16b of the securities exchange act of 1934 more commonly known as the shortswing profit rule states a company insider as determined by the rule is any officer director or shareholder who owns more than 10 of the company s shares is required to return any profits made from the purchase and sale of company stock if both transactions occur within a sixmonth period therefore the vast majority of rc ventures profits will be handed to bbby which will be reinvested or used to clear debt source of shortswing profit rule clause

pivot already started jpow will have to explain why he printed money last week at the fomc meeting i m sure many of you know the fed s balance sheet increased by 300 billion last week at the same time we have a sharp drop in treasury yields this is a pretty good indication the fed bought bonds to support the market also to prevent the collapse of frc the fed basically had to round up all the big banks to get them to make a total of 30 billion in deposits i highly doubt they did it out of the goodness of their hearts with the biggest ceo on wall streets in the room they had to have made some sort of deal with jpow jpow undid 6 months of qt by printing the 300 billion and asking for the big boys help now hes in too deep if he keeps raising rates then more bailouts will be necessary and i doubt the big banks will step in a second time to save the day

11822 spy es futures apple and tesla daily market analysis today was a bit of a rollercoaster if you ask me but the one thing that we know for sure right now is that 1 378 support like i mentioned is hella strong and 2 384 is the next resistance level we have to take out x200b the last 4 daily candles are completely ugly with all these massive wicks and huge ranges and volatility but we reconfirmed 378 as support on that huge sell off intraday and i am looking for 388 to 390 tomorrow tomorrow is the day before cpi there is a very likely scenario where we trade between 378 and 384 all day in anticipation of cpi this would be much like october 31st if that happens however if we look at september cpi highlighted by the blue circle despite the difference in candle structure we are actually seeing a very similar set up we had a bounce off a key support level september was 390 and now is 3705 and that was followed by 4 green days for a total of 55 we are currently at 21 we could see a bigger push tomorrow to that 390 level which would get us about 54 rally over 4 days prior to cpi if you remember september the market was pretty bullish back then too and was under the anticipation that cpi would beat pretty bigly however it missed huge and back then much like now the market was not prepared for a huge miss on cpi when i look at the vix now and iv compared to the last few cpis the vix is extremely low and iv rank iv is very low for instance today iv was around 3032 which last cpi was 4050 the market is not hedged for a huge miss or a huge cpi dump i stand by if we get a big miss read my cpi trade plan posted under premarket analysis that we might get our biggest red open and we might see a repeat of september also support 3813 380 378 3763 resistance 384 3886 390 x200b i didn t talk about it under spy but futures much like spy did break that fomc resistance line today we are holding that 3805 as support nicely however hard rejected at 3865 i am looking for futes to retest 3865 tomorrow and push for next major resistance at 3925 a rejection at 3925 and spy 390 would actually form a really nice daily double top prior to a bad cpi reading and could be the top for a while support 3805 3750 3675 resistance 3865 3925 x200b apple once again managed to hold that 1383 support line and actually broke its steep red bear channel with that tomorrow we can look for some upside and that 145 gap fill is still on the table if we get a big enough green day for markets support 1394 1384 1371 135 resistance 1405 1422 145 x200b and then there was tesla once again another massively red sell off on tesla however this time it had a nice intraday recovery tesla is now down $3705 in 3 days and $5065 total over the last 6 days that is a pretty insane sell off on tesla x200b looking at the weekly i don t usually talk about the weekly chart intraweek but this one is important to show on that morning sell off tesla hit its weekly 200ema this is the first time tesla has touched the weekly 200ema since october 2019 even during the covid crash tesla never touched its 200ema on the weekly it did touch and bounce aggressively off its 100ema though if tesla is going to bounce this is the best chance it has in addition unless tesla opens under 1824 37 it will break its red dotted aggressive 3 day sell off resistance line and i believe attempt to go for its 197 gap fill tomorrow key support 1913 1866 1725 resistance 1942 197 2018 x200b the vix is at a very interesting crossroads here it is holding now in a consolidation pattern 244 to 258 and remains in its downward bear channel the june cpi which from these levels resulted in a 3 day spike of the vix for 321 was at 238 the day before cpi the june 10th cpi resulted in a 166 open and closed down 29 the july cpi was at 2579 two days before cpi and resulted in a smaller 113 spike over 3 today the july cpi opened down 152 but closed only down 052 the september cpi was at 2264 two days before cpi and resulted in a 3 day spike of 196 the september cpi opened down 22 the reddest cpi open and closed down 435 we could expect a 21 spike on the vix starting today through thursday eod this means thursday the vix should hit 293 but realistically could end up somewhere between 269 and 319 on thursday we also could be looking for about a 179 red open or somewhere between 15 to 22 thursday morning if cpi misses the thing to keep in mind at least for me is that this market much like september is not in any shape or form position for a big miss i also do not think if we do miss we see a repeat of october or july because back then we were at the 52week low and people were heavily hedged with puts but now that people are not positioned that way it will be much harder for us to rally intraday especially with the vix so low x200b i don t study the pc ratio as i feel its never helped and is just a data point but currently the pc is 234 and the iv is 413 which is relatively low iv wise compared to the last cpi where were near 50 the call volume actually greatly outweighs the put volume maybe someone can explain this better then me but the actual put oi is much higher then the call oi daily log x200b today was a pretty good day not going to lie not being greedy saved me about 4 different times from getting wrecked i luckily opened that tesla call at a lotto size and was able to average down and get out with a smaller loss but still not great interestingly enough data wise for me today i went 100 with spx scalps weeks win rate is 909 and my level to level plays intraday on spy were also 100 win rate with the weekly win rate being 857 for just spy level to levels however i am 0 for 2 this week on tesla l2l plays and last week i hit 715 win rate for the last two weeks for just tesla l2ls i am averaging 555 win rate for the last two weeks my pl $ on tesla l2ls alone is $389 and last week with my 715 win rate i had a pl$ of $1279 i had that 60 loss yesterday on tesla shoulda been cut at 30 that if it was not for that i would be profitable on my l2ls but i like to anlayze my trades to see if what im doing is working or not i will be keeping a close eye on this the rest of week and next week to see if there is a case to stop my tesla l2ls and stick to strictly spy youtube will be posted later

similarity and differences between the covid stock market bubble and the dotcom bubble this is a followup to my previous post about the 2001 dotcom bubble link for my model predicting sp 500 daily movement using 2001data the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted global stock markets causing significant volatility and sharp declines in 2020 the initial market reaction to the pandemic was a sharp selloff in late february and early march of 2020 as investors became increasingly concerned about the economic fallout from the virus in the following months markets recovered as central banks and governments worldwide took aggressive measures to support the global economy these measures combined with the hope for a vaccine and the eventual rollout of vaccines fueled a sharp rally in stocks this led to concerns that the market was experiencing a covid bubble as stocks soared to new heights despite the ongoing economic uncertainty and the potential for further disruption from the pandemic similarity and differences between the covid stock market bubble and the dotcom bubble x200b the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s was a similar phenomenon where the rapid growth of the internet led to a surge in stock prices for technology companies many of which had no actual profits or revenue speculative investment high valuations and an overall hype around new and emerging technologies characterized both bubbles however there are also some critical differences between the two bubbles the dotcom bubble was primarily driven by individual investors and day traders while a combination of retail and institutional investors has driven the covid bubble additionally the dotcom bubble was primarily focused on technology companies while the covid bubble has affected a more comprehensive range of industries and sectors the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 leading to a significant stock market crash while the impact of the covid bubble on the stock market is still unfolding x200b famous investor thoughts on similarity and difference ray dalio the founder of bridgewater associates has compared the 2001 dotcom bubble to the current market conditions created by the covid19 pandemic in a linkedin post he stated that both events were driven by technological disruptions that caused economic activity changes and created market imbalances however he also noted some differences between the two events regarding the dotcom bubble dalio pointed out that it was caused by the rise of the internet and the widespread belief that digital ones would replace traditional business models this led to an overvaluation of tech stocks and a bubble that eventually burst in contrast the current market conditions are being driven by the covid19 pandemic and the unprecedented actions central banks and governments took to support the economy the economic effects of the pandemic have caused imbalances in the market with tech stocks and other growth stocks outperforming value stocks dalio also highlighted the role of monetary policy in both events in the dotcom bubble the federal reserve raised interest rates to curb the bubble while in the current market the fed has taken a more accommodative approach by keeping interest rates low overall dalio believes that the current market conditions are similar to the dotcom bubble in terms of being driven by technological disruptions and imbalances in the market but with some key differences such as the role of monetary policy and the causes of the imbalances

the fed will almost certainly raise rates by 1 in next meeting i know this because on prior rate increases in the past canada has led the way in testing the markets to see how the market will handle it for example back in march 2 2022 the bank of canada raised rates by 050 before the us did when it was seen as crazy to do that large of a increase back then the us followed suit mere weeks later on may 4 2022 now recently canada has rates by a full 100 basis points 1 which seems unheard of a week ago the fed next meeting is july 27 2022 many think they will raise rates by 075 no they will not they will raise rates by 100 this month summary the fed will surprise markets and raise rates by 100 basis points 1 in 2 weeks as the central banks coordinated with canada to do first to test the waters with the market

short term bullish scaling into shorts 912 market analysis good morning unfortunately posting daily premarket sometimes becomes redundant since the bulk of the moves have been happening intraday but today is definitely a day to look at spy sitting above 406 support 410412 resistance overhead as we trade at 408 in the pm we re sort of trading in no mans land but we must remain bullish in the short term above 406 x200b it s also important to remain objective not emotionally responsive to this rally we ve seen because we must still keep in mind that september is a very bearish month x200b x200b therefore it is important to remain bullish in the short term but it makes sense to start scaling into shorts for a few months out we also have cpi and ppi data coming out this week trade light pile it on after we see proper direction good luck

$ura uranium is the strongest sector right now it s no secret the market has been weak ever since the fed spoke on friday with around 96 of the sp500 turning red many leading names have broken support and consolidation zones to the downside yet one thing we re seeing be loaded are uranium names and it makes perfect sense given the energy crisis we re seeing a lot of volume enter these names with ura looking to have its highest volume week for 12 months a very bullish sign the sector gapped down today by 34 yet once again immediate buying out the gate bought the names back to yesterdays close on elevated volume check todays price action the strength is obvious every time it tries to fade large buy orders step in $ccj appears to be the leader in this charge which is why i like $ura $ura has an aggressive weighting of ccj physical uranium and other leaders such as $uec which allows us to capture the move of the sector with less volatility x200b a list of funds buying $ura right now x200b a break of this weekly flag that s been building for over a year and things will really get moving the chart below shows the clear accumulation taking place as that large gap down is being soaked up x200b a break of $24 and we re pretty clear skies ahead x200b this is not financial advice

roblox dd bullish regrettably disclosure i own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6212024 stock is currently trading at 4398 usd at the time of posting for personal reasons i really wanted to see this company fail after having my roblox account hacked and losing all my items valued at $3k in pv but unfortunately they are growing and will continue to do so roblox isn t just a video game company they are also a virtual economy as well as a tech company fundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable creative and deep in content than any video game in history you can play cod dead by daylight just released by the studio behind fnaf roller coaster simulators elf video game based on the movie tycoon games and more literally any game you can think of you can play on this platform the ingenious way they make profit is similar to how steam does by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games clothing and most importantly limitedrelease collectibles that appreciate over time the main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency robux effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell robux at their own discretion this has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time eg the sparkle time fedora released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1 730 000 robux the equivalent of 2150 cad today as a result many players are buying and holding items some of which are sold in numbered amounts 11000 1350 etc holding their value even in the face of inflation eg released with 400 numbered units retailing for 17 499 robux or 220 cad versus 148 cad 180 days ago if you take a look at the charts over time their items tend to only go in one direction up which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials revenue hit $7132 million up 38 yearoveryear average daily active users daus were 702 million up 20 yearoveryear and hours engaged were 160 billion up 20 yearoveryear suffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the chain smokers lil naz x the weeknd disney dead by daylight and more they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product in terms of liquidity they have 21 billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres invest in more developers and partnerships and continue on the path towards profitability in the shortterm macroeconomic environment we have the holidays coming up and if you talk to a lot of parents kids are going crazy for roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game i predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40 if we follow the same pattern last year 28 usd on dec 30th to 3775 by jan 27th in the longterm roblox s technology is insane they have full software support for vr a giant user base and the ability for usersdevelopers to come in and build anything not to mention it is lucrative for them as well as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game with vr technology becoming cheaper year over year this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers businesses etc not a huge metaverse fan in general but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn t a bad idea in short i think roblox has a lot of room to grow with insane potential for growth over the next few years i m confident that even in the face of rising inflation which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive vr world

let me tell you folks how the depression of 23 hit and how we survived it all began in a monday morning march 13th like any other day but by the time the nyse opened we were all in for a rude awakening the markets started out strong sure but then things took a turn for the worse panic set in and before we knew it we were kneedeep in a stock market freefall the government tried to step in and do something but it was too little too late now let me tell you folks this was bad real bad companies started laying off workers left and right and before we knew it the unemployment rate was through the roof people who had been living paycheck to paycheck found themselves out of a job and up the creek without a paddle banks started failing left and right and people who had saved their entire lives found themselves broke as a joke homelessness was rampant and folks were living in tent cities all over the place but you know what folks we didn t give up we didn t lay down and die no sir we banded together we rallied around each other and we found ways to make do with what little we had we showed the world what the american spirit is all about and we came out on the other side stronger for it so let me tell you folks the great depression of 2023 might have been tough but we made it through we re still standing and we re still fighting and that my friends is what being an american is all about so fear not because we live in america

sri lanka pm says economy has collapsed unable to buy oil sri lanka s debtladen economy has collapsed after months of shortages of food fuel and electricity its prime minister told lawmakers wednesday in comments underscoring the country s dire situation as it seeks help from international lenders prime minister ranil wickremesinghe told parliament the south asian country is facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel gas electricity and food our economy has completely collapsed while sri lanka s crisis is considered its worst in recent memory wickremesinghe s assertion that the economy has collapsed did not cite any specific new developments it appeared intended to emphasize to his critics and opposition lawmakers that he has inherited a difficult task that can t be fixed quickly as the economy founders under the weight of heavy debts lost tourism revenue and other impacts from the pandemic as well as surging costs for commodities lawmakers of the country s two main opposition parties are boycotting parliament this week to protest against wickremesinghe who became prime minister just over a month ago and is also finance minister for not having delivered on his pledges to turn the economy around wickremesinghe said sri lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel even for cash due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation currently the ceylon petroleum corporation is $700 million in debt he told lawmakers as a result no country or organization in the world is willing to provide fuel to us they are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash he said wickremesinghe took office in may after days of violent protests over the country s economic crisis forced his predecessor to step down in his comments wednesday he blamed the previous government for failing to act in time to turn the situation around as sri lanka s foreign reserves dwindled the foreign currency crisis has crimped imports creating severe shortages of food fuel electricity and other essentials like medicines forcing people to stand in long lines to fulfill basic needs if steps had at least been taken to slow down the collapse of the economy at the beginning we would not be facing this difficult situation today but we lost out on this opportunity we are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom he said sri lanka has been muddling through mainly supported by $4 billion in credit lines from neighboring india but wickremesinghe said india would not be able to keep sri lanka afloat for too long it also has gotten pledges of $300 million$600 million from the world bank to buy medicine and other essential items sri lanka has already announced that it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year pending the outcome of negotiations with the international monetary fund on a rescue package it must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026 officials from international monetary fund are now visiting sri lanka to discuss a rescue package wickremesinghe said that a stafflevel agreement is likely to be reached by the end of july
highincome earners beware of paying higher taxes on your investment income if you have any kekw there is this really nasty thing called net investment income tax and it showed up under the obama administration here s how it works you are taxed on one of two options the irs takes the lesser of these amounts 1 you are taxed 38 of your net investment income this is investment income investment expense this includes the following gross income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents unless these items are from a noncategory 2 trade or business 2 you are taxed 38 of amounts exceeding your agi threshold if you re married and filed jointly mfj your adjusted gross income agi threshold amount is 250 000 if you are single your agi threshold amount is 200 000 example if you mfj and your agi is like 400k and your net investment income is like 200k then 1 38 150 000 2 38 200 000 you would take option 1 where only 150 000 out of the 200 000 net investment income is subject to a 38 taxation if all your investment income falls under shortterm capital gains well then sucks even more for you taxed at ordinary income rates and the additional tax this is going to be recorded in form 8960 right here this number then flows into schedule 2 of 1040 on line 12 right here and then the total amount of schedule 2 flows into line 23 of the main 1040 return

are tlt leaps so cheap they are worth it i wanted to first start off by saying tlt could drop much further and this is purely speculation option pricing but option premiums on leap calls for tlt seem unbelievably cheap this is due to their low iv as the this is the nature of a bond etf yet if you look at the 1yr 2yr or 3yr chart this looks like a stock with a much higher historical volatility then mm are giving it also for clarity my brokerage rh has itm calls for jul 2024 priced at $710 and jan 2025 priced at $960 this being because both options have iv below 17 case for tlt recovering of course we need to discuss what would cause the tlt price to recover the bond market would need to see short term treasury bond yields start to drop which would require one of two things to happen a recession or slowing inflation as this would cause drops in the fed rate yet long term both seem unavoidable let me discuss why i believe both are long term unavoidable the yield curve has been inverted for 15 months since july 2022 28 drop in tlt since then the longest the yield curve has been inverted since 1980 when it was inverted for roughly 22 months but the longer it stays inverted the more long term bonds lose value and the higher chance we see banks pension funds and insurance companies who own these get closer to bankruptcy aka silicon valley bank enough declare bankruptcy and we would enter a recession and force the fed to cut rates the other option is inflation slows and fed cuts rates and long term bonds start to recover another benefit of slowing inflation is that will also increase bond valuations at a whole across the bond market when to buy the thing is you obviously want to buy at the bottom which is impossible to determine i am fully aware people were making posts like this when it dropped from $160 $110 a share 1 year ago and look at the stock now but the lower it goes for longer the higher the chance of a reversal also the lower the price of every share the cheaper the option premium so at what price are leaps too good to pass on i am genuinely curious for the readers of this post when they feel tlt premiums on leaps are worth the risk but to me buying a slightly out of the money call for late next year for say $300$400 could be worth the risk

palantir market cap palantard math this is not how you should valuate stocks im sure i am wrong i haven t been right much i d like some actual good counter thoughts the math is likely all wrong from the 6$ bottom if palantir grows at an annual rate of 33 yoy you will get a 40 billion marketcap by 2025 dear bulls keep reading this retarded post doomers stop reading you didn t belive it at 6$ you will not at 20$ likely you will belive it at over 100$ 33 as the ceo promised delivered on and continue to outperform it would mean that at a bear market condition in 5 years the company would have a market cap of 40 billion this would be 33 from a 15 billion dollar company if all goes to shit you still likely will see a profit yes even at today s price the company cannot go bankrupt it has insignificant debt near zero and now over 2 billion in cash on the bull side because they have secured the 33 growth through contracts it is hard not to almost guarantee a roi in 5 years during a bull run pltr was trading at a 90 billion dollar valuation using the same metrics and multiples if on the 4th 5th or 6th year you catch a bull run with a 33 yoy growth the market cap would be 240 billion basically if nothing happens pltr will reach 40 billion market cap by 2025 if the market reverses institutions feel comfortable buying in and retards buy as they always do eventually the market cap should reach 240 billion by 2025 and if you somehow time this correctly you willmake 18x if i m even half right you will still be 8x if i seriously suck you ll still profit and if i am wrong then palantir is going to bankrupt typically software companies lose money at first its a sacrifice they make because if the product is sticky then the contract expand its almost impossible or difficult to come up with a new software or move it especially when no one has what is tailored to your organization exactly what palantir has done they have been private for over 20 years they had no obligation to return a profit now that it is public it is precisely on its way to being profitable company price to sales ratio to high i m not saying palantir will be like ibm but it is ridiculous to suggest that palantir sp ratio should not be be looked at through the same lenses as software companies multiples in fact palantir will not be like ibm because palantir is quiet different in its product and in its delivery theory values etc but it is a software company regardless of your feelings international business machines corporation has a trailingtwelvemonths pe of1448xcompared to the computer integrated systems industry s pe of 3535x price to earnings ratio or pe is price earnings the price to sales ratio for pltr stock is1203as of 7262022 the ttm average price to sales ratio for pltr stock is 2109 the current price to sales ratio for pltr is 4297 vs the ttm average in august you will have the government nhs contract that is considered a must win contract for palantir valued at over 360 million dollars uk will soon be fully palantarded needless to say the forward revenue expectations is clearly on an uptrend they are a sticky software and unique in its core of serving western allies russia and china escalations will only continue to add to palantirs thesis defenxd spending is going f to get ridiculous all over again when people complained they had too much government contract palantir had zero sales guys they sold all this without sales do you understand the few months of doing some sales palsntir massively increased its public sector contracts by over 50 growth yoy on the foundry side when palantir grew too much in its commercial side people worried on this government side no matter what people will worry today or 20 years from today i m not worried about what people think even the dilution rate cannot justify why palantir should be trading lower dilution at palantir occurs to continue getting the best talent in the world the shares that executives owned for over half a decade ago had had to get exercised sooner or later now that they are out the way dilution actually has dramatically been reduced you cannot convince me that they shouldn t dilute for talent i will continue to invest in companies that reward best talent in a highly complex field this is how you keep talent and continue to grow monopoly how do we know they are the best look at there consistent growth and impeccable financial statements zero in debt and outperforming growth expectations quarter over quarter they have learned to master the art of highly critical time sensitive data at the most stressful levels of government trust me they can handle any companies data no palantir is not a fit for allcompanies or all government but once it fits its never going out

nvda call flows 852m 351m in first 20 min sentiment has changed rapidly lots of hedging happening most notably with calls oi switching to sell side update 220 930pm i did some crayon drawings i know you like those essentially put buyingselling was mostly flat today call selling was in control from the open until early afternoon bottomed out around 230pm and then we saw call buying into close take this as bullish or bearish as you please i really have no idea what to expect tomorrow in addition here is the volatility skew on nvda for this friday s exp it is calls to the right puts to the left which is the opposite of what you may be used to i have never seen a volatility skew like this it s not a smirk it s a goddamn sneer it s like it s laughing at us and just betting us to buy more calls to say the volatility is heavily skewed to the call side would be an understatement some traders see this as the market is favoring an upside move some see it as a better chance of a reversal when the market gets too lopsided like this the iv crush on these calls will be massive poster again take it as you choose x200b
billionaire investor paul tudor jones who predicted the 1987 crash says short rates will stop going up and start going down before the stock market actually bottoms do you think the market has already bottomed out billionaire hedge fund manager paul tudor jones believes the us economy is either near or already in the middle of a recession i don t know whether it started now or it started two months ago jones told cnbc billionaire hedge fund manager paul tudor jones believes the us economy is either near or already in the middle of a recession as the federal reserve rushed to tamp down soaring inflation with aggressive rate hikes i don t know whether it started now or it started two months ago jones said monday on cnbc s squawk box when asked about recession risks we always find out and we are always surprised at when recession officially starts but i m assuming we are going to go into one the national bureau of economic research is the official arbiter of recessions and uses multiple factors in making its determination the nber defines recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months however the bureau s economists profess not even to use gross domestic product as a primary barometer read the full article

is jpow about to put the hurt on the market remember a month ago when there was all the talk about treasury yields at 5 doing the work of the fed hikes well that shit evaporated and it s down to 43 lately fed officials are sounding dovish as fuck but in the past its been jpow who slapped his footlong down on the table and yelled higher for longer bitches economic data is pointing toward soft landing inflation is ticking down but 10 year2 year disinversion has historically been turtle penis head time i m confused as fuck someone enlighten me
$mara chart forming an m today how we feeling on bitcoin miners going into 2024
why the fed will not hike 100bps lets use real biological science to predict the fed according to this drawing we can certainly say that jpow would never ever come close to a situation where we would get volckered it s just not in his dna volcker was a 6 7 250lbs cigar smoking pimp who brought down inflation and wall street to it s knees since the almighty paul v we haven t seen a 100bps rate hike not under greenspan bernanke or yellen why is it that i don t expect a 100bps rate hike because if you look closely at the drawing above you can see that greenspan and jpow are both 6 feet tall meaning that he will never surpass greenspan s hawkishness in 1994 so what is my prediction x200b x200b why would anyone complain about rising prices if everyone gets free money brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
this bailout means inflation is here to stay the recent fed announcement has inflationary implications that will cause an even bigger inflationary banking crisis banking institutions will now gain the ability to borrow from the fed at the face value of their bond holdings so if bank a made the dumb decision to buy treasuries when yields were 2 and now they are facing a 2530 haircut on their bond holdings they can now use these holdings as collateral while the fed lends to them at 100 so a $1 000 bond that is now marked to market at $700 can now be used as collateral to borrow $1 000 in cash why is this bad well now bank a can take $1 000 and buy a new bond at a 6 yield they can earn 6 interest whereas before they would only earn 2 banks with shit risk management to begin with are now able to increase their treasury holdings earn higher interest and have their deposits backstopped by the fed if need be tldr banks can now borrow free money from the fed invest in higher yielding treasuries than before and avoid any consequence inflation will continue to increase

rklb earnings today after market here s a dive into the dd want to actually get to the moon rocket lab rklb may be able to get you there it reports its quarterly earnings after market close today last quarter it beat expectations and showed that it is on the verge of profitability by declaring an eps loss of only 8 cents a share lab s space systems side of its business has been exploding and rocket lab built components are being used on everything from communications satellites to the new lunar gateway space station that nasa is building for its artemis moon program but aside from that there is a much bigger black swan event that is disrupting the singleuse rocket industry in the united states in a major way that rocket lab stands to gain from the inability of two of its major competitors united launch alliance and northrup grumman to build new rockets due to a shortage of 1st stage rocket engines due to the russoukrainian war here is a dive into the bull case for rocket lab electron blasting off into space what s driving rocket lab s earnings while rocket lab may be most well known for its electron rocket its earnings are actually more driven by its space systems business than its launch side of the business while rocket lab started out as primarily a launch company it has since acquired a number of small but industry vital private companies that provide key components to the space business the space systems business over the past couple years rocket lab has acquired sinclair interplanetary solaero and planetary systems corporation in pursuit of a vertical integration strategy to expand and solidify its business as a result rocket lab now makes such necessary components as its photon satellite bus payload integration systems solar panels fly wheels star trackers radios and software these key components are used on satellites from companies all over the world and fly on the rockets of virtually all other satellite companies rocket lab has been winning contract after contract to produce space systems components for nasa the us military and other key governmental organizations the result is a massive boom in revenue to rocket lab over what its launch services side of the business since rocket lab s new amalgamated space systems business allows it to compete more effectively for government and private contracts than the companies it acquired did before with the communications satellite industry continuing to boom and a sustained bipartisan interest in the federal government for furthering america s space policy there is sure to be even more space systems revenue on the horizon so if spacex is dominating the launch industry with reusable rockets why are old style single use rockets still profitable in the market while you may think that the low cost of spacex s reusable falcon9 launches would drive out the old single use launchers like northrup grumman and united launch alliance ula from the market a steady flow of government launch contracts continues to go to both companies government launch contracts and telecom launch contracts drive the rocket launch market and the government has a good reason to keep multiple rocket companies in business even if it means paying higher costs for single use launchers that could otherwise fly on cheaper spacex rockets this policy aims to spread the wealth around to ensure that multiple launch providers stay in business and that the government and the military will always have access to a launch provider in the event there was only one launch provider should that launch provider go out of business or its rocket be forced out of service from supply shortagesstrikestechnical defects ect the government would be stuck between a rock and a hard place with no launch service provider hence companies like orbital sciences and united launch alliance were able to continue to secure profitable government launch contracts long after spacex s falcon 9 and falcon heavy outpriced them in the market the military specifically buys launch contracts from multiple launch providers for this very reason so what s changed to disrupt the status quo with the single use rocket market both united launch alliance and northrup grumman had become reliant on russian rocket engines to power the first stages of their atlas and antares rockets these russian 1st stage rocket engines were cheaper and at one point more reliable than new build american rocket engines that were on the market the tensions between the united states and russia have now completely disrupted the launch market for united launch alliance and northrup grumman while us sanctions did not ban the import of russian rocket engines russia cut off their export to the usa result is that united launch alliance and northrup grumman can no longer make working rockets because they have no more engines so if ula and northrup grumman used to use russian engines what are they trying to do now to keep their launch services afloat the answer is that in the short term they can t united launch alliance had already attempted to switch to american made engines for the first stage on its new vulcan centaur rocket selecting the be4 engine built by jeff bezos s blue origin however the be4 engine was in development hell seeing delay after delay in its development with the first engines only being delivered to ula on october 31st they have yet to be actually used by ula and are not yet flight proven the result is that once the supply of russian 1st stage engines has been used up ula will no longer be able to launch atlas rockets unless it can get the be4 operational on its vulcan rocket likewise northrup grumman has scrambled to try and find an alternative source of 1st stage engines for its antares rocket it has signed a contract with firefly aerospace to supply 1st stage engines for the antares the problem firefly has yet to develop a flight proven engine for even its own rockets firefly s launch attempt in september of 2021 saw its alpha rocket blow up due to engine failure 15 seconds into the launch and its launch attempt in october of 2022 saw its satellites entered into an orbit too low that caused most of them to burn up into the atmosphere a week after the launch northrup grumman contract calls for firefly to develop a 1st stage engine considerably larger than that it developed for the alpha rocket while obtaining the northrup grumman contract is a huge win for firefly financially it does absolutely nothing for northrup grumman in terms of providing continuity of launch services via its antares rockets in the short term or even long term if firefly cannot develop a working engine northrup grumman can still handle a small number of us government launches via its minotaur series of rockets that use refurbished peacekeeper icbms but the use of these rockets is heavily restricted by the government x200b firefly s september 2021 launch mighty expensive fireworks so now that the good old boys ula and northrup grumman are effectively hamstrung in the rocket market who will gain rocket lab and spacex with the supply of launch services provided by ula and northrup grumman all but shut off due to the 1st stage engine crisis more and more launch contracts have been shifted to rocket lab and spacex who are securing more and more government launches the united states national reconnaissance office a spy agency just utilized a rocket lab electron to launch a spy satellite a few months ago northrup grumman unable to use its own engineless rockets was forced to sign a contract with spacex to launch three northrup grumman cygnus cargo spacecraft to the international space station on spacex falcon9 rockets with alternate new space companies like astra firefly and relativity space unable to bring working rockets to market the us government will have no choice but to order more and more launches from rocket lab and spacex this is great news for rocket lab who just announced that they now have increased production capacity to be able to launch to market demand rocket lab also just announced that it is going to try again on catching an electron first stage with a helicopter they primary key to getting to reusability on the electron should that succeed reusability of the electron will result in major cost savings and in increase in profit per launch even without reusability the us government s policy of selecting multiple launch providers for its contracts to keep a monopoly from forming will ensure that rocket lab keeps getting a steady stream of contracts that would otherwise go to spacex i am long rocket lab and have been for quite some time i have loads of shares november 18 calls january 20 calls and a few later expiry

when will the fed stop raising rates and what could infllation do i wonder when the fed will stop the rate hikes when inflation goes down or when the inflation is back at 2 percent so will at 3 percent the fed still raise rates also what actually causes the inflation to go down in your opinion higher interest rates mean less borowing and more interest on debt so people have less money to spent corporations have less profit and less new moiney enters the economy or is it a failing stock market and more bad news about the economy that make people more scared and makes them spent less money predictions about when inflation will go down and whether the fed will lower the interest rates are also welcome and or after that the stock market will rally again all with a realistic explanation of course thanks in advance
why the automotive market will lead the impending crash one of the most common loan types is an automotive loan currently the us consumers hold appx 15t in auto loans we have seen massive markup from stealerships on popular new car models many auto manufacturers offer their own finance this leaves the car manufacturers vulnerable to the loss due to default on loans and depreciation of assets repossessed as the interest rates continue to rise and the price of new vehicles also continues to rise a massive portion of the population will be priced out of not just new cars but good condition used cars modern cars especially electric vehicles have a limited usecycle between expensive electronics which rely on international production and shipping to batteries with limited use cycles the lifespan of the average new car will be reduced as supply chain constraints are hindered by the cost of transportation if we are looking at a longterm depressed market more akin to the 19651981 stagnation interest rates will remain arbitrarily high luxury goods will be severely hampered and corporate growth will not be able to meet the timecost associated with business loans or even federal reserve notes vehicles are often a necessity in the singular but multiple vehicles in a household will very likely be considered a luxury especially as fuel prices and foreignimported repair parts continue to consume a larger portion of the cpi buying jun23 puts on $f and $gm on monday

spirit jetblue vs doj money to be made 100 while not the most glamorous longterm investment the proposed merger between spirit airlines and jetblue airways presents an enticing opportunity the merger agreement stipulates a substantial payout of $3350 per share to spirit airlines shareholders representing a significant premium over the current trading price of around $15 per share this attractive premium offers a chance to capitalize solely on the merger s potential completion if the merger is approved astute investors who acquire spirit airlines stock now could potentially see a return of over 131 this bet s success hinges solely on the successful completion of the merger which is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny bullshit look it up and read transcript before you disagree if the merger falls through spirit airlines stock could experience a significant decline though likely 50 or more therefore the investment decision in spirit airlines boils down to a wellinformed assessment of the merger s likelihood of success for those investors willing to take on some calculated risk the potential upside from the mergerdriven payout could outweigh the limited downside don t say you didn t know i can see the tide turning but just this week and last i was being told i was a bot for suggesting this and now i am seeing full port yolo s good luck to us all casino let me know your thoughts if you read this far please

2823 spy es futures and tesla daily market analysis after what i would say was a reiteration of hawkishness from not only jpow yesterday but also from all the fed speakers intraday today we finally had a negative reaction market wise however there is still a case that this is going to continue to push higher leading into cpi we are now 4 days away from cpi and while officially yoy consensus has not hit the markets yet we are seeing preliminary numbers suggesting yet another cpi core yoy beat but a very probably rebound on cpi core mom the question will then remain do markets want to and care more about the yoy decline or do they care more about a significant rebound of mom if you remember we got our first negative mom reading since 2020 i believe it was and the markets still didn t rally which honestly when you look at what has happened since cpi its quite incredible that we didn t rally off that x200b today was your classic inside day pattern on spy and futures we didn t quite see that 4152 resistance retested and we didn t quite get all the way back down to key support at 4088 that i would have liked to seen tested so while we did close red today in all reality its hard to call this bearish yet we also managed to wick down to the daily 8ema and hold that support line with the break through of that bull channel support yesterday we have now restructured our bull channel and restructured the broken resistance line and find ourselves yet again in another break out break down triangle key support remains at 4109 that means spy has to open green and hold green all day and key resistance remains at 4152 we have not closed a candle below the daily 8ema since january 19th and we have only closed two candles below the daily 8ema since january 5th so almost 5 weeks of trading all supported by the daily 8ema still incredibly impressive strength here shown by spy from a bearish standpoint they want to see a close below 4088 tomorrow which puts us closed below the daily 8ema and would most likely result in a test of 4053 support if the bulls lose that support then we start talking about a bigger drop down to 400 support however if the bulls can turn this inside day into a bullish pattern and reclaim 4152 resistance and most importantly close over that resistance i would feel comfortable in a rally to 4195 leading into cpi key spy support 4106 4088 4066 4053 403 key spy resistance 4132 4152 4169 4195 x200b while its not nearly as clear on spy as it is here on futes we are actually seeing a potential bull flag here on the daily which would confirm that breakout rally to 4195 4200 now i mentioned yesterday that despite the daily 8ema support bounce double bottom we had to worry about that bigger double top off 4177 and that a retrace today was highly probable my key support to watch today was 4145 and 4123 with this now being the third day in a row to touch and bounce off the daily 8ema we should be looking for a bigger move either below or under that 8ema tomorrow we had a true inside day here on futes and we rejected both key resistance at 4177 and bounced off key support at 4123 we do not have a true sense of direction just yet tomorrow the bulls need a closure over 4177 and we are going to start looking at a rally to 4210 however the bears could secure a close below 4123 tomorrow which would open up a sell off into that 40854095 support area as frustrating as it is both scenarios are highly probable there is also a breakout triangle formed here on futures and it should be noted that futes never lost its original bull channel support which lies at 4105 for tomorrow and breakout resistance will be at 4175 so we will keep a close eye on those levels tomorrow key futures support 4123 4095 4085 4040 4030 key futures resistance 4145 4177 4210 x200b tesla with an impressive feat has now closed its 7th green day in a row it did have a notable 8 green days in a row back in march 2022 may 2013 and april 2020 it managed to put in a 10 day in a row green streak also the question remains how much does this rally have left i restructured our blue rising wedge support line after yesterdays support bounce and today we once again lost that support but managed to find intraday strength and closed green x200b im not saying a well placed tweet late last night about a master plan 3 for tesla for its march 1st investors day is to blame for todays strength but when spy closes 1 red and everyone but tesla closes red nvidia closed at 014 green something isn t quite right so the question remains how much meme could a meme meme if a meme could meme as much as a meme could meme if a meme could meme we are incredibly now closing in on the daily 200ema on tesla which sits at 2149 that would be another impressive 7 rally from todays close for tesla to get there but it is a very real possibility unless the flood gates finally open today spy showed true weakness for the first time in quite a long time and this time the rest of tech followed that weakness too tesla the last few days really the last week of trading besides last friday has come out very weak with a morning sell of and by some miracle continues to find strength to push this higher today the bulls finally closed over 1971 and broke through that 200 price target its pretty frustrating here because the logical choice here is 100 puts and i just keep waiting for that morning tesla opens 4 for no reason but this thing just wont stop going up but after a nearly 110 rally over 56 weeks i truly can not justify calls my thoughts remain if spy doesn t have a breakdown into cpi retesting 400405 and choses to rally that tesla is probably going to push for some sort of incredible blowoff top up in that 230250 range however if we see a market wide sell off leading into cpi tesla has the most to lose next to probably nvidia the issue now is when my other thoughts remain if cpi does miss next week on tuesday and we finally see the wind taken outta the bulls sails that tesla and all these other memes and tech stocks who have rallied mercilessly the last 7 weeks are going to have some incredible sell offs key tesla support 1961 1902 1839 key tesla resistance 2015 2048 2088 2149 x200b the last piece of the puzzle that makes me believe spy at least is going to see a more major sell off here over the next few days is the vix ow i mentioned yesterday that we broke that 4 month long resistance line however today we actually broke yesterdays hod for the vix and today we closed right at that key 196197 resistance line if the vix continues this trend up tomorrow and especially if it turns its daily 20ema into support we could be seeing a more significant pullback on spy something to note here is the fact that the vix closed over its daily 20ema for the first time since january 5th we have not had a full candle over the daily 8ema since then and have only closed 1 candle over 197 since january 23rd if the vix continues this rally up we are going to see a bigger retrace here on spy and my target will remain 390400 for any significant retrace we are once again finding ourselves at a crossroads here on spy we have the bearish pieces of the puzzle starting to form however for the last 7 weeks every time the bears attempted to make a move the bulls have absolutely crushed their hopes and dreams up until realistically fomc day we were rallying on technical talking about spy here and momentum but for the last week now we have been rallying on i don t even know what it sure feels like the algos buy button is stuck and they haven t figured out how to unstick it yet x200b next two days do have some decent data which is jobs tomorrow however something to keep in mind is that jpow despite saying he did not like how strong the labor force was did allude to him essentially not caring about jobs as much it will actually be telling tomorrow to see how the algos react to this data friday we have umich sentiment which i am pretty sure has resulted in a rally almost every single friday at 10am for the last 4 weeks daily log x200b today was one of those highly frustrating days where price action was so incredibly violent and all over the place that we just couldn t get good entries or exits win rate wise played today fairly well obviously but that one stop loss hunt only for spy to drop even further after i got hunted was highly frustrating the last week or two has become increasingly difficult to trade i am finding myself missing the obvious moves on one play as in today we hard rejected a key level i watch but by time i believed it the play was already up 10 and at that point its chasing fomo and on the next play i take the obvious entry that follows every single on of my rules and end up getting stop loss hunted before the move ever comes to pay me longer dte plays holds we are also at a highly frustrating time period here as we have cpi in 4 days so going long is extremely risky as we could easily see a massive dump on spy leading into cpi like the past or we could see a highly regarded rally into cpi like september the rally has lasted so long now with out any meaningful pullback or consolidation that for me at least to continue to believe in upside here is tough i do see an upside case for 420 to 430 depending on what cpi brings us but i also realize how far gone this rally on spy has gone and especially on other tickers like tesla nvidia that i just cant quite bring myself to fully bet against it anymore the market has put us in between a rock and a hard place we have three options here 1 we sit cash gang i like this option and play intraday trends and trade lightly until technical tighten back up 2 you go long on calls and believe in the strength of the bulls and bull market and hope that you aren t buying the literal top 3 you go long on puts believing that even in a true bull market stocks do not go up forever and you risk missing out on the next 510 move up in the markets honestly all three options have their downside even just trading intraday we are left with these extremely choppy and irrational days that make it nearly impossible to gain any true edge when the price of spy decides its going to pump $1 on a 15min candle only to immediately drop $15 then next candle and then rally back $125 the next candle its nearly impossible to lock into a trend and trade this well for me until something breaks the bulls back its light trading and preserving capital for the next big move
$sag working through industry rough patch the industry has definitely hit a rough patch especially with supply chain disruptions but $sag still has an exciting project at sail pond that long term could hit big even more so considering the current sp is at 028 with $7m in working capital and the successful funding period in the last 6 months this is a steal rn imo the past blueprint should give a road to success mc $1953m
admitting a mistake doesn t mean the stock will go up mark zuckerberg says he missed a huge shift in the social network meta ceo mark zuckerberg failed to anticipate a newer trend in social networking that contributed to the success of rival tiktok x200b in an interview published wednesday in analyst ben thompson s statechery newsletter the facebook founder said he sort of missed a newer way that people interact with discovered content via social networking services people are increasingly using their social networking feeds to discover compelling content as opposed to viewing the media shared by the friends that they follow he explained x200b although people still interact with content that their friends share in their feeds the overall social networking trend has by and large shifted to you use your feed to discover content you find things that are interesting you send them to your friends in messages and you interact there zuckerberg said x200b so in that world it is actually somewhat less important who produces the content that you re finding you just want the best content the facebook founder said facebook changed its corporate name to meta last year x200b analysts have attributed tiktok s rapid rise in popularity to its algorithm which can recommend compelling short videos to users based on their habits and viewing history tiktok s rise has posed a significant challenge to the company which is experiencing a decline in north american facebook users and a stock price that s lost more than 56 this year so far x200b zuckerberg referred to tiktok as a very effective competitor during the interview and acknowledged that the company was somewhat slow to this because it didn t fit my pattern of a social thing it felt more like a shorter version of youtube to me he said
a plan so there are these companies whose market cap is way lower than their net assets so if someone takes control of such a company by buying all the shares and then sell all the assetsand pay all the liabilities then for some cases returns can be massive no promises but maybe 200 returnsrandom number but really sometimes the net assets is 10x the market cap can this work

psa to everyone falling for the same psyops play who really cares if ryan cohen sold like really he bought his positions 4 months ago remember the shitshow yesterday with seenbc when he did so the price barely moved at all the dump started happening after hours exactly as yesterday and of course a slew of posts from msm and shills that were another coordinated move also look at the ahs movement of all of the meme stocks why would they move in tandem with the news that cohen sold all his shares and options unless they needed this one last attack before shit really starts to go bananas one last move to shake out as many of the apes out of the trees as they possibly can if anything i d say he exited to avoid any legal implications when this thing really starts to blow up just like burry did before the january sneeze remember use your heads for once and stop being in an abusive toxic relationship with the narrative otherwise they ll keep doing the same thing over and over x200b x200b this is it
suspicious of an analyst buy rating on risky bio pharma stock $veru tldr word count is only 250 but ok i think jefferies is pumping up bio pharma stocks to get rid of their inventory from doing offerings for these same stocks that are beaten down now still a good short opportunity x200b x200b this analyst for jefferies randomly rated this stock a buy with of $55 when the stock was trading at $8 this sent is flying but looking through his history this raises some red flags 1 the last time he did this with liquidia corp buy rating from $7 to $14 in march the stock goes from $4 to $6 x200b then in april we see an offering for around $5 much better than they would have got at $4 x200b jefferies wasn t involved in that offering but they were the sold managers of the previous offering x200b another deal with jefferies x200b yet another and another with all these deals jefferies was apart of they must have a shit ton of shares to offload thus the rating doubling before the next offering 2 so with viru we may see the same dumping of shares after doubling the shares prices if we look through their offerings again x200b huge increase x200b again their last offering was with jefferies 3 extremely suspicious that this rating also came after terrible earnings that tanked the stock every other analyst kept their price targets the same x200b and this analyst has a terrible track record with picking stocks so why would his rating double or not send this stock flying x200b his only two winners the suspected pump and dumps x200b positions starting with june 17th 2022 puts at a strike of $8 x200b
wayfair dd aggregation from discord and elsewhere monday position update cut losses at around 1245 but held onto 3k in 84 puts the case for a short squeeze is even stronger now in my opinion monday premarket update and additional dd links goldman sachs upgraded w and raised price target from $35 to $55 x200b disclaimer don t take anything i say here or in discord seriously as many of you may know the most successful investor in the wsb discord barcode has blocked me and he may have a point also not financial advice of course nor is any of this life advice post background this is more or less a summary of some of the dd being done on the discord server there are a lot of good takes comments and links that i didn t include i also didn t have time to add supporting links to each bullet for the keks a screenshot of a w support agent yelling at me after they repeated themselves which i suspect was the result of horrible ai chat tools x200b executive summary wayfair is losing hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter and has a book value of negative $2468 per share as of march 31 2023 at the same time sentiment and upcoming events could drive volatility either way throughout h2 2023 wsbers background research 1 2 3 4 5 intro wayfair w first came onto my radar during the 23 february 2023 post earnings crash which some people made bank on despite poor earnings the purported recovery in the retail space lowering inflation and on paper benefits of bed bath beyond bbby going bankrupt have caused w to significantly outperform the market since february w has their next earnings release scheduled for 3 august 2023 so it s high time to take a deeper dive into w without blabbing on forever here are bullets for a bull and a bear case bull case 1 retailers love to short squeeze shitty companies like this one 2 3223 2234 or 478 depending on your source and calculation method of float shorted as of 063023 1 2 3 3 most people already expect their earnings to be shit 4 w trying to capitalize on ai hype 5 upgrades 1 increased price target to $80 up from $60 2 in june jpmorgan added wayfair to its focus list 3 moffett nathanson upgraded w to market perform in june 6 revenue is roughly the same as market cap 7 w shared a business update where they stated that quartertodate gross revenue is strengthening and is now trending in the negative mid single digit percentage range yearoveryear i m not sure the exact measurement and i think there is some ambiguity here but for this analysis i m going to assume they are comparing q2 revenue this year to q2 revenue last year so revenue for q2 2023 can be estimated at 3119 billion 95 of q2 2022 revenue 8 in the same press release it mentions that w continues to take market share and execute tightly against our cost efficiency plan driving us to adjusted ebitda profitability in q2 assuming 3119 billion in revenue and at least a greater than 0 ebitda we can estimate other particulars in the next bullets with some estimations of course 9 given w cost cutting measures an operating expense of 1 billion for q2 2023 would make sense and gives the following estimatesguesses for q2 2023 1 net revenue 3119 billion this is higher than current estimates of 308b 2 cost of goods sold 21 billion this is just an educated guess based of previous margins 3 operating expense of 800 million again educated guess could be lower with cost cutting 10 w bought capped calls on its own stock which will reduce the dilution associated with their recent convertible note offering there is no additional antidilution benefit after the share price goes beyond $7328 11 with expected dilution from convertible notes and larger number of shares outstanding w may lose more money but the loss per share will be less and on paper look like an improvement 12 w was able to raise approximately $690 million in notes which were used to purchase previously issued debt with about $1 million for cash on hand this at least bought them additional time before debt payments before a bigger issue 13 the convertible notes issues can not be converted by the creditors until one of the following circumstances occurs which delays dilution 14 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on september 30 2023 and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of the company s class a common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 15 during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per $1 000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of the company s class a common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day 16 with respect to any notes called for redemption by the company at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date or 17 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 18 with respect to the item above this basically means that dilution from note holders can t happen immediately bear case 1 a book value of negative $2468 per share as of march 31 2023 this number is higher if you update it with the larger number of shares currently outstanding 1 significant decrease in active customers which may continue active customers totaled 217 million as of march 31 2023 a decrease of 146 year over year 2 triple technical top if you are into crayon drawing triple top copied from stock twits i m lazy 1 insiders sold more than $5 million in shares in early july in fact they sold these shares almost immediately after they became available for sale from finviz some earlier sales appear scheduled 1 the cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $871 million so there will be a $871 million dollar charge on q2 financials 2 w continues to dilute shareholders through excessive growth in stockbased compensation the company reported $513m in stockbased compensation in 2022 up substantially from $344m in 2021 that would not be a significant issue if the firm traded at a higher market capitalization than in 2021 however the current stockbased compensation level will dilute the company by around 1213 per year at its current market capitalization in my view that is a substantial figure particularly considering its lackluster business and stock performance this is proving to be true for 2023 when looking at the new compensation levels for executives 3 true number of shares taking into account recent sec filings is 174 000 000 so the true market cap of the company is 121 billion 4 as a marketplace that makes very little on each sale it seems the only way they can make any money is by charging sellers shipping and storage fees i ordered a 7 foot couch for $200 and they are shipping it via fedex i can t see how there is any margin in that 5 w is going hard into brick and mortar this could drain cash reserves and was talked about extensively as a risk in recent sec filings 1 in early june w said that it would be profitable in q2 on a adjusted ebitda basis however using q1 as a reference that isn t a high bar they would only need 14 million more in revenue or 14 million less in costs to be profitable on an adjusted ebitda basis 2 their customer service sucks live chat repeated itself and when pointed out they yelled chat was disconnected after this their english was awful they also didn t do a good job trying to actually sell any of their products to me although i bought a couch for dd one liners the straightforward play insider selling tells you all you need to know the company is going downhill and shareprice should follow the tinfoil hat play banks will try to prop this up above $5954 for at least 20 days in october so they can convert their 690 million in notes and dump all at once a short squeeze after earnings could ensure the price stays above $5954 until october if this happens the first condition in which the notes could be converted to share and then sold would be met and the banks could sell on the open market the notes will mature on november15 2028 unless earlier repurchased redeemed or converted prior to august15 2028 holders may convert all or a portion of their notes only under the following circumstances 1during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on september30 2023 and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of the company s classa common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day also worth noting is that w may not redeem the notes prior to may 20 2026 on or after may 20 2026 the company may redeem for cash all or part of the notes if the last reported sale price of the company s class a common stock equals or exceeds 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive including at least one of the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the company provides notice of redemption during any 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the company provides notice of the redemption the redemption price will be 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest if any keep in mind that 690 million in notes at a conversion rate of 4580 228 would result in 14 351 081 shares or nearly 18 of current float or 15 of future float available to be sold on the market the double tinfoil hat play insiders sold at $64 in hopes to limit the rally to reduce the chance of the banks being able to convert their notes my hunch w will announce a share offering on or near earnings date and raise much needed funds to survive fund brick and mortar expansion and pay down debt positions strike 65 84 puts strike 60 84 puts strike 59 84 puts strike 58 84 puts strike 45 84 puts strike 44 84 puts thinking about buying calls in the amount equal to about 10 of the puts to limit risk bought strike 72 weekly calls at 2 and sold them for 25 retail sales should be interesting tomorrow x200b please tell me everything i got wrong edited for

presenting a dcfbased analysis for why you should stop pretending that gme is a good buy on fundamentals i m sorry for you that you re gullible and have lost a huge chunk of your money in meme stocks you saw on reddit what kind of a dick are you to then try to push your bags off on new people i see posts like uceyd77 s gme is at a discount and i m like mf er you don t have the first clue what it means for a stock to be trading at a discount i ve been meaning to show my work on why gme is not likely to be a sensible buy at current share prices and i ve finally gotten around to doing so you can find that analysis here i m open to legitimate critiques the tldr is that when you talk about how gme is undervalued to incredible fundamentals what you really mean is that you believe that the net present value of the company s future cash flows is significantly greater than the current share price i show several hypothetical futures for the company and what reasonable values per share might look like for you to earn around a 7 compounding return on gme at the current share price you need the company to start generating $100mm s in annual earnings not revenue in the next few years and then you need it to grow by more than 25 each year there are many such hypothetical cases you could come up with but any case has to be around that magnitude of performance to justify the current share price and again that s for around 7 growth in the value of your investment generational wealth for generational wealth the earnings and growth have to be so large in comparison with the company s previous peak financial performance that it s simply very unlikely you need annual profits in the tens of billions in the next decade good luck anyway go see it for yourself i ve ran the numbers i ve shown how i selected the parameters i ve made what i feel to be all reasonable efforts to offer a straightforward range of valuations for this company using generous assumptions show me where i m wrong

the stock market should not bottom until $aapl is $60 apple makes up almost 6 of the sp 500 and despite the rough year for all you bag holders and virgin fund bogleheads$aapl is still trading at nosebleed levels sure all the meme stocks are crushed and down 90 but there hasn t been bull capitulation yet and when stocks like $aapl are barely getting a haircutthat doesn t mean apple is amazing because they re not it means the market has a lot lower to go rates are not going down in 2023 so you can kiss the secular bull market goodbye the risk free rate is increasing and whether or not we have a recession is irrelevant because inflation is still above the target of 2 a recession will be good for inflation but it won t necessitate rate cuts why do i hate apple they have 16 billion shares outstanding and it s still trading with a market cap of 2tthis is categorically absurd the only reason why $aapl has been trading higher is the same reason why $tsla is still insanely overvalueda lot of stupid people are buying and holding itjust because you can t justify apple s valuation here any more than the bulls could justify $spy at $480 in january 2022 i ll stop being a when apple falls back down to earth until then i d recommend tactical asset allocation and opportunistic gamblingbut bogleheads will get rekt again in 2023 tldr the market shouldn t bottom until $aapl gets cut in half from here

my dd advocating a long position of gemstone grade zircon commodity what zircon is a zirconium silicate mineral found in small quantities in many rocks it can be a variety of colours and some crystals are of gemstone quality zircon is sometimes confused with the metal zirconium the zirconium oxide called zirconia and cubic zirconia a synthetic gemstone with an appearance that is very similar to diamond blue zircon is found in many pieces of english estate jewellery produced in the 1880s because it was fashionable at the time however during the early 1900s zircon was sometimes used fraudulently as a substitute for diamond so often the gem is thought of as an imitation gemstone most natural gemquality zircons are yellow red or brown heating and irradiation can be used to produce colourless blue green and many other zircon colours blue is the most popular zircon gem colour zircon that is faceted for use in jewellery is mostly without inclusions but they can contain long parallel inclusions that create the cat seye effect when the stone is cut as a cabochon zircons are typically cut using the brilliant style but there is also the zircon cut which has eight extra facets around the lower part of the gem in the middle ages zircon was believed to have the power to do everything from banishing evil to inducing restful sleep as is the case of some other gemstones zircon was saddled with a name that is more clinical than romantic different names have been applied to the stone often about the color such as hyacinth and jacinth starlight was a turnofthecentury attempt by gemstone legend and tiffany co stone buyer george fredrick kunz to romanticize the stone s name while tiffany had great success in other efforts las with tanzanite zoisite starlight never caught on why zircon has double refraction closest competitor diamond has single refraction zircon is the oldest gemstone on earth diamond is geologically immature blue zircon is extremely rare diamond is abundant as common carbon the majority of blue zircon mines were recently closed by the cambodian government how other stones in the past that have been rediscovered have had their value rise rapidly in a relatively short period a good example is tanzanitewhen tanzanite was first discovered in the late 1960 s it was controlled by tiffany company who gave it its name and were the first true marketers of the gemstone prices were high as tiffany commanded a monopoly and supply out of the fledgling mines was low and sporadic in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s as tanzania adopted a capitalist economy production stabilized and rose leading to a drop in prices further compounded in 2001 when the stone was implicated as a funding source to al qaeda in the aftermath of the 911 tragedy large retailers like zales announced they were no longer going to sell tanzanite and others followed suit leading to a catastrophic decline in prices from 2002 to 2007 prices surged from lows of $200 per carat for medium to mediumfine goods they rose to the heady heights of $600 per carat china s recent foray into the market and growing demand for tanzanite in that country is a wild card that could affect the price trajectory in coming years link to tanzanite chart my personal opinion onlythere is only a tiny amount of blue zircon on the free market there is an even smaller amount coming into the market to replenish with that amount getting lesser by the week even if the resource is not well known the price could easily spike 10 or 100x possibly even 1000x purely through lack of supply and a minor increase in demand in the west people are aware of the diamond meme even just as much as conflict diamonds get out ahead of the rush don t subject your lady friend to common carbon get her something as old as earth itself zircon is the future of engagement rings common carbon or love as old as earth in china zircon is known as thai diamonds not thai not diamonds the government there is attempting to move their population away from western diamonds towards zircon in part to help their very close ally cambodia as an apology for shutting down their major source of foreign reserves in sihanoukville i have been buying up enough over the previous months to already make a noticeable impact on price and supply i suspect that even if a few more join in on the buying the supply will disappear the media will pick up on it potentially making zircons the rarest gemstones on the market further information note i also like the fact that a blue gemstone is already a defacto symbol of our groupi am no longer diamond hands i am zircon hands appendix a what i consider to be a realistic market prices when taking the above into consideration appendix b current average market prices appendix c more info on george kunz who attempted the same trading strategy more than 100 years ago using the power of memes i hope we can continue what george started for george

make tendies out of the energy crisis with long term profitability $enph tldr russia invasion has spiked energy prices and global dependency of russian gas oil is going down due to a spike in energy prices solar power is a no brainer for ooftops providing better gains for the consumer than the index 810 annual roi in savings easily even in nordics this has already resulted in a massive organic demand and shortage for inverters and solar panels imho this is not yet priced in $enph has a growing stake in eu and us with a killer product and growth trajectory this post consists of the follow parts 1 background 2 why now 3 my background dd 4 the play i ve chosen $enph 1 background as many of you are aware russia invaded ukraine as a result and even before that energy prices for retail and businesses are going up for kwh that we consume this has resulted in energy prices already going triple per kwh than what it was just 36 months ago in europe europe wants to get rid of hard dependency for russian energy quick and nuclear power takes too long to build even the italian prime minister said you can have air conditioning or peace of course oil prices go up but that s a shortterm play by my standards and no energy prices will not drop soon even before the recent spike energy prices have gone up by 2 annually on average with expectations of far higher increases solar will not cover 100 of our energy needs the sun doesn t shine all the time and batteries that cover whole nights for whole cities are unrealistic but a rooftop solar installation can easily cover 2070 of a households all energy needsexpenses 20 points with a battery that can mean 1000$3000$ annual savings with a system that has a lifespan of 3050 years 2 why now just 6 months ago installing a solar system in nordics would have had roughly a 34 annual roi now it s 810 annual roi and now the whole europe is running out of inverters and panels especially inverters due to increased organic demand not only that but with the ambitious climate goals renewable energy will stay pretty much untaxed for the next 10 years in eu it s ridiculously easy to apply for a businesses to apply for 20 grant for installing solar power b farms to get up to 40 grant for installing solar c consumer homes get 1015 taxback from installation even apartment complexes with multiple apartments can now fairly distribute the savings due to recent legistlation changes and think about the move towards ev s solar power complements it very well with increased energy demand when charging your vehicle at home or other locations 3 my background dd i m an entrepreneur and a mathematician i ve calculated the roi 810 annual for consumer homeowners taking into account just about every variable including where the roof faces angle of roof geographic location cost of buying and price of selling electricity taxes most profitable solar system for any home etc i found out that just during the last few weeks the whole europe is running short of inverters and solar panels yes semiconductors is one reason for this but even more so a huge organic demand that has appeared due to increased electricity kwh price to be more specific a solar system will work for about 1020 of homes by my estimates though it varies from region to region a huge market but not for all homes the exceptions happen due to rooftop renovations that are coming up big trees making shadows on panels for majority of the day rooftops facing mostly north westsoutheast are all fine contrary to popular beliefs i will say that i don t know the us market as well though i know electricity prices are jumping up there too and based on what i see solar would be very much viable there too right now even if it doesn t provide as much roi in some states as europe does if a consumer buys a solar system for their rooftop they basically have a factory manufacturer guarantee that it will produce good amount of electricity for 25 years covering your initial investment multiple times over up to 5 times for my home taking everything to account from component degradation to electricity price increases 4 the play i ve chosen $enph solar is a huge market opportunity and it s no doubt it will grow on all of it s sectors in the coming years you could choose a solar etf like $tan or $rays or something thats not strictly solar like generac but i decided to stick to what i believe i understand primarily rooftop solar systems with strong consumer markets as i believe there to be a massive growing demand with a killer product i don t want to rely on our politicians to somehow gather the money for big solar power plants i trust that the markets function and in this case the markets will function in the sense that consumers will get considerable savings if they can put aside 515k$ or get a renovation loan for it nobody cared about the climate when the stock market was in an alltime bull run and solar panels only provided a measly 3 roi annually but now everyone is afraid to put money in the market and this provides a guaranteed savings on a growing electricity bill that are better than spy sign me up right now panels are always needed but based on what i can see anyone can still get solar panels of some kind but they can t find inverters solar panels are running out too though many european inverter manufacturers are family or private equity owned and not public however enph has a growing stake in the european market and it s growing fast for a good reason the microinverter is amazing and it s even affordable and the intelligent purchase from consumer point of view it even has 34 times the warranty that other manufacturers offer their inverters the one weak point in a solar system experts estimate that you d have to replace your inverter every 1015 years not so with this honestly i believe that this product wholeheartedly it kicks ass when compared to what the competitors offer the financials record quarterly revenue of $441 million gaap gross margin of 401 $12b in cash beat analyst estimates already 4 quarters in a row 78 5 revenue growth from 2020 to 2021 is actually profitable and growing at a great pace is tripling down in europe aka to me capturing the opportunity x200b my positions $12000 of $enph $168 may go in with more later i m ready to stay in this play for a long time the next earnings report will be out in july i may look into options closer to earnings date as i believe that booming sales season together with organic demand with a killer product will do well in the next months especially with solar you will get the most organic demand when the sun shines this is somewhat priced in though
spy i know the market doesn t make sense sometimes but i don t get how interest rate are high and we are seeing spy looking to to test 420 plus when just last year we had very low interest rate and free money just being pumped spy was around 450 yes the feds are going to slow the pace of hiking interest rates but to me if they say like we are going to start lowering interest rates then to me it makes sense for a market rally i guess i was a little slow on buying calls when the market went bullish after feds meeting but i felt like there was going to be dump coming soon i was over thinking so much i didn t make any moves and just sat on the sideline just cucking it you guys feel like spy will keep rallying or does spy plateau around 420

topix highest close since august 1990 the topix at an almost 33year high is a nice way of saying that anyone who bought the topix in august 1990 has been underwater for the last 393 months but is now breaking even the japanese stock market climbed again on wednesday with the topix marking its highest close since august 1990 the economy expanded for the first time in three quarters meaning that japan s recession is over the economy contracted by 1 and 01 in the third and fourth quarters of last year but grew by 16 in the first quarter of 2023 thrashing the 07 increase expected by tokyo s finest growth was driven by the return of overseas tourists and the same postpandemic household consumer durable goods demand that was seen elsewhere last year since japan was the last of the major developed economies to reopen manufacturing and exports remained sluggish though reflecting the current western preference for services over goods but possibly showing signs of a slowdown in the us and europe content taken from today s moneyfitt morning x200b a 33year high is awesome and all top chart but japan s benchmark stock index in blue has badly lagged the us s in orange
on why evs and robotaxis are not going to create multitrillion dollar companies the ev hype is finally plateauing this is my articulation of what i expect to happen in this space the manufacturing techniques of tesla are starting to be more widely adopted there are lots of other ev companies out there many are going to fail in the next two or three years the ones that survive will be mass market evs will be plentiful in the next decade maybe evs become 90 of all new vehicles sold margins will erode the market will look at lot like it does now with a dozen companies that make the majority of vehicles on the road the names might be different ones but the character of the market is going to be largely the same but what about robotaxies and fully automated driving that s going to lead to massive profits right probably not an illustrative example relevant to vehicles in 2000 i bought an s500 the nav system was a $6 000 option and the discs containing road data yes the data was on cds that you put in a box in the trunk were $250 a piece you needed 4 or 5 to cover the us by 2020 you would buy that same functionality for $200 a phone and $30mo for data and it gives you up to the minute traffic information to boot in roughly 20 years the cost dropped by a factor of roughly 30 tesla is getting $15 000 for fsd their window during which to charge this isn t going to be horribly long due to the everincreasing pace of technology advancement that 30 factor that took 20 years before is likely to take 15 years now maybe not even maybe 10 in 2033 i think you have fully automated driving for $300 additional cost getting a car without the relevant hardware and software will actually be kinda difficult and $30mo for data and that data will be necessary for a lot of reasons up to date road information software updates etc but also because your car is going to be talking to every other car in it s vicinity constantly feeding each other sensor data further this technological advancement is likely to make the overall market for vehicles shrink not grow because who the hell wants to own a car if there s one on the corner that will pick you up 30 seconds after you request it gradually people s garages will be emptied of cars and put to better use like for beer making equipment and you ll be subscribed to a new fangled livery service that you ll pay $xmo to be a member of and maybe $ymile the charges let the livery service company go out and acquire vehicles and maintain them they ll be very spartan because no one wants to be cleaning barf off upholstery all the time because these get used to get back from the bar but you won t care because cars are a massive hassle and the few times a year you need one to go to the mountains or take a road trip to matamoros you ll just rent one anyways my thoughts if you re looking for a multitrillion opportunity it s going to have to be much more than evs and robotaxis and insurance and batteries and especially fully automated driving someone needs to sit cathy woods down and explain to her how software technology inexorably becomes very close to free what doesn t are things like health care education etc
daytrading 430k x200b so i ve been daytrading since around june of last year as you can see from my alltime chart it was a rough journey i started in 2017 and found wallstreet bets i was originally trading jnug and shit like that which was pretty popular on the sub back in the day i evolved my strategy to basically buy calls on big tech and yeahit worked out i actually cashed out on a downswing because merril lynch gave you access to a higher quality trading platform and information if your account size was over 75k or something like that so at the end of the day on that original push i ended up making enough to buy my house for cash around 180k think it was facebook calls after that i thought of myself as hot shit and every year around my birthday i would use the distribution from my family s company as fuel for a robinhood degen spree ended up blowing up like 4 accounts maybe 6070k total pretty gross stuff but then around 2020 dec i inherited a fat chunk of money because we sold our family business was like 34m after taxes i put a few mil into robinhood and just let it ride if you check the charts that was literally right before the covid fuckery i invested at the absolute peak of the market kinda poor timing with regards to inheriting money and trying to be responsible but no complaints obviously free money is free after that i tolerated the pain and was just watching the market around my birthday again in june after getting my asshole reamed for like 6 months i said fuck it i can do better than just letting this shit do what it wants to do i started trading originally it was mostly theta gang as you can see that was relatively successful that ended when the market climbed over 400 i started daytrading probably by febmarch of 2023 anyway i ve had about two yolos where i was 7 figures invested in options a few months out that first fuckery i ended up profiting about 85k which was insane the stress was unreal and i was down a lot at one point in time the second yolo was more recently the charts don t do it justice but i was down about 200k at one point in time as well ended up selling that second one for a 20k loss after that second yolo you can see i became more disciplined again its like a 40 degree angle straight up with very little deviation it was a kick in the asswakeup call for sure anywaymy strategy is based both on ta resistancessupport and being somewhat cautious when getting into a position i generally will only buy like 20 of what i m willing to risk at any given time and if it moves against me i will average into the position i will sell for about 10 a contract i just daytrade the times when i m holding overnight are usually because mistakes were made and i misjudged a resistancesupport but had enough conviction not to cut my losses usually i will buy another 20 when my original position is down like 10 and continue to average down as it moves in a meaningful direction against my position sometimes i will sell for a breakeven or a bit more than 10 profit honestly a lot of what i do is based on ta that is informed by gut feelings i ve literally spent thousands of hours watching the market over the last 67 years even when not trading it i couldn t accurately explain why i do what i do and its probably impossible to replicate but overall i d say there are a few overarching rules that will make you more money in the long run x200b one don t go balls deep into a position regardless of how convinced you are of it decide what you re willing to risk and only go like 20 max at first to leave yourself room to average down if it moves against you this will make it so if even you re wrong about the exact pricing if you re correct about the general movement of the stock you can still make profit two be patient if you ve identified what a good entry point for your position is then stick to that stick to your guns theres been plenty of times where i missed an entry because it didn t quite hit my price target you just shrug it off and move on with your life there will be more opportunities later in the day or opportunities in other stocks so don t beat yourself up over it three take profits just do it before you enter a trade you should have an entry point and an exit point identified and if you sell at your exit point for profit then good job just take profits four don t have any regrets analyze your decision making process and if it was based on rationality as opposed to emotion then don t regret your choices every trade is a new thing even if you end up buying back in at a lower price than you sold your previous position at if its based on rational choices then don t regret it take your profits as they come five self analysis dig into why you made the choices that you made if its emotionally based then learn to recognize those emotions and what causes them and counterbalance that shit otherwiseyeahalways analyze your trades x200b tldr yeah you re a bitch

sales up oil down who s got the upper hand on inflation reports keep coming out on high sale numbers even higher than 2021 this will certainly impact inflation on the other and oilgas has been bleeding throughout november now the question remains where inflation is going with these two opposite forces one argument put out there they will cancel out probably inflation numbers will emerge rather lean and may come down a bit more but not as much as markets would hope for perhaps the good bad news is the number of new created jobs has been slowing down with rising unemployment this could encourage the fed to hold their horse a little bit till the dust settles looking forward to hearing further updatesdiscussions
nobody to blame but myself when you have lost half of your bag because you turn investing into gambling you put yourself in a position where you have to handle the rest of your money a lot differently than an investor maybe normally would for instance i spent $3000 buying puts on spy at market open by the time spy fell to $38670 i was up $1 200 i wanted to ride it out towards the end of the day because i knew this was going to keep tailingoff and it was a good investment decision to ride it out through the end of the day but because i made stupid moves chasing calls on a company like bbby i couldn t afford to pass up a $1 200 profit i went ahead and sold if i d waited another two hours that $1200 probably would ve been $3000 so when you turn from investing to gambling not only does it have an affect on the money you are gambling but it could end up affecting you financially months down the road because you can no longer afford to pass up crumbs when starvingcrumbs look good

fed is still buying billions worth of mortgage backed securities every single week when will this end source if inflation was such a concern and markets are so healthy why are they still doing this keeps housing values propped up at the expense of those who currently don t own real estate i don t know about you but it definitely bothers me average joe doesn t understand this and how could heshe they are too busy working their butts off to afford essentials which are skyrocketing in price fed balance sheet is barely off of its all time highs despite over 1 year of extreme taper talk not pretending that i have all of the answers but what a mess
easy short for a possible 500 gain by next month update august 23rd i sold all my positions today but the thesis hasn t changed i made this post when $dwac was at $17 that there s a good chance the vote will fail and the riskreward then was way too good to pass up the shares are now at $1390 and i sold my positions because the riskreward isn t worth it anymore in my opinion you will now either make 100 on options if the vote fails or lose 100 if it passes gains x200b to anyone still in the position as of today aug 23rd they still don t have enough votes the ceo was going crazy over the weekend trying to tell everyone on truth social to go vote and even today he s getting super desperate here s the post today x200b based on this post it s 100 certain if the vote was held today it would fail they have less than 2 weeks left to get enough votes and labor day weekend is within these next few days i honestly don t see it happening why did i sell because i made enough money with it and there s still a small chance it passes i don t gamble like that my next move will be listening to the live meeting and making a play based on the outcome good luck everyone original post $dwac has been trying to merge with trump s company truth social for the past 2 years the problem is the sec has been investigating them making it impossible for them to merge the sec finally resolved the lawsuit so the stock jumped from $12 to $17 where it is now on that headline so what s the problem they haven t filed their s4 yet and don t plan to in october however the spac will expire and liquidate on september 8th meaning as of right now on september 8th the spac will automatically go to $1040 the only way it can be saved by the maga people is if they vote to extend the spac for a year the problem with the vote is they need over 65 shareholder approval to pass the vote to save the spac there was supposed to be a meeting today to tally the vote total but the vote failed and they extended the meeting to september 5th if the vote doesn t pass by the next meeting it s over for them it s super hard to get 65 shareholder approval especially when 90 of the people who own the stock are retail investors who don t even know they own it last year it took them over 4 months to pass this vote but this year they hardly have any time positions right now $15 puts expiring september 15th are trading for $100 meaning they will be worth $500 when the spac liquidates it is also an easy short now until the next meeting on september 5th x200b x200b

last question regarding call option sell vs exercise i have a call option for 80c for $117 with total of $117 invested for 1 contract and my break even is if stock is $8117 and up if stock go up to 200 lets say thats $11 883 profit plus a 100 shares if i were to exercise correct i would get 100 shares plus $11 883 what would my profit be if i were to just sell my contract im assuming its about 10 of the $11 883 so around $1 188 edit so just learned exercising contract buying the shares includes the profit since im buying it for cheaper than the cost of 200 so selling would be the profit for exercise options thank you all the selling option contract for profit should be similar to the profit of selling the shares from what i get but it fluctuates so nothing definitive til we see it ourselves in that moment
fed never knows when to say when i m not going to pretend to know economics but i do know the fed has a tendency to over react they should have left well enough alone during the pandemic you can t use fiscal policy to combat a unique situation that wasn t exactly economic in nature there were stimulus payments and inflated unemployment payments to get us through slashing the target rate to 0 was short sighted now they are going to overdo it again and by the end of the year we will be sitting at 5 why they didn t have the foresight to see this coming last year is beyond me i did historically it would seem to me at least 225250 strikes a pretty good balance between interest rates unemployment and inflation sometimes you just have to give it enough time to work

how an ukrainian oligarch betrays minority shareholders of kernel holding and destroys ukraine s image for foreign investors tldr ukrainian oligarch andriy verevskyi chairman and majority shareholder of kernel betrays minority shareholders and damages ukraine s reputation among foreign investors he used shady tactics to gain control of the company including diluting minority shares and forcing them to sell at a low price but some investors are taking legal action against verevskyi and pressure is mounting on the ukrainian government to address the situation he still does not have the needed 95 of voting shares to do a squeezeout because some investors resist to sell maybe they see a huge opportunity in kernel or just don t want to sell at such a paltry price ukrainian shareholders can t even sell their shares since the ukrainian stock market is frozen a few months ago there was a discussion in this sub regarding ukrainian agriculture stocks such as kernel holding after the beginning of the war the price dropped by over 60 since a few months the oligarch chairman of the board and majority shareholder andriy verevskyi tries to gain full control of the company at the cost of the minority shareholders and ukraine s image to achieve that he played a wellknown game with minority shareholders he diluted their share and actually forced them to sell their shares to him at a paltry price after announcing to delist kernel from the warsaw stock exchange and planning a squeezeout first verevskyi s company namsen limited offered all minority shareholders to buy out their shares at a price of only pln 185 with a capital of pln 100 per share at the same time the media reported that kernel would buy out all the shares from the minority shareholders next kernel announced its intention to withdraw from the wse this prompted people to sell shares for the very promised 185 zloty fearing to be left without money at all in addition large funds including pension funds are not allowed to own shares in companies that are not on the stock exchanges with that strategy verevskyi was able to get 74 of all shares through a buyout at an undervalued price in august it was decided to issue an additional $60 million worth of shares which were again bought back by verevskyi in september verevskyi issued shares at pln 116 and bought them back again in fact he gained control over 90 of kernel s shares and can almost withdraw from the warsaw stock exchange and do a squeezeout since he needs at least 95 of all votes now investor pavel boyko has united about 400 minority investors they are trying to protect their rights and prevent the destruction of the company s reputation this is a story first of all about the future of ukraine because while our military is winning on the front some businessmen are ruining the country from within because investments creation of factories rule of law without this ukraine will not be able to exist as a european country pavlo boyko he claims that ukraine defends the interests of ukrainian agrarians and sues countries that ban exports while at the same time the largest agricultural company actually destroys the image of ukraine after such situations it will be extremely difficult for foreign investors to regain confidence in ukrainian companies andriy verevskyi is already well known in ukraine a few years ago the parliament cut vat personally for his company on the back of record profits the oligarch as it turned out has a great influence at least on the legislative branch in ukraine and was a member of the ukrainian national parliament from 2012 to 2013 until the higher administrative court of ukraine revoked his mandate due to a conflict of interest but there is some hope 1 pavlo boyko and other minority shareholders try to sue the oligarch for his shady procedure 2 the pressure on the ukrainian government is growing among others from minority shareholders and poland because kernel holding was traded mainly in poland and was able to grow mainly thanks to polish investors many fear that the government s inaction will deter international investors in the future 3 verevskyinamsen ltd needs at least 95 of all voting shares to do a squeezeout but many investors refuse to sell their shares to namsen maybe they see a huge opportunity in kernel or justdon t want to sell at such a paltry price some aren t even able to do so such as ukrainians since the ukrainian stock market is frozen sources article of obozrevatel russian verison ukrainian version video of an ukrainian minority shareholder russian diskussion from a view months ago

trillions of dollars are about to flow from the fed into the stock market qe has returned stronger than ever edit the fed will charge the 1 year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points for these loans sounds like right now that works out to roughly 5 so this might be a high enough interest rate to deter banks from flooding the fed with these longterm treasuries and effectively causing massive qe we will have to see from this article the fed facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks saving associations credit unions and other institutions those taking advantage of the facility will be asked to pledge highquality collateral such as treasurys agency debt and mortgagebacked securities the fed said it will ease conditions at its discount window which will use the same conditions as the btfp however the new facility offers more favorable terms with a longer duration of loans of one year vs 90 days also securities will be valued at par value rather than the market value assessed at the discount window the haircut or reduction in principal issue is critical as there are estimated to be some $600 billion in unrealized losses that institutions possess in heldtomaturity treasurys and mortgagebacked securities this means that every bank out there that stupidly bought 10 20 30 year treasuries at high prices low yields and are now bagholding with unrealized losses on these bonds will run straight to the fed and loan them to the fed in exchange for the par value read the value of the bonds at maturity ie as if the banks don t have a loss on these bonds in cash now what will the banks do with this cash they are required to hold stable safe assets that have a return and that equals short term treasuries and with the yield curve inversion short term returns more than longer term anyway so winwin for the banks so they are going to go onto the open market and buy these short term treasuries the entities that sell them the treasuries will now be flush with cash and will likely buy stocks with that money the article gives the $600 billion figure as just the on paper losses not the value of the bonds if the losses are $600b then the overall value of the bonds par value will be multiple trillions all of those bonds will be loaned to the fed by the end of the week and by the end of next week all of that money will be in the stock market edit the article does not say what kind of interest rate the fed will charge on these loans if the fed charges an interest rate that is approximate to shortterm treasuries then it may not make much financial sense for banks to run out and do this wholesale has anyone seen any info from the fed about the interest rate they will charge for these 1year loans edit 2 the fed will charge the 1 year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points sounds like right now that works out to roughly 5 maybe a bit more so maybe it s not instantly free money for the banks but the fact that they can borrow more than their collateral is worth could make it worth their while to take this loan
why doesn t stock growth inspire confidence 1 there has been a sharp fall in volatility the average difference between the sp 500 index s daily highs and lows in aprilmay fell to 3866 points less than 1 that figure had been 15 times higher in q1 and it was twice as high in 2022 the last time this range was so low was in november 2021 at the tail end of a bull market rise and just a month before the markets reached their alltime high 2 heavyweights are propping up the major indexes while small caps lag apple s market cap surpassed the entire russell 2000 index s market cap in late april and has remained higher ever since the russell 2000 has grown just 2 this year while apple has surged 34 3 the divergence could signal an impending recession small cap companies are more vulnerable during economic slowdowns and rate hikes this vulnerability is reflected not only in financial indicators but also in investor positioning with a preference for stability even if the debt ceiling issue resolves smoothly and some shortterm risks recede that still won t ensure sustained stock growth

$gme an bad stocksplit explanation on why the bags from are louis vuitton x200b this is a simplified version of what has been talked about nonstop for the last 24 hours everyone has their opinions and like assholes i would love to hear yours the gist of it is that short interest is possibly well over 100 because of darkpool trading which enables some hedge funds to naked short from investopedia naked shorting refers to short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market despite being made illegal after the 200809 financial crisis naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems simplified naked shorting drives a price down when the shorts are layered on and need to be covered at some point with real purchases of shares it allows short interest to exceed 100 of the float or available shares on the open market these are made possible by some market makers who work directly with the hedgies what is hilarious is that these hedgies are thinking this is a good idea when the market makers are often the ones taking the other side meaning they are long which is always good for $gme investors because market makers aren t in the business of losing money if the stock is delivered as a typical stock split dark pool shorts would be unaffected but if it is delivered as a dividend this creates a bit of a dilemma for naked shorts whose stock will not be converted in this 4for1 fashion they will then have to buy 3 shares on the open market for every one they originally owned driving the price up significantly this is all theory and who knows what will happen but if it did it would be hilarious also this analysis sucks so point out issues and know that op appreciates you i basically read a bunch of strings and tried to make it as easy as possible to follow along tldr until july 21 you re going to deal with $gme theoretical posts op tried to make something helpful and succeeded at failing
investor leon cooperman says the us is going through a textbook financial crisis and the sp 500 won t hit a new high for a long time the us is going through a textbook financial crisis and that means investors should expect sluggish returns for in the sp 500 for a long time according to billionaire investor leon cooperman in an interview with bloomberg on monday the omega advisors ceo pointed to recent market volatility stemming from the failure of silicon valley bank which has shaken confidence in the us banking sector this week first republic bank was downgraded for the second time by sp global further into junk territory and credit suisse stock plummeted another 52 on monday following the takeover by ubs announced over the weekend the wall street journal reported that big banks were gearing up for yet another round of aid to first republic just a week after 11 banks poured $30 billion of deposits into the struggling lender shares were down as much as 50 during monday s session it s kind of like textbook cooperman said we have a selfinduced crisis by irresponsible fiscal and monetary policy over the last decade i did not forecast the svb issue but i did have a view that we were heading into a crisis of some kind and we re seeing it other market commentators have blamed the recent tumult on the fed s aggressive monetary policy with central bankers having raised interest rates 1 700 over the last year to quell inflation that s one of the most aggressive tightening cycles the central bank has ever embarked on putting an abrupt end to the prior decade of ultralow interest rates and ample liquidity with svb being the latest casualty fiscal policy is also causing problems thanks to debt levels rising faster than the rate of economic growth in recent years cooperman said his view echoes that of other bearish prognosticators like dr doom nouriel roubini who has warned rising debt could result in a 2008style debt crisis to hit the economy those conditions also mean tepid returns for stocks cooperman said i think the 4 800 on the sp will be a high that will stand for quite some time he said referring to high reached in january 2022 i expect returns in the sp to be very pedestrian previously cooperman said he saw a recession coming for the us economy later this year and warned that the sp 500 could plunge to 3 100 in the nearterm implying a 22 fall from current levels other wall street analysts have predicted a similar freefall with morgan stanley s chief stock strategist warning of a 26 drop for equities source billionaire investor leon cooperman says the us is going through a textbook financial crisis and the sp 500 won t hit a new high for a long time and could plunge 20 this year per bi what do you think of his prediction
til that warren buffett sold 10 year atm put contracts to gay bears before the financial crisis when the sp500 was at 1400 from the semper augustus fund annual letter page 115 berkshire wrote a series of put option contracts just prior to the financial crisis with several life insurance companies as counterparties the options written were european style meaning they are payable only at the expiration of the option which in the case of those berkshire wrote were all well over ten years berkshire received $49 billion upfront as a premium between 2004 and 2008 and unwound 8 of the original contracts in 2010 at a gain of $222 million it is extremely unlikely that berkshire would incur a loss on these remaining contracts the options were written at the money meaning the strike price was set at the market price of the indices at the time the contracts were written the strike for all four three were european indices were written at a time when the sp traded for no higher than 1 400 with the options being european style the indices would have to be below the strike price on the exact day of exercise these contracts were originally written with 12 to 19 years to maturity edit sorry should have been more clear above berkshire will only lose money if the sp500 is below 1400 in 2023 meaning crash 64 from today s levels
