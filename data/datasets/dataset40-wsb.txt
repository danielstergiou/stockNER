$mrvi dd i have 0 idea what this company does but after seeing the most suspicious insider trading post i have ever seen i decided to take a look thinks that mrvi is going to get acquired but doesn t know how options work or how to capitalize on it never traded options before somehow has a lot of conviction x200b put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 this is more important since it measures the number of contracts actually opened numbers from put call ratio is lopsided x200b average volume is around 2m but yesterday there was 6m volume and it went up a decent amount for no reason avg volume vs yesterday mrvi has been getting acquisition offers recently offer was at 42$ per share and was rejected when it was trading at 28$ per share recently there was another offer to buy them out earnings is next week and if there are any potential acquisitions i believe it might be announced around then with the ridiculously high amount of calls vs puts ending on aug 15 along with the unusual activity they are decently cheap if mrvi gets bought out at 42$ it would be trading at a 30$ premium compared to currently each option if bought atm could be 30x100 in profit positions 2x mrvi aug 19 125c 95date is different because i m in different timezone tldr mrvi put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 cheap play that could pay off with a lot of money possible acquisition announced soon edit some more interesting links i ve found biotechne tech exploring takeover of maravai lifesciences mrvi source

sri lanka pm says economy has collapsed unable to buy oil sri lanka s debtladen economy has collapsed after months of shortages of food fuel and electricity its prime minister told lawmakers wednesday in comments underscoring the country s dire situation as it seeks help from international lenders prime minister ranil wickremesinghe told parliament the south asian country is facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel gas electricity and food our economy has completely collapsed while sri lanka s crisis is considered its worst in recent memory wickremesinghe s assertion that the economy has collapsed did not cite any specific new developments it appeared intended to emphasize to his critics and opposition lawmakers that he has inherited a difficult task that can t be fixed quickly as the economy founders under the weight of heavy debts lost tourism revenue and other impacts from the pandemic as well as surging costs for commodities lawmakers of the country s two main opposition parties are boycotting parliament this week to protest against wickremesinghe who became prime minister just over a month ago and is also finance minister for not having delivered on his pledges to turn the economy around wickremesinghe said sri lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel even for cash due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation currently the ceylon petroleum corporation is $700 million in debt he told lawmakers as a result no country or organization in the world is willing to provide fuel to us they are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash he said wickremesinghe took office in may after days of violent protests over the country s economic crisis forced his predecessor to step down in his comments wednesday he blamed the previous government for failing to act in time to turn the situation around as sri lanka s foreign reserves dwindled the foreign currency crisis has crimped imports creating severe shortages of food fuel electricity and other essentials like medicines forcing people to stand in long lines to fulfill basic needs if steps had at least been taken to slow down the collapse of the economy at the beginning we would not be facing this difficult situation today but we lost out on this opportunity we are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom he said sri lanka has been muddling through mainly supported by $4 billion in credit lines from neighboring india but wickremesinghe said india would not be able to keep sri lanka afloat for too long it also has gotten pledges of $300 million$600 million from the world bank to buy medicine and other essential items sri lanka has already announced that it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year pending the outcome of negotiations with the international monetary fund on a rescue package it must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026 officials from international monetary fund are now visiting sri lanka to discuss a rescue package wickremesinghe said that a stafflevel agreement is likely to be reached by the end of july

a beautiful short position in the making $pgr tldr progressive is somehow managing to lag the total market meltdown even though it has a balance sheet that holds no merit whatsoever for some reason puts are extremely cheap even though the company itself seems to be nosediving we all see the commercials everywhere i m sure but what if i told you that the company is in deep deep deep trouble you d probably ask me to show my work right that s a pretty big claim after all first thing s first here s a direct link to their sec 10q so you can verify this yourself for those who take my word for it here s what i m working with x200b net premiums vs net premiums earned net premiums written increased by 11 however net income decreased by 73 and total realized gains decreased by 161 in addition here s an excerpt from their explanation of financial results x200b this all seems like pretty bad news right you don t throw around negative 79 and 218 income values without the stock getting decimated well here s the stock valuation as of today now zoom out the stock should be getting absolutely hammered i m not sure what s going on here but i know that it has a long way down from its current valuation and right now the bets against it are cheap as always don t be an idiot do your own research only invest what you can afford to lose this is not a market environment that is intended to work with you i m not a professional investor but i ll be damned if i don t call opportunity when i see it
rily earnings today and implied move over 25 iv on options is over 500 very low volume today before earnings and shorts have started to cover as shares are now available again today it was sold down from over $50 a share to $15 3 days ago on allegations of fraud that has been cleared by a 3rd party audit fears of bankruptcy from this have been way overblown and earnings today should prove it edit average price $187 sold multiple calls to hedge earnings will look bad because of acquisitions im waiting to see if they keep a dividend then this should spike because it will just be that much more expensive to hold short if they buy back shares then it s primed for a squeeze edit heavily sold about 5 seconds after close no confirmation on buying back shares 10 dividend and no bankruptcy there s 11mil shares short and 5mil float so why do you think it sold off 20 5 seconds after the bell if you bought then sold covered calls to hedge then you aren t down 1520 dividend is still over 10 hold iv will still be extremely high so more calls can be sold to hedge more
