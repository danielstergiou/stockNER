      "text": "$mrvi dd i have 0 idea what this company does but after seeing the most suspicious insider trading post i have ever seen i decided to take a look thinks that mrvi is going to get acquired but doesn t know how options work or how to capitalize on it never traded options before somehow has a lot of conviction x200b put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 this is more important since it measures the number of contracts actually opened numbers from put call ratio is lopsided x200b average volume is around 2m but yesterday there was 6m volume and it went up a decent amount for no reason avg volume vs yesterday mrvi has been getting acquisition offers recently offer was at 42$ per share and was rejected when it was trading at 28$ per share recently there was another offer to buy them out earnings is next week and if there are any potential acquisitions i believe it might be announced around then with the ridiculously high amount of calls vs puts ending on aug 15 along with the unusual activity they are decently cheap if mrvi gets bought out at 42$ it would be trading at a 30$ premium compared to currently each option if bought atm could be 30x100 in profit positions 2x mrvi aug 19 125c 95date is different because i m in different timezone tldr mrvi put call ratio yesterday was 0007 10k open interest in call volume vs 1k in puts earnings next week put call oi ratio is 0005 cheap play that could pay off with a lot of money possible acquisition announced soon edit some more interesting links i ve found biotechne tech exploring takeover of maravai lifesciences mrvi source"
