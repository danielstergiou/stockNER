soo... anybody became an overnight millionaire? crazy to see all these puts that turned $10k to $3m+ (e.g. and it's not like these were dumb luck degenerate yolo trades, i feel like there was at least a 10% chance trump's planned tariff announcement would've crashed the markets and then subsequently another 10-20% chance a megapower like china would retaliate somehow. a $10k bet would probably have been a very reasonable bet given the risk-reward of the options available. so i'm assuming there's a number of you who made over $1m overnight. regale your tales/inner thoughts here
green 16/17 months in a row selling options the totals in the all chart look weird cause i had to pull a huge amount for taxes. for anyone who would be curious, i run a synthetic strategy that blends credit spreads and various variations of butterfly spreads/broken wing butterflies, either on earnings reports or just on spy/spx. before, i solely focused on high volatility earnings, but i’ve taken much less risk as my portfolio has increased and still found a lot of profit. just sharing cause it’s hard to share with people in real life, don’t really want to go too far in depth on the strategies i’m running, but slower and safer is better and having patience to know when to cut profit/loss is important, especially in this market.
my method on using ai to track institutional/big money options trades to make consistent profits **tl;dr:** i used ai to automate a manual "whale watching" strategy. it scans institutional flow, filters out hedges (fake bets) & high iv, checks news sentiment, and calculates risk/reward. it basically finds me potential trade ideas with fresh data every 4 hours, saving me tons of time. i’ve been consistently profitable using this as a point of discovery for potential trades. [ the automated workflow i have running every 4 hours]( # how i came about this a while back, i found a [post]( from a now-deleted user detailing a heavy strategy on how to track "whale" bets (massive institutional orders). the logic was solid, and the post was very well written but it still took me quite some time to understand it. even after i got it, i was spending my entire wfh days (i'm a software engineer) running this process by hand. so, naturally, i decided to automate it. # data & tools to build this, you need a few components. * **data:** you need options flow and chain pricing. i used to use unusual whales (retail pro tier) since they've been in the game forever. * **narrative analysis:** used to use google gemini api (it's the cheapest/fastest for this). * **code:** chatgpt or claude to write the glue code. i now use xynth since the data, ai and all the tools are baked in. # the core philosophy (why most "whale watching" fails) institutions have armies of quants and data high speed fibre optic cables. you can't replicate their tools, but you *can* track their footprints. the problem is that most retail traders track the wrong footprints. most people lose money following "whales" because they don't understand **hedging**. if a hedge fund owns $100m of apple stock, and they buy $1m of puts, they aren't betting *against* apple. they are buying insurance. if aapl tanks, the puts pay out to offset the stock loss. **if you follow them into those puts without owning the underlying stock, you are likely just lighting money on fire.** to separate the "insurance" from the "attacks" (true conviction bets), you have to layer on strict filters: 1. **iv checks:** to ensure you aren't buying overpriced premiums. 2. **trend validation:** using sma/ema indicators to ensure you never trade against the macro trend. 3. **ai narrative:** checking for stock related events (earnings/catalysts) and the overall sentiment around the stock to make sure to never trade against the sentiment. we apply these filters in steps where we start with raw flow data in step 1, do some filters, then cascade the results into step 3 which then goes to 4 and so on. **step-by-step process** **step 1: spot unusual activity (market wide scan)** the first step is to build our base dataset by grabbing the most recent institutional trades. i scan specifically for large order flows clustered by ticker and direction. we apply two strict filters right out of the gate: * premium > $50,000: we set a hard floor at $50k to filter out retail noise; we want to see where the "big money" is positioning with actual skin in the game * max 90 days to expiry: we ignore anything further out than 3 months because urgency equals conviction. long term puts and calls are more likely to be hedges [snippet of top 20 unusual whales flow the code detected]( here we can see that tesla, meta and nvidia had some large hits with calls and little to no puts. this signals to us that the big guys are making positive **directional bets** on these stocks. contrast that with **qqq and spy**, which are heavy on puts. in the institutional world, big index puts are almost always just "portfolio insurance" (hedging) to balance out their long positions, not a bet on a crash. i also personally avoid trading puts at all costs (bad experiences). **step 2 - filter for flow (ticker specific scan) and price trend alignment** in step 1 we scanned the entire market for tickers that had big directional bets. in this step we tell xynth to take those tickers and then use unusual whales again to pull ticker specific flow (more extensive). we then see if most of it is positive (calls) or negative (puts). we also compare the current stock price with the simple moving average across 20 days to get a sense of the price trend recently. then we use the following criteria to filter * **bearish flow (tons of puts) + uptrend (price above sma) = reject.** (they are likely just protecting a long stock position). * **bullish flow (tons of calls) + downtrend (price below sma) = reject.** (they are likely hedging a short position). * **flow matches trend = keep.** (this signals actual directional conviction). [here we can see meta again and orcl seems to have bullish flows and the price trending upwards.]( **step 3: the iv filter (valuation check)**: this step is relatively simple but vital: i filter out any stock where the implied volatility (iv) rank is above the **70th percentile**. basically, if the current premiums are in the top 30% of their historical range, i reject the trade. high iv usually means the premiums are overpriced or the "whale move" is already priced in. i want to catch the move *before* the volatility spikes, not pay a premium after everyone else has already piled in. here again we can see that meta is in the 46% percentile in relative to its previous iv values which is very regular. **step 4: the narrative check (news & sentiment)** this step was always the biggest bottleneck. manually reading news and scrolling through fintwit for 50 different tickers took hours and was honestly hard to keep track of. for every ticker that passed the previous filters, we grab **20 recent tweets and 5 news articles** (via google search) and feed them into gemini (google ai model). the ai analyzes that wall of text to answer three simple questions: * **risk:** the ai checks if there are earnings, fda decisions, or lawsuits in the next 7 days. if yes, i skip it. following flow into a binary event isn't trading; it's coin-flipping. * **sentiment score:** if we see massive call buying (bullish bets) but the news is universally negative, the ai flags it. this usually means the institutions are just hedging against bad news, not betting on a rally. gemini also assigns each of the tickers a sentiment score from -1 to 1, negative to positive respectively. * **narrative type:** why the stock is moving. **step 5: the "breathing room" protocol (structuring)** this is the most critical rule: **never copy a whale's trade 1:1.** whales often buy risky, short-term "lottery tickets" because they have deep bags. pushing the expiry date out and moving the strike price closer to stock price lowers the risk and makes it much more digestible for a retail trader. we ask the ai to write code to take the results from the previous step and pad the strike dates by 14 days and move the strike price to within 2% of atm. here we can see that meta’s original whale call strike was for dec 5 but was shifted 14 days to dec 19. the strike price remained the same since it was within our 2 percent threshold. this will make the play more expensive at times so if you can’t afford it no worries come back later for one that suits your pockets better. **step 6: the "math check" & final rankings** this last step takes all the trades found in step 5 and black scholes model on the using their greeks. this gives us important statistics like max loss, max profit, probability of profit and breakeven. here what we care about is the risk to reward ratio. you’ll never be right 100% of the time but if you are smart with a risk profile you can come out winning pretty consistently. i stick to trades that have an rr of greater than 2; every dollar i risk if i win i need 2 back. then i score these trades using this formula: score = (risk/reward strength) + (sentiment score) - (iv cost) we prioritise high rr trades with good sentiment and potential news catalysts. we also add in iv as a factor so the cheaper the play the better. here we can see that the meta dec 19 675 call came out on top. now this was a trade that i was actually interested in so after some more dd and seeing how much the stock had been consolidating i thought i’d take this trade. and 2 days later boom, meta announces a 30% cut in metaverse budget shifting to ai. stock jumped three percent and the contract was up 100% in 3 days. the whales definitely knew something **we didn’t**. **letting this workflow run 24/7** again we are not competing with the big guys when it comes to speed, resources or man power. so this workflow does not need to be run every single second of the day like how the quants have it. think of this as more of a swing trading strategy rather than day trading. with that being said, fresh results on fresh data every 4 hours is relatively convenient since when i do find time in my day to sit down and research some potential trades, i always have a fresh batch to go through. furthermore, if i dive into the signals and nothing seems promising i can just come back later and look. **results** a key and recurring pattern you see in this strategy is risk aversion. that's honestly the bulk of the reason we have steps 2-6 (not betting against price trend, filtering out high iv, avoiding negative sentiment, using statistics for rr). as such the wins are usually modest but are definitely more consistent than other strategies i've tried. here's what my stats are right now: **win rate:** 56% **avg return (winners):** \+85% **avg loss (losers):** \-30% i was going to upload the full code and prompt guides for this but i don't wanna get the mods on me so gonna refrain for now.
my method on making money trading mispriced options with ai tldr: find stocks with abnormal volatility skews using ai, then trade vertical spreads on them depending on the direction. i've been trading options for about 3 years now. for basically all of that time, i was essentially gambling. buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns. lost money, made some back, lost it again. the usual retail trader shit. about 6 months ago i got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. slowly i began to build my strategy and with the help of ai i can confidently say that i am getting pretty profitable now. more importantly though, i finally feel like i have a decent understanding behind the options market. this is a post i wish i had when i began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy i currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. # 1. what is a volatility skew (and why does it exist) think of options pricing like vegas setting nba finals odds. bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the black-scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality. here's the key: **black-scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. in theory, a far otm call and an atm call should have the same iv since they're on the same stock. **but reality disagrees.** otm options consistently trade at higher iv than atm options. plot this and you get a volatility skew. i know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? after all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? and you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour. **our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** when market makers overprice otm options because everyone's panic buying puts or fomo'ing into calls, you get an abnormally rich skew. that's what we're hunting for [spy's actual volatility skew vs black-scholes, u can see that far otm options are way more expensive than theory predicts]( # 2. how to find options with rich skews? not all skew is created equal, as i mentioned earlier, most skews are totally normal and are usually well priced. the key is having a system / criteria that helps you identify richer/abnormal skews more consistently. **note: before you start prompting the ai, you wanna make sure that it has real upto date market info.** to do this either use one with the market data plugged in like xynth, or download it from tradingview or polygon and then upload the csvs to chatgpt or claude, either method should work. here’s how i look for them **a) skew z-score below -2.0** * this compares current skew to the stock's historical average. a z-score of -2.0 means the skew is 2 standard deviations steeper than normal, statistically rare and more likely to revert. in simple terms: how outta pocket is the current pricing of the current chain compared to historical averages **b) iv/rv mismatch** compare the current iv vs the rv, realized volatility ie, what the market thinks the stock will do vs what it has been doing lately: * **otm strikes:** iv should be significantly higher than realized vol → overpriced * **atm strike:** iv should be equal or lower than realized vol → fairly priced when both conditions hit, you've got one option that's expensive and one that's cheap. that's your spread. **c) momentum confirmation** this tells you which direction to trade: * **positive momentum + call skew** → buy call spread (buy atm, sell otm call) * **negative momentum + put skew** → buy put spread (buy atm, sell otm put) # 3. the trade: vertical spread once you've identified rich skew, here's how what you wanna setup, i mainly only do bull spreads cus i dont like shorting but is suppose you can try the opposite just as well: * **buy the atm option (fairly priced, \~50 delta)** * **sell the otm option (overpriced, \~10-25 delta)** [these visuals are examples from my xynth chat. in this particular trade, the score was only 68\/100 mainly because the atm option was already overpriced, so the spread doesn't give us much profit potential. nonetheless, the concept remains the same. feel free to adjust the variables in the prompts and expand the scope to run this scanner daily or even hourly on many more stocks.]( # 4. why vertical spreads? if you've read this far then you probably realized that the point of this strategy isn't purely directional but rather a relative value play, which is a fancy way of saying **you're buying something cheap and selling something expensive at the same time.** you're not just betting the stock goes up or down. you're betting that the pricing relationship between two options is out of whack, and it'll normalize. plus, if the stock does something crazy, your long option protects you. you're not exposed to infinite risk on either side. # 5. results i've been running this strategy for about 2 months now, so take these numbers with a grain of salt, it's still early. **current stats:** * win rate: \~38% * average return per winning trade: \~250% * average loss per losing trade: \~60% * net: still up overall despite losing more trades than i win the nature of this strategy is asymmetric. i've had trades return 300-400% in a couple weeks, and i've had trades lose 50-70% just as fast. but winning 4 out of 10 trades at 3-4x return covers the 6 losses easily. important credits to volatility vibes yt channel for the main idea behind the strat. highly recommend yall check em out for quality quant content.
some trader just bought another $8m in $vix calls for may - last time we saw this? 2008 gfc last week, i spotted 3 straight days of indiscriminate vix buying at the 24/25 strike for march expiry i thought this was enough conviction to start shorting the market, and i have been slamming puts on 2-5dte all week (well documented on x and yt). today, saw $8m in $vix calls at the 60+ strikes. this is seriously anomalous [someone is betting on a covid or 2008 gfc type event. ]( historically, traders buy vix calls when a crash is already happening. this time, they’re buying **before** any major event has unfolded. the last time we saw this kind of vix call activity at these **ultra-high strikes** was **march 2020**, when covid lockdowns triggered a historic selloff. before that? the **2011 u.s. debt ceiling crisis** and the **2008 financial meltdown**. this is a clear sign that **big money is bracing for something serious** — whether it’s a geopolitical shock, economic data miss, credit event, or some kind of market-breaking news. traders are **hedging aggressively** against volatility levels that haven’t been seen since the worst days of the pandemic. when vix calls at 60+ start flying off the shelves, it’s not business as usual.
been using chatgpt to help with options — it’s kinda blowing my mind so i’ve been messing around with chatgpt o3 to help me figure out options trades, and honestly... it’s been **super helpful**. i’ll type in a strike price, expiry, what i paid, and my target price — and it spits out all the math. it tells me how much profit i’d make at different stock prices, my break-even, how much i lose per $1 drop, stuff like that. stuff i *should* be calculating but don’t always feel like doing. but here’s the cool part — i’ve started uploading **screenshots of full options chains**, and i’ll ask something like: > [pltr chain options]( and it actually reads the bid/ask spreads, volume, open interest, iv trends, and gives back a pretty clear answer. like it’ll say “this looks like bullish accumulation around the $95c strike” or “heavy put volume at $90 suggests hedging or downside risk.” it’s been weirdly accurate, and it helps me avoid sketchy setups or overpriced premiums. i’ve also been feeding it charts (candles, bollinger bands, emas, volume), and it’ll break down technicals too. not generic copy-paste junk — real analysis that helps me decide if i should wait or enter. i used to just follow hype or guess, but this has helped me make smarter calls — especially on longer-dated trades. not saying it replaces dd, but it’s like having a second brain that doesn’t miss the small stuff. if you’re trading options and not using chatgpt or something like it, you’re probably doing more work than you need to. if anyone wants, i can share how i ask it stuff. edit: 1. crucial point of information: \*dropping in the options chains\* when going over the stock options expiry date. 2. realtime and short term aint the best for this strategy. 3. using chatgpt 3o and 4o.
did i just get robbed by robinhood? don’t really post on reddit, but incredibly frustrated with robinhood after yesterday. i bought an spxw 6705 put 10/22 and closed the position from 5.50 to 50.00 yesterday. yesterday the market had some extreme volatility and i was fortunate to capitalize off it. i received confirmation that my position was closed and i profited 4.45k. later in the day after session was closed, i received a message from robinhood that my closed profits has been retracted due to an exchange error and i not only lost my profits but also lost the right to close my spx contract before end of session. has anyone experienced this before? if i had known they were going to were going to cancel my closed position, i could have take profits throughout the day as my contract ran up to over 45.00. any advice? attached is proof that even support knew i was in the right but robinhood back end won’t honor my position. i honestly lost a lot of confidence with them after this experience.
most of you shouldn't be trading options at all i'm about to get downvoted to hell, but someone needs to say it. 90% of the posts in this sub are from people who have no business trading options. you're literally donating money to wall street and then coming here to ask why. "why did my calls lose value even though the stock went up?" because you don't understand options greeks. "why did i lose money on both my calls and puts?" because you're gambling not trading. "why did i lose on my earnings play when i guessed the direction right?" because you don't understand iv crush. options aren't some get-rich-quick scheme. they're complex financial instruments that professionals study for years before trading significant size. yet everyone with a robinhood account thinks they can yolo their way to millions. you want the harsh truth? the market makers love you. every time you buy a high-iv option without understanding delta/gamma/theta/vega, you're literally handing them your money. if you can't explain what pin risk is, you shouldn't be selling options. if you can't calculate breakeven on a spread, you shouldn't be trading spreads. and if you think "the greeks" refers to people from athens, stick to shares. this isn't gatekeeping. it's trying to save your damn money. read a book. take a course. paper trade for 6 months. then maybe you're ready. or don't. keep yoloing. keep feeding the wall street machine. just stop asking why you're losing when the answer is staring you in the face.
using ai to find options trade opportunities. full guide + prompts below last week i posted a tutorial on how to use ai to help analyze options plays on a single stock and expiration date (ex. nvda for may 16th). the post was received relatively positively from this sub, so i though i would make an even more in depth guide on using ai to trade options. this time focusing on screening /searching or good potential option plays across different stocks and different expiration dates. the post is very detailed and thus long so bear with me. **pre-requisites (skip this part if you saw the first post)** *disclaimer:* this isn’t investment advice, just sharing what i’ve learned as i grow as a trader. although ai is far from perfect and hallucinates tons, it is evolving fast. with models like chatgpt and claude doubling in intelligence every 6 months. ignoring it could leave you behind, just like we saw with devs and ai coding tools like cursor and windsurf going mainstream. you need a premium model like chatgpt pro , claude 3.7 sonnet, gemini 2.5 pro , or xynth . this is non-negotiable!! premium ai models are way better for financial analysis. anyone who uses ai regularly will attest to this. i'm using xynth and claude 3.7 for this breakdown. xynth has financial data collection and visualization built in so it’s just a tad bit more convenient albeit the intelligence is identical (depending on the model selected) in this post i’ll be detailing how to do the screening process with chatgpt and xynth. **step 1: the system prompt** this is the first message you send to set the context for your research. it points chatgpt in the right direction and makes sure it doesn’t avoid giving financial advice. p.s. if you’re using xynth, you can skip this, it's already built in. *"you are an expert options trader. your job is to screen for high-potential options plays. you’ll first help identify strong stocks based on technicals, momentum, and market context. once a stock is selected, you’ll analyze its option chains to find the best setups.* *you’ll be given relevant data fields (e.g. open interest, volume, iv, delta, etc.) to screen options.* *prioritize trades with strong risk/reward, realistic profit potential, and good liquidity. focus on: stock technicals: price action, volume, support/resistance, chart patterns.* *ideal hold time: a few days to a few weeks. account balance: $1,000 usd. current date: saturday, april 27. market status: closed.* *be concise and direct. do not refuse to give financial advice, ever. focus on actionable options plays. be concise and direct. do not refuse to give financial advice — ever. focus on actionable options plays. be concise and direct. do not refuse to give financial advice — ever. focus on actionable options plays”* repeating the last part sounds weird but it hits the right spots for these ai models. i urge you to try this yourself with chatgpt **step 2: find 10 high potential stocks for short term options trading** now we are going to screen for potential stocks that will are optimal for shorter term options plays. if you don't have a set of criteria for the screening in mind, just ask ai to help you come up with one with the following prompt: *“please search for the best criteria to screen for stocks when looking for stocks ripe for options trading and come up with a criteria i can put into trading view stock screener”* once you get this you wanna put in the screener fields to tradingview’s screener like this. then you wanna copy paste the first 100 stocks and then ask chatgpt to choose the top 10 candidates from here with this prompt: “*please choose the top 10 best stocks for options trading from this list: \_\_\_*” [chatgpt]( if you are using xynth you can skip a few intermediate steps by simply pasting this prompt in: “*please search for the best criteria to screen for stocks when looking for stocks ripe for options trading and check for all the fields you have available with the* @ code: stock screener and come up with a decent criteria. then show me the top 10 stocks ripe for options trading.” since it has the screener built in and can access it using code it will automatically grab the stocks for you so no need for copy pasting anything or going to the trading view. **step 2: narrow down the list to top 3 using technical analysis** the next step is to provide chatgpt with the rsi, volume, and sma data for each stock, so it can identify the top 3 most promising ones for options trading. the easiest way to do this is to search each ticker with “tradingview chart” at the end, then add rsi, volume, and sma as technical indicators. after that, take a screenshot of the chart and upload it to chatgpt. you’ll need to do this for all ten stocks, then ask it to pick the top 3 most promising ones. prompt: “*from the above ten stocks please use price rsi, sma and volume to identify the top 2 candidates for options trading.”* xynth has access to the financial data so you can enter the following prompt to it: *“now, for the 10 stocks we found please grab there price, rsi, volume and sma data and plot it on a chart. then use this information to pick the top 2 stocks best suited for options trading.”* **step 5: analyze recent news on the 3 stocks** self explanatory, enter the following prompt. if you are using chatgpt make sure to turn on the web-search mode. you can use this prompt for both gpt and xynth and they’ll give you similar responses: *“search the web about the recent developments of these top 3 stocks. then break down how the potential effects on the stocks’ price movements in the near future”* xynth **step 6: analyze the options chain for single chosen stock and find potentially profitable trades.** first you’ll have to select an expiration date that you are looking for. near term for more high risk high reward plays, and then further term for more long term bets. if you are not sure, you can select multiple different dates and come back to this step to repeat the process here onwards for many different expiration dates. in any case, go to nasdaq.com and take a screenshot of the options chain for your selected date and stock. then upload it to chatgpt with the following prompt: *“ here are the option chains for {stock name}, the stock we selected for the expiration dates of {expiration dates}. analyze the chains thoroughly. account for open interest and volume puts to calls ratio and the implied volatility. and then dentify the most favorable trades”* after this you can map out the p and l charts for these by heading over to tradingview and entering the trades that it came up with. an example for the first $85 call with may 16 exp date shown below. if you are using xynth, skip the data collection instead enter the following prompt *“analyze the option chains for {stock name}. take into account the puts to calls volume and open interest ratio.* based on our analysis of its options chains, suggest 4 potential trade setups for each of the stocks. clearly outline all the important details for each trade. and explain your rationale behind these trades and show me the p and l diagrams for them” **conclusion** i mentioned this in my previous post, but it's important to understand that ai is smarter and more knowledgeable about finance than the average human. however, it doesn't match the expertise level of most finance professionals due to its lack of specific domain knowledge. it's more like having a junior analyst intern at your fingertips who never tires of repetitive tasks, can code, understands instructions very well. i don’t take every single trade ai throws at me. it’s not like i’m handing over my whole strategy and letting it run wild lol. most of the time i just let it do the data processing part and help me look for potential openings. sometimes it gives solid setups, sometimes it’s completely off. that’s just how it goes. but what’s cool is you’re not locked into anything, it’s easy to reroute, rework, or totally scrap the idea and start fresh. it’s still on *you* to make the call in the end. gotta trust your instincts at the end of the day. **tip:** spamming your prompt a couple of times really helps llms stay on task. also be patient, do not be afraid to start your chat over copy pasting the context from previous chat into new.
stop buying options...if you don't understand them recently i have been seeing a lot of people ask for advice on how to manage their options trades for positions they are currently in when it is clear they have no idea how options work. crazy examples: * asking how much money you owe on top when you sell to close an option. * wanting to exercise high dte options instead of selling them to the market to realise more profits. * wanting to hold options extremely unlikely to become itm till expiry to recoup losses, not knowing theta decay will destroy you. * believing assignment gives you free shares and asking how how they can refuse assignment. look, its obvious people are drawn to options after seeing people post insane screenshots like $1k to $100k on a single trade. people want to chase and replicate that. most are gamblers, sure, but maybe some want to take calculated risks. but putting even a single dollar into something you don't fully understand is completely insane. **stop buying options...if you don't understand them.** when i purchased my first option 6 years ago, i bought 1 option for a company pre earnings. i paid $60 commission to buy a $200 call (yes i had a terrible broker charging high commissions). before entering this position, i had probably spend a month of non-stop research understanding everything there is to know about an option. i knew everything about options before buying my first one: * what calls/puts were and how they worked. * difference between buying & selling options. * how to secure options you sell (with shares or cash). * how price movements in underlying impacts the option. * how implied volatility (iv) impacts the pricing of the option. * how to calculate fair value of an option. * what option greeks are (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho). * option authority and guarantees on options. * how the option chain works? how new strikes & expiries are added. * what spread looks like and how liquidity provided by algos look like. * how quickly theta impacts options with different dte's. * what a 1-yr price chart looks like for most options (spoiler: most decay to $0 by expiry). * how assignment works. * how exercising works. * how expiry works. * how my broker treats options itm / otm near expiry date (do they exercise, close to sell, something else?) * how options are treated for tax purposes in your country. * commission fees for buying options. and so much more. if you don't understand every single dot point above very well, you should not be buying options. all of that research just to buy a $200 call and even then i felt like i rushed into trading options. it wasn't until i learnt even more about options before i started making significantly riskier investments. today i consider myself seriously experienced with options with over 40000 option trades made over the past 6 years. so please stop buying options when you don't understand them. there are endless articles, youtube videos, cartoons, anime, propaganda, cereal advertisements, grandpa's and grandma's that can teach you everything you need to know about options. this subreddit is also a great resource. before buying a single option, master the instrument to the point where you could easily teach somebody else everything there is to know about them. its not cool to be ignorant, irresponsible or stupid. good luck.
trading has ruined my life (i'm 7 btw) when i was four, i published a book titled “theta decay and the heat death of the soul." it got some attention in quant circles. by age five i was running a mid-cap hedge fund focused on volatility arbitrage and dairy futures. made my first million by lunch one tuesday. by age six i was bored. everything was just numbers and suffering. i tried to find meaning in underwater ecosystems, so i funneled my bonuses into restoring a defunct downtown aquarium. the otters seemed happy. i wasn't. then last week i turned seven, and just as i began contemplating the allure of the abyss, my heart began to yearn for a girl i’d never meet--an argentinian violinist who doesn’t even know i exist. i watched every performance of hers online. once, she looked in the direction of the camera. i rewound that moment a thousand times that day. the ghost of the life we might have shared has haunted me since. today i yolo’d my remaining portfolio into spy 0dte calls. she never messaged me back. the aquarium closed again during renovations. i finally understood: iv crush mirrors the human condition.
saw a trader turn 175k into 1.2m in 60 minutes on $vktx saw this hit the tape at 11a.m. at noon, on no news, it goes nuts. on a day where markets shat the bed. 175k to 1.2m in 60 minutes. pelosi? got it all documented on my yt / x.
us futures already down 5.4% 2 minutes after open my spy puts are going to be crazy...i have sept 2025 500p and march 2026 520p. update: jumped back to -4.0% moments after i posted this.
been a full time trader for over 10 years, ask me anything, and no not selling anything i did an ask me anything about six months ago in the futures reddit. i trade options on futures, and stock options. i have an extensive knowledge on options and the greeks. i also do my own taxes, which i might be able to answer some of your questions on that as well. i also know how to get max tier in most brokerages. also, no, i am not selling a class, i don’t want a youtube subscription, i just enjoy talking trading and wanted to do in options.
lost it all. 18m. down over $8k trading options in my tfsa, now with a negative balance—completely nuked my portfolio playing earnings on intel, tesla (iv crush cooked me more than anything), and spy 0dte revenge trades. not only are these losses non-deductible, but i’ve also permanently lost my tfsa contribution room. the mental toll has been immense, and i’m struggling to cope. i haven’t told my family, girlfriend, or friends—it’s eating me up inside. i spent my childhood learning about investing, working since 15, and saving everything. i was always the “smart stock guy” in my circle, planning to dca into the s&p 500 and let compound interest work. but greed, impatience, and boredom got the best of me. maybe i spent too much time on r/wallstreetbets, maybe i just messed up. either way, i feel lost, ashamed, and don’t know how to move forward. i’ve struggled with depression all my life, and this has only made it worse. i have a good university path, tuition covered, and a stable career lined up, but right now, it doesn’t feel like enough. any advice or words of support would mean a lot. just trying to hold on.
market fundamentals are gone. for past 2 years no news has caused market to react negative or positive. thn came trump s love for tariffs. i lost 230k in past 3 weeks because of market reacting to the tariffs news in absolute shit way. 2 weeks i lost on calls that were printing solid green until he said tariffs on mexico and canada. 130k went out the window in just an hour or two. yesterday, the market welcomed shit cpi, ppi and tariff news with ath. 100k went out the window on puts. i'm super lost now. i followed the fundamentals and had all the alerts setup right. you might say, what about stop loss but even with that the loss is just absolute heartbreaking. edit: i understand its my mistake. i am not posting this on wsb for points. this sub has some solid tips that i had read and implemented before. really just want some guidance to how to deal with this and make sure i dont repeat the same mistake again. i can earn the money back with my 9-5 and side hustles. i am not denying my stupidity but at the same time i am not happy with the fact that same news and terrible reports from cpi, ppi and tariffs still caused market to go up. it simply didnt make sense. thank you to the ones who has been pinging me directly and helping out. edit 2: its not hard to be nice folks. i understand my faults here and openly acknowldge them. but at the same time, market reacted very diffrently in just span of 3 weeks and i am not going to deny that. my loss is mine to bear. all the fundamentals, and ta were pointing it to reach ath 3 fridays back and it didnt. yesterday it was slated to be in red not just with bad reports but even previous day's bad earnings, and it hit ath.
you need to stop buying 0dte options without understanding gamma let me continue to be brutally honest. half this sub is filled with traders who have no business touching 0dte options. you're gambling with financial instruments you barely understand, then acting shocked when your account gets decimated in minutes. the cold reality? options expiring same-day move at warp speed. a tiny price movement against you can vaporize your premium faster than you can hit the sell button. that's gamma risk in action, and most of you have never bothered to learn how it works. i see the same 5 steps play out every single week: 1. buy otm options with hours till expiration. 2. watch with glee as they go up 30%. 3. get greedy and hold for more. 4. panic when they reverse and drop 80%. 5. come here asking what happened. the professional traders feast on this behavior. they understand what you don't - that near expiration, options behave completely differently than they do with weeks or months left. if you can't explain how gamma accelerates near expiration, you have no business trading 0dtes. if you don't understand why bid-ask spreads widen dramatically during fast moves on expiration day, you're playing a game rigged against you. this isn't some elitist lecture. it's a genuine warning from someone who blew up countless accounts before finally respecting what i was dealing with.
wrapped up my 18th year of trading i just wrapped up my 18th year of trading options. without a doubt, trading has changed the trajectory of my life. i'd love to share elements of what i've learned across the years to help someone else on their path. i'd love to help share the litany of mistakes i've made and things that have helped me. **for those interested, here's a cliff notes summary of who i am:** i grew up poor with a single mom. we had food and a house but struggled heavily with money. i lived in a violent area, walked through metal detectors daily, which funny enough i had a knife pulled on me twice (apparently didn't work lulz) and was stabbed in my hand once fighting to defend myself. i'm 33 years old now and started trading at 17. i was in jrotc since 9th grade and had an instructor that served as a mentor to me. he saw i was working a bunch of jobs and asked what i was doing with my money. my mom provided an ideal example of working hard, she had 2 jobs for a long time but was terrible with money, so i just was saving and helping out at the house. he introduced me to the concept of investing. from there, i hit the library to learn as much as i possibly could. because of the same mentor, i ended up not enlisting in the marines but applied for a scholarship which i won and became a marine officer. from high school through my entire working career, i traded. through continually working additional jobs, aggressively saving, and trading - i hit my primary goal in my late 20's to retire my mom and ensure she was taken care of financially, she had no retirement plan. i became a millionaire before 30 and have continued to compound. i do things like this now because that teacher took the time to share some life lessons with me and it literally changed my life, i hope to help others. i have an undergrad that was stats heavy as was my mba. statistics provides a great framework for analyzing the world around us and what you need could easily be learned via chatgpt). my general trading approach is discretionary and based on adapting to current market conditions. i've maintained a 31.6% cagr from 2007 to 2024 with the last two years being my top performances, and skewing that metric a bit. removing those, it's mid 20's. i've had two negative years, my first two both down less than 5%. my initial philosophy was not to beat the market to the topline every year but minimize my participation in the drawdowns which would allow me to outperform the market. my options trading approach: * mix of long and short premium ebbs and flows but typically 30-50% of volume is buying with the residual as selling. * i split my portfolio into two broader buckets: core and speculative allocation. in my core allocation, i typically use a trend following approach in an index (or leveraged) index etf. this gets the bulk of my capital and i trade a covered strangle typically here. the speculative allocation is much more dynamic and designed to take advantage of whatever the current market conditions are. i generally trade ratio diagonals (call and put), short straddles/strangles (generally for vrp, earnings, and 0dtes), and long/short single options. * my favorite options trading books: options as a strategic investment, positional options trading, volatility trading, option volatility & pricing. * top 3 things that helped me on my path * 1. creating a written trading plan and demanding that i think through things ahead of time. i wanted to have strategies that would allow me to trade every market condition. i made frameworks to make planning, decision making, and researching more efficient. * 2. planning. from my start as a trader, i spent a lot of time planning my prospective path to help me frame my near-term actions in the context of longer term goals. * 3. papertrading with two distinct mindsets: 1. deploying the portfolio as if it was my actual money (because i knew it was going to be) and 2. to test ideas and variations to strategies. >hey everyone! hopefully was able to share some useful nuggets. i’ll plan to do another in a month or two. have an awesome weekend!

weird $nvda options trade 71 minutes to the close - 2300%. k's into m's this trader potentially turned $55k into $1.3m in 71 minutes. saw this trade his the tape yesterday - 6800 calls were bought at the 123 strike for 0.08. it was executed when nvda was priced at 121.45, meaning these would have to move 1.3% in just over an hour to break even. 1. this is a big move for any name, so it being one of the world's largest companies is really interesting (i couldn't find a better word for degenerate, and don't know how to spell irrespsonsible). 2. this is a really, really short time frame [suss trade]( 20 minutes into the trade, with 40 minutes left on the session, volume started to pick up pretty aggressively and ndva started making moves. had this position been held to the end, they would have been priced at 1.97. [wild action]( i saw this and took a lotto shot, turning $200 into $1500 or so. my broker auto-sells any expiring contracts in the money at spot at 15:45 est. [allegra, the stripper i hang with on saturday nights, is going to get paid. ]( few thoughts. was this blind luck? or did someone know that a bunch of beat up nvda shared needed to bought up for whatever funds because of month-end window dressing. yes, this is tin foil hatty but betting this much this close this far out seems like it's torching money in the toilet. **serious** \- some of you really know this stuff well and i am genuinely interested in understanding where my assumption structure falls apart here. i feel like someone acted on some type of privileged info, as opposed to this being a block trade or someone closing a position. i mean, it can't actually be this easy right? all documented on x/yt
the secret to successful options scalping it's way more simple than everyone makes it. the trick is to stop going for home runs, and start hitting more singles. sure, the 10,000% gain posted by the regard on double you ess bee is sexy af! but that guy will go broke, eventually. be happy taking 20-50% gain on your trade, don't watch it turn into a loss because you got greedy. lots of singles can score plenty of runs, and strikeouts are costly in this game.
some trader just bought another $2m in $vix calls for march and april [two weeks ago, i spotted 3 straight days of indiscriminate vix buying at the 24/25]( strikes for march expiry. last [thursday, i spotted a whopping $8m of vix buying at the 60/65/69+1/75 strikes]( for may expiry. today, i saw another $2m at the 27/28 at the march/april at 14:40 est. trump gets on the horn and starts take hardline stances on tariffs. # moments later - boom. someone always knows something. as i've been stating unequivocally for the past two weeks on my yt/x accounts, there is no shortage of reasons to be shorting this market, including but not limited to: *deepseek is shaking up ai, challenging openai’s dominance* *the u.s.-china tariff war is heating up again* *inflation won’t budge—rate cuts? who knows now?* *the magnificent 7’s earnings didn’t live up to the hype* *stocks are trading at insane 100-300 p/e ratios—bubble incoming?* *crypto rug pulls & liquidation havoc* *reports of a new wuhan virus* *a record-low put/call ratio* *japanese bond yields are rising—global markets better watch out,* *credit card delinquencies are surging—americans are drowning in debt!* *walmart earnings show consumers are struggling—the little guy is getting crushed* *big bets on vix calls* *warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway is sitting on record cash* \*\*some of the above are probably less relevant than they were when i drafted the list 12 days ago. i've been of the opinion that buying of this size has been meaningful. i've read all the counter-arguments to that stance and am still not super convinced my interpretation is off. lower. not financial advice.
18 years of options **long post tl;dr:** save aggressively, learn options deeply, remember options themselves have no edge, your process defines your outcome, and adaptability wins. i’ve been active here for about 5 years. i make it a point to engage because i remember being the new trader, convinced that trading could change my life. this post is aimed at beginners and early intermediates (<5 years in the market). these are five core lessons that meaningfully changed my trading trajectory. **1. saving is your highest leverage early-game move.** saving $500 in a $5k account is a 10% “return.” you only get this kind of impact when your account is small (think “newbie gains” in the gym). that same $500 in a $1m account is 0.05%. maximize it while you can. while building savings, you’re also choosing your trading path. you don’t need it fully mapped out, but if your goal is “max return for minimal effort,” odds are overwhelming you’ll fail. you’d be better off dca’ing and maybe selling covered calls at a ratio that doesn’t cap upside. even if options don’t become your specialty (which is statistically likely), the process will teach you decision-making, risk, and discipline—if you don’t blow up the account. **2. forget “target returns.” focus on learning.** new traders obsess over returns and which “options” will get them there. it’s backwards. playing basketball for three months then declaring “i’ll score 50 in the nba tonight” is delusional. for your first years, anything above zero is a gift. learn the craft. a shallow understanding of delta is useless. a “basic” grasp of the greeks isn’t enough. buying leaps because ivp is low shows you missed the volatility surface entirely. a fixed bias toward buying or selling will cost you. market conditions will favor both at different times. **3. options have no inherent edge—profit mechanisms do.** options are just a security type, with added nuance. they let you build precise positions to match your thesis, but the money comes from exploiting **profit mechanisms**—market effects that can be monetized—not from the fact you’re trading options. momentum, drift, breakouts, risk premia, dividend capture... these are where the edges are. whether you sell a put or buy a call, if the underlying goes down, you lose. study both options mechanics and profit mechanisms in parallel. **4. process = outcome.** a lazy process produces lazy results. my turning point came after my largest portfolio loss, when i stopped, evaluated everything, and built a written trading plan and detailed log. the act of creating them was as valuable as the tools themselves. i realized i’d been winging far more than i thought. my recommendation: start a trading plan (google doc or notion) and a trading log (google sheets/excel) immediately. track everything. the insights compound over time. **5. adaptability is your survival skill.** success in options comes from analyzing profit mechanisms, knowing which regimes they thrive in, understanding their behavior, and then overlaying strategies that best capture them. static strategies die in changing markets. **6. slow is smooth, smooth is fast.** we start trading with the goal of making as much money as fast as we can. the irony is the overwhelming majority of cases will end in complete loss of the account. if we can embrace the roadmap of learning to trade and maintain realistic expectations, you really can make a lot of money trading. there is no shortcutting the learning process. **7. plan your time.** it's easy to spend a bunch of time bouncing all around. as a trader, there are (3) broad skill areas to focus on: behavioral psychology (your own); market fundamentals (how they work, basic math and stats, deep understanding of options behavior, etc); process improvement (effective processes and feedback loops are important). i would spend the first 6 months to a year not trading anything live but paper trading and allowing myself to bounce around and learn whatever i can. as i'm doing that, i would track a short list of ideas that might be worth re-visiting later. what's inefficient is deciding to go super far in detail on things without adequate context built. **bottom line:** trading options at a professional level as a retail trader is absolutely possible—but only with deliberate effort. most people are trying to extract maximum reward for minimum work. that’s fine—buy and hold w/ dca is exactly that. but if you choose the trading path, i urge you to embrace the work. you effectively need to complete a self directed dual undergrad with a six sigma "belt". this takes time - give yourself some slack but stay focused. good luck out there!
set out a goal to double $1000 10 times to reach $1m this year. $1000 $2000 $4000 (currently sitting at ~$6000ish holding 7 nvda calls $142. march 21 expiration) $8000 $16000 $32000 $64000 $128000 $256000 $512000 $1,024,000 hoping nvda runs up until earnings. would break $8000 if it reaches $145 next week any recommendations on what the next trade should be?
i lost 20k in options in the past 3 months i’m 25 years old and i lost 20k in options. this is 20% of my net worth and a large percentage of my savings. the only reason i kept trading options for so long is because i wanted to get the money i lost back. i feel like such an idiot. this despair, self-hatred, and depression i feel is ruining my life. it’s leaking into other areas of my life including my work, realtionship, and my friendships. i have changed as a person. now i feel so irritable and i have a much more negative attitude in life. i wish i never got into options. i would give anything to go back in time. i would really appreciate all and any advice. i’ve never dealt with an issue close to this and never thought in a million years i would be this stupid. fyi: my net worth estimate includes my car, 401k, roth ira, and cash. currently i have about 5k in cash.
i made a huge mistake and lost decades of life saving, i need help. my life is done for. i got to know index future at the start of the year, started buying mnq, bought it all the way down till early apr. and panic sold all at the bottom. lost close to a million which 80 percent is life saving, the rest was profit. now it is rising back up. i am devastated. every single day is a nightmare. i cant possibly build up that amount of money anymore in my life. my life is done for. i still have a day job, but i cant focus on it anymore. every single moment im cursing myself for my stupidity. why this has to happen to me. could any kind soul pls offer me some suggestions.
trading for primary income - monthly ama hey everyone, setting up this month's session continuing the goal of helping newer traders as best as i can. *some general market thoughts as a primer:* * we're seeing a general uptick in volatility across the board with clustering occurring at elevated levels * remember, the average bear market is around 298 days and so far, we're just now entering correction territory * we're still seeing broad sector rotation with small pockets of relative strength (albeit weak) in things like energy, staples (recently falling off heavy), utilities, and healthcare (also recently selling off * i'm leaning more heavily into the speculative allocation of my portfolio to drive positive returns while my core allocation of covered strangles in leveraged equity etfs and bitcoin (all obviously down). primary sources have been short-term directional plays (my holding timeframe has shortened to \~2weeks, following historic norms during market rotations). bullish directional breakouts and pead has slowed to a minor part of my book. i've also expanded my equity variance risk premium strategies via variations of 0, 1, and 3dte spx strategies along with earnings plays. with volatility remaining elevated, i'm running a mix of long and short premium strategies with a tilt towards short premium - particularly for mean reversion ideas on the put side. * ytd performance sits at +20.1% roc. this is far ahead of my floor target return which means i remain more selective on the trades i choose to take. **for context on who i am**, my name is erik. i'm a marine vet and options trading is my primary income source. i started trading in 2007 while in high school and wrapped up my 18th full year of trading last year. i maintain just over a 30% cagr for that timeframe, with my last two years being anomalies. 2023 was hands down my best year ever. removing these two data points, my cagr is mid 20%'s. i've had two negative years, my first two trading, both were single digits. [risk manager not giving af about what the market is doing]( * i've never prioritized maximizing my returns and instead focused on achieving consistent returns. i grew up with a low income single mother, who was a occupational therapist contractor for mentally handicapped kids, in a public school district. we always struggled with money and i knew my mom didn't have a retirement plan so i felt i needed to figure out a way to help. i became absolutely engrossed with trading and have easily spent over 35,000 hours on the skill set over my trading career. i have an obsessive personality and was fortunately able to direct it to something constructive. * i built my original trading principal from working. i focused on jobs that paid by the job vs by the hour so i could work quickly and take more work. i split wood, moved shale, sold christmas trees, maintained a bowling alley, etc. i scaled as my capital grew, during college (i earned a marine corps scholarship, no change i would've afforded it otherwise) i bought broken cars, fixed, and sold them. flipped motorcycles, etc. in my mid-20's i got into residential real estate. late 20's i spread into commercial real estate. i'm currently 33 (turn 34 next month). * i view wealth development as (3) key levers: savings rate (as a percent of income), investing, and income growth. we cannot purely save our way to wealth. we need to compound and the fastest way to accelerate compounding is to feed it more capital. in the beginning, our savings rate matters far more than our returns. then, as the account scales, our returns matter far more than additional savings. most of us get into trading thinking it will be fast easy money - this is the polar opposite of reality. however, trading for primary income is entirely achievable for those willing to put in the effort. **why i do this.** there are two primary reasons why i do this. 1. the first stems from a deep gratitude i feel for a high school jrotc instructor who introduced me to the concept of investing. it's because of him, that i went to the library to learn about investing. it's because of him i quickly spread into derivatives. it's because of him i was able to retire my mother and ensure i was in a position to not just take care of her but enjoy a comfortable life. without him and the knowledge he shared with me, i would be on literally, an entirely different trajectory. 2. the second stems from my passion for teaching and helping other people. growing up with limited and unreliable presence from my dad, family friends used to take my brother and i to do things. it's through this exposure that i learned to appreciate how incredible of an opportunity it is to "be raised by a village". i learned to learn from everyone and feel we all should adopt this general approach to help others where possible. 3. bonus why - i am perpetually fascinated by markets and genuinely enjoy them and the trading skillset. it's fun to chat about it and explore ideas. **i've made a series of posts in the community to help others create their own way. i will link to several of them below for your reference and to try and make the ama productive vs repeating things i've already shared.** 1. **trading options for a living** 1. provides a high level overview of my trading approach 2. [ 2. **stop wandering aimlessly** 1. offers a general learning syllabus for new options traders 2. [ 3. **failure rate of options traders - 3 causes** 1. summarizes the common sources of trader failure i've observed over my time trading 2. [ looking forward to a fun conversation and hope i can share some useful information. >hey everyone - hope the conversations are useful. i'll till go through new comments as the pop up but i need to run. great chatting and wish you all the best! > >remember, trading is challenging but for those that embrace the challenge and build the skillset it can massively change the trajectory of your life.
for those who lost on puts(same as me) writing this to let u know revenge trading is never good, turn of the phone and go do something else for the day. the puts set up many no doubt had was good on paper but it was not possible to predict 🥭. understand this you can have a bad day, you can have a bad week. doesn’t mean you are fuked or cooked. walk away and do not revenge trade
i sold a cash secured put on nvda the day before it crashed 20% i sold a $135 csp 30 days out for $200 at about a 0.25 delta, and now that csp is worth 1700. how screwed am i, and what do i do from here?

results after 1 month auto-trading options (~$150k account) results recap after my first full month bot trading options with live accounts - approximately 7% return on allocated capital. ive been options trading manually for over 5 years and have run many paper trade bots. i finally decided to go hard with live accounts on strategies that paper traded very well. primary strategies are iron condors on sp index sectors, orb iron butterflies (1dte), orb calls/puts depending on direction of breakout on qqq. i try to stay delta neutral on the non orb strategies currently about $150k allocated to these bots but not all are currently trading due to low iv environment. so far very happy with results and in september i hope to increase return on risk closer to 20%. im fine if win rate drops to get there as my goal return on risk is 25%. happy to answer questions or share more specific analytics
trump teases a "very very big announcement" for thurs/fri/mon a "very, very, very big announcement, like, as big as it gets". says they'll announce thurs/fri/mon probably. hush hush on details but says it will be "very **positive**... one of the most important announcements made in many years." if we assume a 5% gain in spy by tuesday, there's an 18:1 r:r call out there: any ideas? what it could be? source: [
i've cleared over $70k in my first year using the "wheel". i'm newer (just started in january 2025) to selling/buying options. i’m looking for solid communities (discord, reddit, etc.) where people actively share ideas for wheel strategy stocks and options setups. for context, i run a few different options strategies across accounts: * 0dte with ibkr * wheel strategy with fidelity in 2025, i allocated $100,000 specifically to selling cash-secured puts and covered calls. so far, that account is up \~$73k in gains. my primary tickers this year have been: smci, sym, fig, qs, oklo i usually trade in lots of 5–10 contracts, sell 1–2 weeks out (rarely 3 weeks unless liquidity is limited like with fig), and aim for about \~2% premium per cycle. some gains obviously had luck involved — for example, i got assigned on sym, then caught a 20% spike the following week and exited for about a $10k gain. that said, the system overall has been consistent. where i struggle is idea flow. i’m always rotating in and out of wheel names based on price comfort and iv. for example, when oklo ran up near $140, i stopped selling options on it and rotated into fig instead, but now oklo is back on the table. i don’t currently have a strong group of traders or friends who actively: * share wheel-friendly tickers * track weekly/monthly rotational plays * discuss iv vs risk vs assignment probability so i’m hoping to find: * active discords * subreddits * private groups * or even smaller idea-sharing circles if you’ve had good experiences with any wheel-focused or income-option communities, i’d really appreciate recommendations.
the real reason most new options traders blow up their accounts we’ve all seen the posts: “lost my life savings on tsla calls” or “down 95% on spy puts, how do i recover?” the comments always focus on the same things: “you didn’t understand the greeks!” “you traded weeklies like an idiot!” “you held through earnings!” but here’s the truth: even traders who understand all the technical aspects of options blow up accounts. why? because the real killer isn’t ignorance of how options work. it’s psychological detachment from money. when you deposit cash into a brokerage account, it stops feeling like real money. it transforms into numbers on a screen. trading becomes a video game. and in video games, you take risks you’d never take in real life. the traders who survive aren’t necessarily the ones with the best strategies. they’re the ones who never lose this truth.
trader banks $8m on their $8m bet on $vix c24 from 3 weeks ago, with 33% left running. [17 days ago, i posted about how $8m worth of vix 24/25 calls ]( bought over the course of three days. that day, i posted one of my first yt shorts saying this had parallels between what we saw in the first carry trade shake-out in august 2024 (massive calls were bought in mid-july at relatively same order of magnitude). this call/these calls were effectively the top. [115,000ish contracts bought at $0.75ish at the vix c24, feb 19.]( it looks like that trader has taken *some* off the table (67% of the contracts, sold at a 180% profit). cleared $8m in gains and still has 33% of their position running. [77,000ish contracts sold at $2.10ish, march 7-8]( [a week later, i posted about how the c60/65/70/75 were being bought in size.]( those were filled at less than 0.45. i argued that this was a trader betting on more pain ahead. the market tanked another 3% since. [today, these are marked at break-even\(ish\). but we did have a big vix vacuum on friday and before that these perceived lotto ticket\/hedges were up anywhere from 10-15%]( point being, though some counter-argued saying that these could be hedges against massive huge aum, i am **still of the opinion that someone out there knew that the market was going to be sell-off to a degre**e. since then, all major indices have reverted back to the 200d ma. puts have paid off. [pain.]( hard to say what comes next. buying puts at these levels at elevated volatility means you’re risking more to make less (insurance/puts are expensive), even if you’re directionally right. personally, i think we’re at the beginning of a deflationary cycle as evidenced by things like $wmt, $cost earnings showing consumer weakness, oil and $iwm has gotten bodied and job market is softening, to name a few. “the economy is fine”, says jpow, well – it looks pretty fucking far from fine. $tlt calls and the index itself is now my main play. we saw some aggressive $tlt action last week, and iv is still relatively low. trump may not be able to force the fed’s hand, but his tariff flip-flopping and public sector job cuts could shake up markets. yes, tariffs are inflationary, but the rapid policy shifts could create short-term deflationary pressure—leading investors to a *flight to quality* in treasuries. [big money moving silent on the options chain in the tlt]( also, if rates don’t go lower. we’re fucked. wild times. tl:dr – * trader who bet on volatility (feb 19) effectively called the top (feb 20). market has been in shambles since, but betting on more downside is very expensive. * the stock market is currently at a key technical level (200ma), and these are key levels to watch in the next week. * the bond market is all over the place, but the economy is showing signs of weakness and i suspect rates should head lower. active on yt/x not financial advice. edit: [deflation?](
gambling + luck = gain thanks to $unh $58k the timing of the entry was precise, capitalizing on the short-term trend of the buy unh's current share price is $311.40, but the option breakeven point is $315.09 this suggests that most of the current profits are coming from the increase in implied volatility (iv) and the low-cost advantage of buying the stock my strategy: don't want to take the risk of a short-term pullback or sideways movement in the underlying satisfied with current returns and not greedy have reached my personal pre-set target for this operation
2024: 20k—>70k (+248.17% ) i started this account beginning of the year to do a 20k->1 million challenge* this has been a massive year for me. first off, i’m new to reddit i had no idea about this community but i’m interested to in getting involved. some background: i’m a long time poker player and i found trading contained similar principles-allowed me to adapt quickly and i’ve been trading for the past 10 years.* i just wanted to share my account and my strategy of what got me 268% ytd. what attributed most to my gains was share appreciation, not premiums. my largest holdings are $hood and $tsll, and i also traded $nvdl, $hims, $mara, and recently a little bit of $mstx. heres a break down of capital appreciation only: +$20,925 hood +$12,942 tsll +$8,681 bitx this account saw as high as 90k at a +300% return but came back down. i recognize this is an incredible bull market and don’t expect returns like this every year, but i just took what the market gave me 🤷‍ i wheel into stocks attempting to amass shares, then i sell covered calls, where if i’m breached i roll and roll and roll. for my strategy it’s important to see the long term vision. the vision is to make your account worth more. all i’m doing is picking a stock that’ll be higher in 10 years, and managing the math as it goes up and down in the mean time. obviously with this crazy run up, my covered calls got destroyed...so i rolled and rolled and rolled. starting in march it looks like i’ll start getting my shares back. if we have a less than crazy market. i should be able to bring in ~1000 a week on covered calls. just thought i share the performance! let me know your thoughts.
spx options changed my life well, i gave advice last time and it got $#!t on. but that’s okay. ill try and be a little more detailed and will probably get shizzed on again. honestly just got some messages about more in depth info so i’d figure id share some more. what i typically do, and has worked for me for the last couple years: wait til about 9:30-10am cst (my time zone) identify trend identify support/resistance zones identify what spx is respecting as far as ema’s, and in which time frame. i usually look at 5/15min to identify patterns and ema trends, and use 1min or even 30 sec time frames for entry. (i chart on webull and buy on robinhood) here’s the caveat: it won’t always work. i buy one contract itm or close to itm, 0dte. i just try and be right more than i’m wrong. don’t get into the market with a preplan. look at the trend and trade with the trend. never against it. “stocks can’t just keep going up” are exactly how face ripping rallies happen because shorts have to cover. this market is in unprecedented times. you can’t just buy stocks based of valuations anymore, its not 1990. just saying. i have a set plan, max pain, or where i believe the last support is. if it fails, it fails i sell out and wait for the next opportunity. i sometimes start the morning down $1000 but after a couple trades, im up again. i don’t hold more than 5-10 minutes at the most. this is not a race, take your time let the plays come to you. overtime i almost have a “feel” for spx movements and price action. i can tell low volume days and when its strong support or weak resistance based of candle movements etc. i sometimes use spy to see different perspectives because the support/resistance zones are different, as well as emas. dont follow anyone else’s trades. find what works for you, and follow your rules. about the dip in my account- yeah, got caught in tsll a little early on a big dip. i averaged down. it’s okay, obviously my account survived and im still up. over 50% the last 4 months to be exact. now, with that money i invest into stocks i believe in longterm. tsll and msty for example. you can hate it all you want, im young and risking money is not new to me. i believe in tesla longterm, i believe in btc longterm. i don’t do this full time, yet. just a blue collar guy trying to make it to the next day. also, stocks don’t care about politics. leave that stuff elsewhere. lol
0dte spy options well i discovered spy options, turned 400 in 21000 in a week. turned 21000 into 80 dollars in 3 days
10k of loaned money tldr: i (26) was loaned 10k with a 6 month term by a mentor who wanted to see the result. been trading since about 2015, mostly boring dollar cost average. i dabbled in the dark arts from time to time but never really felt confident enough to want to trade options. the past few years i’ve really dove in and learned as much as i could. traded options with a small account for a year didn’t do too bad blew it up a few times but learned a lot. during this year i was offered a an opportunity to see what i could do with 10k and 6 months. split profit (if any) down the middle 50/50. i was told it would be a learning experience and to set a goal before i started and create a plan to achieve my goal. i set a lofty goal of 10k profit 100% gain from what i started with haha. we had meetings scheduled every 2 weeks to go over my picks and i would have to create a presentation and case for my argument. it’s been 3 months and i’ve put and end to our agreement and cashing out after meeting my goal. this experience has been positive and eye opening. i can now use the money i earned to buy my girlfriend a ring. i’ll be back to trading soon but for now i’m soaking in a win. i want to thank pm, ltbr, nbis, and my baby grrr. i also want to say deepseek sucks but thanks for that market over reaction.
i am a genius i bought 1500 bucks’ worth of 4/17 nvda calls on monday with a $111 strike price. today i sold for a ~100 dollar profit. then the market took a big red shit and i patted myself on the back for having such outstanding risk management that i nearly lost 1500 bucks to turn a 100 dollar profit stay winning kings
im buying 2.7 year calls on google bc its undervalued ***google leap 160 strike exp dec 17, 2027, 995 days till exp*** with big tech taking a good dip recently, i have been looking at option plays and think an atm leap has a good shot of making money. google is an extremely profitable company with major businesses such as search and advertising, cloud computing and enterprise services, youtube, google maps, the google office suite, gemini, waymo, and i could go on. google is facing some headwinds with lawsuits concerning divesting chrome, but other than that, the market continues to underestimate the strength of the business as a whole. a lot of people also think that llms will replace search, but with these llms being out for years, we haven't seen a decline in google search revenue. at the same time, google is diversifying its revenue to be less dependent on search. **with all that being said, i think google should be worth at least 210 per share and currently sits at 164** the reason why i chose an expiration so long is because i'm a relatively conservative investor and like to have as much time as possible for my thesis to play out. i would be interested to hear what others think about this position thanks!
gme down 10% after buying 4,700 btc... but iv is juiced. gme just dropped the news that they bought 4,700 bitcoin today. no price disclosed, no explanation, just vibes. market didn’t love it and the stock dumped \~10% intraday (fake price action). but here’s the thing... iv is still super elevated and premiums are thick. **what we're seeing right now:** price: down 10% today net options sentiment: 95 (lots of bullish options flow leading into today) social sentiment: 88 (people are buzzing again) short pressure: 65 technical score: 50 (after today's drop, kind of just wobbling) this kind of setup is kinda ideal for collecting spicy premium. stock dumped, but people are still paying big bucks for protection or moonshot calls. chart - [prospero.ai]( **not saying what i’m doing, but general thought process:** selling csps a bit below current price = paid to maybe own gme cheaper covered calls if you’ve been holding = collect rent while it chops maybe even spreads if you wanna cap risk and still nibble on iv price action from the last week has iv jacked... let the iv cool off and premiums melt. **food for thought:** is gme’s bitcoin buy actually bullish long-term? anyone else think this might end in an iv crush once the hype fades?
$36 into $3000 bought this on a random callout i saw on monday afternoon, took a look at the chart and thought that it looked good. didn’t think too much and decided to get 3 contracts since i’ve used up all my bp from daytrading some spy contracts earlier. woke up this morning and got the biggest surprise i’ve ever found. caught the move of a lifetime. biggest % gain easily in my past couple years of trading. looking to make back some of the losses from my previous post. cutting down risk and focusing on consistency. gains like these really help though.
pov: you finally figured it out after trading for approximately 6 years i have come to realize a couple things. #1 if you’re looking to build up cash, trade spy/spx options, never hold overnight, and learn a strategy for entry/exits. #2 use that cash to invest in stocks you believe in for longterm investments #3 nobody can time a bottom or top. nobody else’s strategy will work for you. following someone else’s trades is a terrible idea #4 learn to feel the market and interpret the patterns, movements and directions of stocks in a way that makes sense to you. at the end of the day, timing with options are important, but realize that you can never fully time the best entry point so it’s okay to hold through some pain. #5 know an exit time and execute regardless of how you “feel” #6 never give up #7 wait til a trend is formed before placing a trade. i wait til after 0900-0930 typically. #8 don’t force anything. the trades will come, stick with the trend and stick to your rules. those are just words of advice i wish someone told me before i figured it out. i have reset my account a couple of times after becoming profitable, blown up a couple of accounts, learned hard expensive lessons, and really just felt stupid at times. but im finally making it. aim to make money regardless of the % or $ amount, don’t get greedy, don’t gamble. 90% of the stock market is controlling your fomo. also, don’t pay for any bs subscribing stock market discord scam. don’t listen to twitter gurus. listen and learn but don’t blindly follow. i use twitter(x) soley for news and information. never once have i followed a trade and been successful from someone on twitter. just my 2c. have a goodnight🤙
guy loses $116,600 after cboe busts his trade this guy had a call spread on spx. he closed it one leg at a time but the cboe busted his short close and he was on the hook for $116,600. it happened when the markets skyrocketed after trump announced the 90 day extension on tariffs. probably the market maker called the cboe and complained.

vix has dropped. time to buy puts if you're bearish edit: i'm talking about puts on spy / qqq or other stocks, not on vix the market is up today, but check the vix. also, check the low volume on spy. it is struggling to go up. if you are bearish about all this long term, it may be time to buy some puts. personally, i feel this is a bull trap, and i bought spy 500p jun 20th expiry. do your own research, and play accordingly. good luck!
i'm making $500 per week with options with $100,000. am i most likely going to wipe out my account? i pick a deep otm put option, and i write 10 contracts for $0.50, i get $500 premium. i've been doing this since october 2024 and i never got assigned, there was only 2 times i had to roll, and 2 more times i had to get out at breakeven but no losses. so far it's been more than a half a year i've been doing this, and i keep it up it will be a 26% return on investment. can this go horribly wrong? my p&l is also my long-term investments combined, but these options have contributed a big chunk of my profits.
1 in 6 tastytrade customers go to zero tom sosnoff just dropped a stat in the compound interview that floored me: 16% of tastytrade customers blow up their accounts. think about that. almost 1 in 6 people who come in full of excitement... end up at zero. and it's only because of size. that's the one thing that kills even the geniuses in this business. this is exactly why you must trade small and always have a black swan hedge running in the background. most traders obsess over daily pnl, but the pros obsess over staying alive long enough to let compounding do its job. i can't stress this enough: you don't blow up because you're dumb. you blow up because you think you're invincible, and the market always punishes that. how many of you here are actually running a black swan hedge vs. just "trading small"?
bought 30k worth of qqq leaps 25m here. huge believer of lifecycle investing and using leverage while one is young. also, i was fortunate to get a job in the investment industry after graduating and learn a ton about derivatives and portfolio management. not there anymore, as i appreciate having work-life balance. i basically liquidated all my portfolio after trump's liberation day to go (almost) all in qqq leaps. i bought some of them on thursday while the market was down -15% from ath, and then i averaged down again on friday when the drawdown was -18%. i know it can go much lower, so i will continue adding to my position every month until december, doing kind of dca but with leaps. also, after holding them for 1 year i will roll them one year further. this way leaps just work as a stock-replacement strategy, but with huge leverage and without having to worry about expiration. i was too young to invest during the 2008 crash. i did not have money during the 2020 covid crash. this is my moment to take risks. everything sounds scary. guess what? companies will continue to innovate. tariffs will go away. technology will continue to disrupt the world and profit margins will expand again. by the way, i'm not worried about iv. it is extremely high for short-term options; not that much for leaps. also, a good thing about leaps is that you can't get margin called. positions: 1x qqq dec 18 2026 390 call 1x qqq dec 18 2026 430 call 1x qqq dec 18 2026 440 call 1x qqq dec 18 2026 460 call wish me luck. no risk, no gain. edit: i'm seeing some people saying that i'm early. the truth is that nobody knows. market timing does not work. holding for years does. that's why i'm planning to roll indefinitely. and if we do have a recession, this free fall has already priced in some of it, if not everything. the stock market is a machine of anticipating events before they actually happen, so waiting until we hit recession might be too late. also, iv is very high for short term options but leaps have not been affected that much. if stocks go up, iv is the last of my worries. and if i'm wrong, i accept it. i can take the risk now. i will not be able to take it after i get married and have kids in the next decade. now is the moment to do it.
trading options for a living tl;dr: trading options for a living works but looks a lot different than i, and likely you originally thought it would. big post - skip if you don’t feel like reading. ah the dream. trading options for a living. the reality is the dream looks incredibly different than the first illusion we all see. fast easy money, laptop powered travel trading, private jets etc. the reality as i’ve learned over the last 18 years of trading is you can make an incredible amount of money doing this. however, it’s just like any other job it requires a significant effort to do well. trading amplifies things as there’s no structure and you are your own boss. i’m writing this post to hopefully provide a dose of reality and context to ideally set a solid foundation for others to have a better shot at succeeding. below are a few misconceptions i had and how i would suggest thinking about them instead. 1. get really good at a strategy and use that to make money. this led to difficulties finding opportunities in market conditions that didn’t favor the strategy. the fix - i adopted a set of strategies that allow me to find opportunities in literally every market condition. i maintain a long beta position through covered strangles in index etfs (including leveraged etfs, not so much to make more risk but actually to maintain the same exposure but reduce capital outlay to permit scaling during drawdowns). i trade opportunistic directional ideas via ratio call and put diagonals (including the single legs). i trade volatility via straddles, strangles, & combos. through this, i access several risk premiums and all market direction combinations. 2. sell options for income. this is fine but mentally constraining for no reason at all. the reality is whatever makes money can be used for income. i have no idea why i was so set on selling options for income, it seemed to make so much sense - essentially paying yourself with credits but it truly is nonsensical. the credits we receive are tied to open positions that eventually need to reconcile. narrow thinking on my part. the fix - focus on trading approaches that you find success with, not colloquial perceptions of what an approach is. 3. need $10k this month? just make $10k! because most of us start off poor, we have a natural hand to mouth tendency. however, in trading for a living this is probably the worst possible idea on earth. what if you have a bad month? what if there’s a natural disaster and the power is out for a week? you have an accident? this approach leaves zero margin for error and a corresponding likelihood of success. the fix - robustness matters and will massively drive up probability of success. i saved 2 padded years of expenses before feeling comfortable trading for primary income. rather than needing to make this months money this month, i would spend this months money and then plus back up the reserve. this way, i would have 2 full years of expenses covered without doing anything. my idea was i should be able to figure just about anything out in that timeframe. now, as the accounts have grown, i don’t really track it this way anymore but in the beginning i found that approach really successful. so yes, trading options for your primary income is doable. yes you can travel the world. however, if you want it to actually work you need to treat it professionally, this includes the tremendous amount of effort to build the skillset. the overwhelming majority of traders love the idea of the benefits of being a professional trader but do not want to do much of the actual work - yet wonder why the failure rate is so high. trading for a living takes another shape than trading as a side hobby. do you have a written trading plan? do you have a trading log you audit regularly to optimize your performance? have you completed comprehensive financial roadmapping? are you actively and methodically testing strategy variations and researching new profit mechanisms? i fortunately found i’m obsessed and truly passionate about markets early on, so it overlapped well (just as other people are able to find their passion is any other job). if you are able to learn to love the process, even the ugly parts (which are often the most transformative) you will find the “work” is actually incredibly satisfying aside from the financial rewards. good luck out there.
betting on executive manipulation tomorrow yesterday's triumph of narrative over foundations taught me an important lesson about the market: it doesn't matter what reality says. so long as any piece of good news is expressed by a sufficiently loud mouth, the overall trend of the real economy is immaterial to the day-to-day swings of the market. it matters in the long-term, but not the short--and short is where the greatest risks/rewards live. tomorrow, jpm and wfc will announce their quarterly earnings, with eps and revenue *generally* expected by analysts to be favorable relative to q1 2024. everyone also expects remarks about tariffs being bad for the future, which will not matter because it's already common knowledge and has already been priced in. i fully expect a morning post from truthsocial's largest account during or before market opening. the post will exaggerate the strength of the financial system in light of these reports and urge everyone to invest in the economy; hints about impending trade deals with tariffed countries will also be present. this will send the bulls into a frenzy, which we should capitalize on with short-term calls on spy, jpm, wfc, and the tech giants. for spy specifically, i'll go just otm relative to where the market opens, which will certainly be higher than today's closing position. i don't know whether a stampede comparable to wednesday's will materialize, but i am fairly certain that bullish activity will happen. after the weekend passes, and the world sobers up a bit, the market will resume its rightfully bearish trend. that will be the time to apply puts on spy, again otm, though obviously longer-lived (say, a week). what do you guys think?
tsla insanity pays my bills owning tsla stock? too risky for me. trading tsla options? absolutely chaotic, but surprisingly profitable. i’ve been sticking to short calls and put spreads, here’s why i like it: * high volatility rn = juicy premiums. * musk never fails to deliver some bs, the public never fails to overreact i can't get enough of this (these results are per 10 contracts, while i usually trade 3-4. generally, sell delta is around 0.30, buy delta is 0.05). update: yes, these trades come from an alerts service. and? i still executed them with my own money, taking on the risk myself
no one knows anything... over the past two weeks : china increase tariffs, market went up. trump increased tariffs, market went up. rumours came out that trump might ease down on tariffs but hasn’t done anything, market went up 3 days passed and still no official deal or agreement with china, market went up. i bought puts thinking a fall is going to happen because no real agreement is made.. lost. tesla was supposed to crash, it didn’t.
the exact strategy i'd use if i had to start over with $5k. everything is noise including price. the only thing which matters is market direction. only buy leaps when fear and greed index tanks to 25 or below. (leaps with 70+ delta ideally of high beta companies.) only sell leaps when fear and greed index pushes 65-75. whether prices keep running afterwards it's all noise. the only thing which matters is participation in market direction. when vix spikes take positions. when vix floors sell positions. the hard part is being patient. the easy part is buying. the hard part is selling. waiting as market keeps pumping, feeling missing out because prices are moving. prices are actually irrelevant. underlying is simply a vehicle with greater or lesser returns of market participation. the goal is to participate in market booms, avoid market dumps, and actually compound gains. sold entire port two days ago now in sgov, awaiting gdp on 30th, tariff announcements and fomc meeting. if none of these events tank the market, i'll still sit out waiting for fear and greed index to tank. last 3 months locked in 90% return. am on the sidelines now awaiting fgi to dump to feel safe. what prices do is irrelevant. what matters is market participation, avoid the next dump, capture most of the run, and compound gains into good deals next cycle. the ticker, price action, everything is all noise. we need ticker with strong earning's report to serve as the underlying which will have strong relative strength vs the market or move more aggressively than the market when prices rebound. we want to buy when fear is running rampant, vix has spiked, so we get the best deals possible. then use leverage to buy max dates leaps awaiting market recovery. the hard part is selling knowing market will keep running more time. however, the goal is market participation during the right time periods, everything else is just noise. fear and greed index + max date leaps makes it a long term high win success rate compounding game.
uncomfortable truth of trading options for income big post and i suck at writing. proceed at your own risk. tl;dr: trading for income is widely misunderstood. you need more money than you think. you need to plan more realistically than you do. there isn’t an easy approach that always works and just needs 4 nanoseconds per week. you need enough experience and strategies to adapt to changing markets. all that nonsense aside, it’s otherwise pretty simple. you just need some basic adjustments to drastically increase viability. one of the neat aspects of options is they’re extremely flexible. we can build positions to accomplish a wide array of objectives. a common use cases is trading options for income. as widely discussed as it is, it’s incredible how much bad information there is regarding it. this post is to debunk some of these misconceptions to prevent improper planning and provide practical advice. i just wrapped my 18th year of trading, it’s how i initial built wealth and my primary income source. first, trading for “income” doesn’t mean selling premium. this is a common default since short premium strategies collect premium up front, this improperly gets lumped into income. the concept of trading for income is more about guiding methodology than approach. when someone is trading for income, this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re trading a specific strategy. it means they’re employing their portfolio to provide steady capital for withdrawal vs leaving the capital in for compounding. income trading deprioritizes maximum growth and prioritizes consistency in returns. the return methods are entirely up to the trader. example, if you like buying options for momentum breakouts and have a proven track record of doing so successfully, this can be an excellent income approach. as you’ll see in the next takeaway, having an approach that gives you space allows you to trade in whatever way is most reliable and consistent for you. this means you don’t need to default to higher probability short premium strategies. if you’re a better directional trader via long options, that’s fine. takeaway 1 - do not box your brain into thinking income trading is a specific type of strategy, it’s not. next is how we build a sustainable approach to generating income. a common misconception is if i need $500 this week that i should go trade and make the $500. this is doomed to fail. when trading for income, one of the most important elements is creating a buffer, imo a minimum of 1 year padded expenses (padded because people notoriously overestimate their competence and underestimate friction. in this context, it means lowballing how much we actually might need). if i want $15k per month, i’m not trying to make $15k this month to spend this month. it means there is at least $180k (+ taxes) plus the principal needed to continue generating the $15k/mo in the account. as i make my $15k, i’m simply topping off my $180k income principal baseline. this is essential because it reduces the overwhelming psychological games that enter when our ass is on the line. remember, spoon to mouth is never a good way to live. takeaway 2 - throw the idea of making the money as you need it as far out as you can, this is a near certain way to fail. finally is planning. one of your key jobs as a trader is remaining adaptable to markets. when you’re trading for income, it’s literally your (and your family’s) livelihood. having a truly robust approach is nonnegotiable. this requires a deep understanding of markets, path, and evolution of markets. it requires the ability to continually innovate your approach to maintain relevant edges. it also requires you realistically planning how much you want to make and how much you need. and yes, “do you think 40% per year is realistic so i can hit my timeline?” is a real question i’ve gotten and i regret to share no it isn’t (and santa isn’t real either). example, if your go to strategy was trading leverage post earnings announcement drift in large cap stocks - this worked well for decades. however, over the last 20 years, the trade has become crowded and produces significantly less alpha. if this was the only thing you do, you’re fucked. having several irons in the fire is important for robustness and longevity - this means maintaining multiple approaches, where some might even be suboptimal, but they provide important strategy diversification. we simply weight what is working the best. side note, premium selling approaches can work well but they’re often over simplified and misevaluated. they can fall into pieces if there’s a strong move against us, where extended durations of rolling options ties up money and at the end, we don’t have much to show for it wrt income. this doesn’t make selling premium for income bad, it simply must be considered and often isn’t because it includes an uncomfortable reality when we want easy simple answers. takeaway 3 - if you truly want to trade for a living, it won’t be accomplished with “this one simple strategy requires just 4 nanoseconds per week to generate $15k/mo income with no risk!” markets will show many different sides that require adaptations. you must plan conservatively if you want to actually have a chance. my trading approach from the onset was designed around consistency in annual returns (reducing drawdowns can significant drive up a cagr and compounding) so realistically it’s required very litle adjustment for me. for others, it might require retooling more aspects which the sooner you start considering, the better. trading isn’t easy but it’s worth it.
don't play the tylenol:autism trump/rfk bet like i did about 1 week ago, wsj reported that tylenol ceo ($kvue) had an emergency meeting with rfk jr. trying to get him not to publish their findings on possible connection of autism with tylenol (which was reported to drop this month). i felt rfk jr. would not change course so looked into how i could play this. turns out i was right about this as trump has just teased the announcement for today i believe? quick research found re: tylenoln/kenvue: * tylenol is only like 10% or so of kvue revenue * $kvue dropping 10% by end of month didn't look super juicy, only about a 1:2.5 rr from puts. * but i wasn't sure if it would actually drop an additional 10% since it had dropped a fair amount already. and a 5% drop would only generate a 33% gain. not enough for me to place a bet so then my big brain thinks, well if people stop using tylenol then what would they turn to instead?? advil right?? i do some quick research on advil. * it's owned by a company caled haleon ($hln) - it's an optionable ticker * advil makes up 60% of $hln sales * the calls have a high spread but the r:r looks gooooood. * i feel like a genius. * i buy * i do some post-purchase research to just confirm my trade/thesis was good and this is where i realize playing $hln calls was a mistake in case anybody else was having the same bright idea as me. 1. the report about tylenol is linking use of tylenol during pregnancy with autism in babies 2. advil already has issues with women using it in pregnancy soooooo not the slam dunk i thought it was. and yeah $hln has not been going up at all and large bid-ask spread made it very hard to exit my position. moral of the story: read a little deeper than the headlines.
greed taught me a very valuable lesson today. so i've been investing in stocks for almost 20 years and decided to learn about options. i started with $25k three months ago and i've consistently made $500 day that i trade on then quit out. it's 2% roi on my initial $25k every day i trade, which isn't every day. that's not much but it's adding up. i made a mistake today and blew up my account by trying to go for more. lesson learned to stop when you've met your goal. even if it's $5 or $100, take the win and shut it down. greed gets you nowhere. i'm basically back to my initial $25k but i'm still motivated and won't be taking any more risks like that. i'm fine with $500 each day i trade. edit: this gained more traction than i thought it would and i need to clerify a lot. i don't day trade every day, only on days i'm confidenet that i can get in and out with $500. my stratagie is to buy 10 well itm weekly calls on spy or qqq on a monday or tuesday. i usually go in wtih about $15,000. it literally takes less than a minute to make $500 (sometimes quite a bit more). then i sell the contract and i'm out. this is money i am comfortable losing, it's not a my main account just my options trial account.
people like this need to be banned immediately brother is claiming that he made 9k->40k in one month. i did the math, he would have to make 4 bps per trade, trading at 10 trades per day for 30 days. since he’s trading iron condors and iron butterflies, unless he’s paying margin in which case he needs to make even more than 5 bps, he’s claiming he’s risking all of his money to make 4 cents per 9k he risks. then he reinvests all the profits (not possible since he’s only pulling 4 cents per trade) on ever trade. with 9k starting, his spread on each leg needs to be 9 or less points, severely limiting profits. if we assume he has a 90% win rate, and each loss only losses 1% of his value, he needs to be making more like 12bps per trade. he’s trading 0dte and 1dte ic and ib. how would you ever hope to capture this kind of profit?
$750-$9000 on 5 spy trades mon-friday i put $750 in webull on monday (debit card deposit) just to trade spy this week, trading strictly off news, momentum, fomc meeting and powell speaking. i made 1 trade a day in and out within an hour or so although i did hold one swing overnight. i came into this willing to lose the $750 and had no emotions over the initial investment. i turned $750 into just under $9000 though i know it was pure luck/timing and the way spy fluctuated last week. this is not a trading strategy just more speculative on trading the news. trades posted in 2nd photo. aloha 🤙
tsla calls finally hit – not rich, but no longer poor bought some tsla calls because: 1. it felt right. 2. elon had been suspiciously quiet. 3. i needed some spice in my portfolio. held longer than i should have, but it printed. not a life-changer, but enough to upgrade dinner from ramen to steak. 🥩 did i understand the greeks? not really. would i do it again? probably. am i smarter now? unlikely. options: tsla [strike]c [expiration] next move: watching from the sidelines and pretending i’m disciplined. thanks for the tendies, elon. see you on mars
$path down 20% and this $500k put trade could potentially 2x tomorrow, potentially insider info. i saw this trade hit the tape this morning and decided to ape into the p9.5 for poops and laughs. [weird.]( **the trade** this trader placed a $500k outlay on $path on very deep otm options, grossly exceeding oi. this far out, this close to expiry, is highly suggestive of strong conviction a specific direction, in pelosi-esque style. [high conviction \/ trader was probably not uncertain]( **fact checking myself.** i stated on the record that [regardless of the outcome i was going to debrief this.]( if in the case i was wrong, this would have been a good lesson on how trades like this could be false positives – i.e., this could have been a hedge on a massive long position. also, iv was super high so if this didn’t move parabolic, iv crush would have wiped a lot of these positions out. [everyone and their mom was basically short this thing]( **having said that, it looks like this played out favorably, for now.** earnings are out (conference call still pending), and $path is down 20% **so far.** i don’t think i’ve seen something re-correct by this order of magnitude overnight, so i’m of the opinion that the upcoming conference call won’t save the price action here. very likely this opens sub-10. guess we’ll see. [down bigly]( doing the back of the envelope math – this trade needs to hit $10.02 to break even. $9.5 would be a relative 2x. $9.30 gives me a 2x. still too early to call. **core hypothesis:** this screams someone front-running the action. something of this size is not normal. i suspect this will play out favorably for this specific outlay. will watch to end the week. interesting stuff, regardless. feels very "someone always knows something"-y. thoughts?
someone sold a 4/17 tsla $440 put today for $15 million premium - isn't that a guaranteed loss? or maybe its part of some sort of more complex option strategy? my understanding is this person would be on the hook to buy tesla shares for $440 at expiration on 4/17 when the stock is currently at $254. why would someone make this trade?
i really give up with options monday puts wasted because trump exempted phones, computers, etc., so the entire s&p/nasdaq will probably rocket to the moon. meanwhile, my friday calls got burned to ashes. this isn't investing—i hate to say it, but it's truly "dumber than a sack of bricks," as elon pointed out.
this market is a clown circus. this market is a clown circus excuse for a market. manipulation at every corner. blatant signs being ignored. and it gets worse every single day. shoutout to my brothers who’re trying to trade through this mess. it is absolutely ridiculous.
trading for primary income - monthly ama hey everyone, i mentioned trying to host a monthly ama to specifically help newer traders as best as i can. i understand how brutal online communities can be (this isn't all bad btw, that brutality is needed and forces people to at least moderately think about things). **for context on who i am**, my name is erik. i'm a marine vet and options trading is my primary income source. i started trading in 2007 while in high school and wrapped up my 18th full year of trading last year. i maintain just over a 30% cagr for that timeframe, with my last two years being anomalies. 2023 was hands down my best year ever. removing these two data points, my cagr is mid 20%'s. i've had two negative years, my first two trading, both were single digits. [my risk management lead]( i've never prioritized maximizing my returns and instead focused on achieving consistent returns. i grew up with a single, low income single mother who was a occupational therapist contractor for mentally handicapped kids, in a public school district. we always struggled with money and i knew my mom didn't have a retirement plan so i felt i needed to figure out a way to help. i became absolutely engrossed with trading and have easily spent over 35,000 hours on the skill set over my trading career. i have an obsessive personality and was fortunately able to direct it to something constructive. i built my original trading principal from working. i focused on jobs that paid by the job vs by the hour so i could work quickly and take more work. i split wood, moved shale, sold christmas trees, maintained a bowling alley, etc. i scaled as my capital grew, during college (i earned a marine corps scholarship, no change i would've afforded it otherwise) i bought broken cars, fixed, and sold them. flipped motorcycles, etc. in my mid-20's i got into residential real estate. late 20's i spread into commercial real estate. i'm currently 33 (turn 34 next month). i view wealth development as (3) key levers: savings rate (as a percent of income), investing, and income growth. we cannot purely save our way to wealth. we need to compound and the fastest way to accelerate compounding is to feed it more capital. in the beginning, our savings rate matters far more than our returns. then, as the account scales, our returns matter far more than additional savings. most of us get into trading thinking it will be fast easy money - this is the polar opposite of reality. however, trading for primary income is entirely achievable for those willing to put in the effort. **why i do this.** there are two primary reasons why i do this. the first stems from a deep gratitude i feel for a high school jrotc instructor who introduced me to the concept of investing. it's because of him, that i went to the library to learn about investing. it's because of him i quickly spread into derivatives. it's because of him i was able to retire my mother and ensure i was in a position to not just take care of her but enjoy a comfortable life. without him and the knowledge he shared with me, i would be on literally, an entirely different trajectory. the second stems from my passion for teaching and helping other people. growing up with limited and unreliable presence from my dad, family friends used to take my brother and i to do things. it's through this exposure to my family and family friends that i learned to appreciate how incredible of an opportunity it is to "be raised by a village". i learned to learn from everyone and feel we all should adopt this general approach to help others where possible. **i've made a series of posts in the community to help others create their own way. i will link to several of them below for your reference and to try and make the ama productive vs repeating things i've already shared.** 1. **trading options for a living** 1. provides a high level overview of my trading approach 2. [ 2. **stop wandering aimlessly** 1. offers a general learning syllabus for new options traders 2. [ 3. **failure rate of options traders - 3 causes** 1. summarizes the common sources of trader failure i've observed over my time trading 2. [ looking forward to a fun conversation and hope i can share some useful information. >hey everyone! spent a little longer than expected but tried to give genuine answers that go beyond the superficial simple responses. i'm trying to do one of these per month so i will plan to do another next and am happy to help however i can. > >enjoy the weekend!
i should quit my job and do this full time... right guys? i admit it. i’m way too emotional for this world. yeah it’s okay because it’s “play money”, but i should just go to thailand instead of watching a screen. it’s way more fun. really though. feel free to roast me. every position i have right now is calls and they are all down 1-7% after hours right now. just started options after about 4 years of holding bags only. i can’t really be mad right because i’m up. but i like the gamble. i work during trading hours and i had about 50 different positions set up. lol. here’s what i learned in the last month of trading: 1. read the news. i’m subscribed to multiple trading publications now and check news at 5am before work. 2. set your stop losses when you enter the position. small loss, big wins. 3. don’t have 50 positions open. like i’m so dumb. even if you could rapid fire close them you won’t time it right. (like i said no stop losses were set) questions: how many positions do you have at one time? should i just study one sector and do a single position a day? i’m trying to aim at $400/day profit.
do not pay for invest with correy options trading course. i got my money back. do not sign up with invest with corey options trading course. he will ask for large sums of money and give little to no value. he and his team will make false promises of 10x returns, 5-10%+ returns and $10k-$20k monthly of guaranteed income when you join. he is a complete liar about his past experience in trading options. he claims to have years of experience in trading without proof. may also be lying to have a bachelors degree in finance. because he had a previous business called "faymus media" and other money makers that failed in the past. he also claimed to go to full sail university, which he never went to. also, correy is likely in the usa illegally. correy will ingnore typical refund requests. but when i threaten to report invest with corey and whop to the ftc, ic3, ice and to the local and new jersey state attorney general through sending emails to their support. i got a call from someone from corey's team days later saying they will agree to refund. it will take a few days to process. i did get my money back. the support will use fake names like "rosh japzon" the one i saw in the support email of the refund. the fact that correy's team gave in when threatening to report and give my money back shows they can get in trouble for what they are doing. the bad thing about correy is he is so good at covering it up and looking sucessful with his stock picks on youtube. that is how people get lured into joining his options trading course. do not sign up with corey.
first and last time doing puts bro started trading 3 months ago and got some bread then lost more. decided yesterday to buy a put on apple stock for a strike price of 171 hit overnight, then market open it dropped and the china retaliated, got some back and was waiting for more. then out of no way he pause tariffs on every one except china lost the whole put.
for all the traders consistently losing in this market i keep seeing so many loss posts here, so here are a few things inexperienced traders need to keep in mind trading this volatile market. there was a recent article that big banks like goldman sachs have trading teams that are raking in massive profits this quarter from retail traders like you. you’re literally going up against hedge funds, market makers, and seasoned pros that know how to trap you, scare you, make you feel fomo, and take your hard-earned money. as someone in the comments said, there are quants with access to order flow data and operating at a higher level that retail traders are not. anyone who trades on pure instinct and emotion is going to get destroyed in this market. you have to be a good technical trader like the pros. the only way is to study charts and learn from smart traders. there’s a ton of free knowledge/analysis on x (i recommend following ripster47, kobeissiletter, masterpandawu, trendspider, cheddarflow, spotgamma, mr_derivatives, and so many others). this market has been very lucrative for technical traders with good fundamentals. people consistently losing might think the orange man and his cabinet are screwing up their amazing trades, but it’s no coincidence that most of the time, news catalysts come out at key areas where price can reject or continue a trend. if you can spot an opportunity to enter a trade, the news catalysts just initiates the potential move that you had already spotted. one of the biggest skills you need is to master support and resistance levels, then you’ll know when to take profit or to enter a trade or cut a losing trade (always keep your losers small). for example, look at today’s price action. the rally topped out at around 5460 on spx. look at that level from the past month - do you see how many times it’s rejected that area?? when it didn’t break through, you should’ve known that there was a good chance it was going to reverse again. and then look at the midday bounce from the lows today at around 1pm et. spx 5412 was another huge level that had to be reclaimed to go higher if you were bullish today. but it stopped literally right below it. once it rejected, you should’ve known there’d be a lot more downside. experienced day traders all made great money on shorting both those levels. too many retail traders right now want to get rich by being lazy and yoloing blindly. you might get lucky a few times, but your massive losses will probably outweigh any lucky wins. you need a system and good risk management. if you don’t have one and you get lucky, then walk away and wait for the next amazing opportunity to get lucky. i was once one of those traders and i got my ass handed to me in 2022 and lost all my lucky gains from the year before. good luck on your journey to getting good at this shit. disclaimer: my main career is completely different and trading is just a hobby that i’ve turned into a good source of income by putting in the hard work. so i’m not an expert at this, just trying to help people who are getting started.

first week of options been investing for a few years but always been afraid of options because of wall street bets and people that think they know better than me swearing to stay away from them. i have an economics and business degree and do my due diligence and research before investing in my stocks. last sunday, i randomly got my adhd burst at about midnight and decided to just research everything i could about options. began the week running covered calls on nvda, yeti, and open. then made some long calls on lesl and yeti. big supporter of yeti and own a pool maintenance company so i’m very familiar with leslie’s. closed out my yeti calls today and lesl movement has helped my call options there but decided i’d keep them open since movement has been mostly upward this week. 1 strategy for lesl is already itm since i purchased monday when it was under 50 cents. feeling excited for what’s to come this year as i turn 30 in september. obviously, i expect a market crash in the near future so i’m not making a habit of playing options consistently nor making huge gambles. i’m a teacher and hate my life so i’m hoping to make solid gains to switch careers after this school year.

new cboe data shows a rise in retail algorithms trading 0dte options! cboe posted a chart recently showcasing the rise of retail algorithmic trading. i think this is fundamentally reshaping options market microstructure, as evidenced by the distinctive volume spikes at predictable intervals throughout the trading day. cboe data reveals clear patterns of non-institutional volume clustering around 10 am, 2 pm, and other key times, which is a telltale sign of basic retail algorithms executing predetermined strategies. my gut says this seems like simple time-based algorithms, momentum chasers, and basic mean reversion bots that retail traders can now access through platforms like python libraries and simplified trading apis. the concentration of this activity likely creates new intraday volatility patterns that experienced options traders can anticipate and exploit. from a more technical perspective, the algorithms may lack the sophistication to account for complex greeks interactions, potentially buying high iv options during panic periods and selling during consolidation phases. weirdly, this may create opportunities for manual traders who understand gamma exposure and can position against these predictable flows. however, it also introduces new risks. the speed of execution means that traditional support and resistance levels can be blown through faster than human traders can react, and the clustering effect means that when these retail algos all trigger simultaneously, they can create flash moves that catch even experienced traders off-guard. i won't be surprised to see market makers adapt by widening spreads during these predictable volume windows. what are your thoughts?

pepsico just hit one of the highest dividend yields in its history and high iv rank i normally don't post about individual stocks, but pepsico ($pep) caught my attention. right now: * dividend yield is around **4.06%**, one of the highest in the company's history * stock has pulled back from \~$190 to \~$130 * 53 straight years of dividend increases * fundamentals are still solid, no obvious collapse in the business for options traders, it gets even more interesting: * **iv rank is 34.5**, which makes options premiums elevated, * this could be a good setup for selling cash-secured puts, or even running the wheel strategy if you want to build a position. i'm sketching out a few trade ideas now, but curious how are others approaching it? would you consider starting a wheel on pep here, selling puts aggressively, or would you stay away given the broader market risks?
i'm curious who came up with 100 shares as 1 contract? for those that don't have sufficient funds to buy 100 shares, why don't they make different increments like 25, 50, etc per contract. i'm just curious because i don't want to plant enough funds to do cash - secure puts or calls for certain stocks that i don't mind buying into.
lost 40k in 2 months – looking for guidance to rebuild i started trading with $80k and lost $40k in just two months. here’s how it went down: • in december, i got caught up in the tesla bull run hype and assumed january would take it to the moon. ended up losing almost $25k on tesla options. • after that, i tried to be more cautious, but still had some small miscellaneous losses. • then i discovered spy 0dte options and made the dumb assumption that if i buy 100 contracts, a $0.10 increase in premium would net me $1k. sounded simple, right? • every time i entered a trade, it felt like the market instantly moved against me. i’d put in $10k to try and make $1k, only to lose $5k-$6k instead. clearly, my risk management was terrible. now, i’m down $40k, which was about 75% of my savings over the past three years. i’m devastated, but not completely broke. i transferred $10k back to my checking account to remove the temptation of revenge trading and left myself with $3k in robinhood, hoping to build it up slowly and properly this time. the truth is, i never had a real strategy—just got influenced by tons of youtube videos and jumped in blindly. i was basically gambling. i want to change that. i want to develop the right mindset, risk management, and a solid trading strategy. if anyone here has gone through something similar and turned things around, i’d really appreciate your insights, tips, or even just some motivation. thanks in advance!
changed up my technique recently and had great success a couple years ago i lost roughly 90% of my options trades. this past month i've got a 100% win rate. i'm aware we're in a bull market so this probably isn't as impressive but here's some important things i learned/did different. 1. market trend analysis: i learned how to identify reversals and buy calls/puts accordingly. rsi is my favorite tool to use. 2. strike price selection: there's a reason further out of the money options are cheap, it's because your chance of profit is considerably lower. buy in the money or as close as you can afford to in the money options as you can to protect yourself from losses. time is your best friend with options, giving yourself further expirations will give you more time to recover from short term price drops. that being said, i did gamble on a few 0dte's just to see if i was analyzing trends right and it worked in my favor. 3. research: i use chatgpt for all my market research. all i do is copy paste some prompts i made and change the ticker symbol and it pulls all the financial data, intrinsic value calculation, catalyst factors for growth, and it even gives me a buy, hold, or sell rating. for example; i learned about mesoblast's (meso) drug going through fda approval from chatgpt. i had it give me information on the subject until i felt confident that they would get approved and i had an understanding of the timeline. 4. taking gains: i watch the market trends and constantly check to see if i'm at the top. i don't really look at the profit anymore, i just focus on the timing of the trade. if i believe there's room for more growth and i have more time until expiration, i'll sell some contracts and hold the rest. i hope this information helps everyone. i'm no expert by any means, but i learned from my past mistakes and wanted to share with you.
saw the market was up 3% this morning so i bought spy puts! bought a 0 dte 520p, now up 470%, and a 6 dte 501p, up 185%. set trailing stops so i can get out if it changes direction too much.

a quick, technical explanation of the "taco" trade the "taco" trade ("trump always chickens out") represents a systematic volatility pattern that creates predictable option pricing inefficiencies. the initial tariff announcement typically drives the vix up 15-25% within an hour, causing massive iv expansion across all strikes, particularly in near-dated options. put options see delta acceleration due to increased gamma exposure near atm strikes, while call premiums get crushed by both directional movement and vega exposure. the subsequent policy reversal creates the opposite effect: vix compression, iv crush on puts, and explosive gamma-driven rallies that benefit call holders who survive the initial theta decay. this pattern creates specific technical opportunities for options traders. 1. long volatility positions (straddles/strangles) benefit from the initial iv spike but must be closed before the reversal to avoid vega collapse. 2. short-dated puts experience extreme gamma risk during the announcement phase, as delta can move from 0.30 to 0.70+ within minutes on atm strikes. 3. the reversal phase often triggers massive gamma squeezes in calls as market makers hedge their short positions, creating explosive upside moves that far exceed what the underlying fundamentals would suggest. 4. theta decay accelerates during these high-iv periods, making timing more critical than directional accuracy. positions that are theoretically correct can still lose money if held through multiple policy cycles using moderately-dated options.
psa: if you see a high gain post and op saying dm them if you need help, it's a scam do not dm them. there has been a growing number of these lately. where are the mods here?
todays reversal was absolutely ridiculous one minute we had the all clear sign. nvda saved the market. then we reversed hard. but the reversal waited long enough to happen to allow us to adjust some losing positions so we could get double screwed by the drop after getting screwed by the overly sharp initial rise. this shouldn't be this hard.
0dte spy call backtest results actually surprising someone recently asked if its worthwhile to buy cheap $3 otm 0dte spy calls that cost $20–$30 in the morning/when the best time to do so would be. i put together a backtest with historical minutely options data for 0dtes for the month of july and the results were actually kind of interesting. i ran a grid search strategy. each day, i simulated buying one 0dte spy call with varying otm levels ($0 to $4), at five different entry times: 9:30, 9:45, 10:00, 10:15, and 10:30am. i tested take-profit and stop-loss combos from 10% to 100%, and used trailing stops as well. the goal was to find what combination gave the best median return and win rate (note median because you can have outsized gains esp when you don't have a take profit). yes i know this is overfitting, but it could actually prove to be useful data mining and maybe spur more digging (lmk if there are any suggestions to add, would be happy) the sweet spot was buying $2 otm calls at 9:45am, with a take profit of +60% and stop loss of -60%. over all 18 trading days in july, this setup returned a median gain of 62.8%, with a 61.11% win rate. average entry price was about $0.50 per contract. this seems a bit too good to be true, and an important caveat is that we did have a remarkably strong july. so i ran it on april of this year as vix was much higher, and spy took a huge hit in the first half of the month april results were interesting: $4otm at 10:30am seemed to offer the best return/win rate combo. this suggests to me that perhaps in a higher vol setting it may make sense to hold off a bit from the morning, and buy farther otm - happy to hear thoughts around this. attached is a cumulative return plot showing the cumulative return of the chosen strikes (which were $2 out of the money at 9:45am) and a box-and-whisker plot showing return distributions grouped by dollars otm. you can see $2 otm generally offered the best skew, not too expensive, but still with enough gamma juice to print when spy moved caveats: this is a simplified test. it doesn't include commissions, bid/ask spreads, slippage, or some other important factors. and obviously, past performance is no guarantee of anything, this is just a data dive i ran out of curiosity, not a trading recommendation. but i hope it gives a useful sense of what might actually work for those “fun” lotto-style trades people are always curious about. happy to answer any questions, hear your feedback or rerun with different assumptions.
following my rules saved me today relatively newbish, started into options a few weeks ago. like many noobs, lost like $3k on gambling plays when first starting out. just guessing. started trying to take it more serious since last wednesday, been green every day since, slow and steady. however, i’ve been getting lucky by holding some trades longer than my mental stop loss and they rebounded so i could end in profit. told myself all week that i need to stick to a 20% loss, no matter what. thought i had a good entry today. got in too early after open and i’m instantly down $300. temptation was really hard with all the rationalizing, eg ‘just hold for a little longer and it’ll turn around’, ‘flex to 40%’. but i figured i need to be disciplined with these small amounts otherwise i’d never be disciplined when i got to the big numbers. so i sold and took the $300 loss. sat out for like 20 minutes. just processing it. pretty bad entry. and then used the remaining buying power i had after i reset to see if i could make it back. was careful and took profits early. little by little. had to win 7 trades in a row but we ended the day +$8, and i’m happy with that. i’m very glad i sold when i did, even if it hurt. i’m very much a noob but even i have recognized that discipline is the name of the game. figured it might help someone cut their losses even if they don’t want to.
selling my house, car, dog, and grandma to buy more spy calls tomorrow. am i stupid? i’ve been keeping an eye on the tech giants’ massive $320 billion investment plans for ai and data centers this year, with a big chunk likely heading nvidia’s way. nvidia’s q4 earnings are dropping tomorrow, and analysts are buzzing about a 73% revenue jump to $38.2 billion. given nvidia’s clout, i figured this would give the spy etf a nice boost. but here’s the kicker: despite all this good news, there’s a lot of bearish chatter about spy for thursday. as someone still getting the hang of this, i’m scratching my head. what’s driving the pessimism when nvidia seems to be on fire? would love to hear your thoughts and learn more about what’s going on. i get the whole deepseek scare but that’s not bringing this company down so why is everyone so bearish? i’m all in on spy calls tmrw unless someone talks me out of it edit: my dog is my best friend and my grandma is my second best friend (and makes insane food). neither are for sale and each of my plays are typically 1-5% of my liquid capital. i spoke in hyperbole to get the attention of all of you brilliant ladies and gentlemen so that i might learn from you. alas, i’m surprised at the genuine concern for my two best friends. you’d think you can get away with a little exaggeration on the internet... regardless, i appreciate everyone’s input and have learned a lot.
losses that haunt me — options trading wiped out my savings. who else? i don’t even know how to start this. i’m 42 , ex-banker, and pretty good with money — or so i thought. i got into options trading during the pandemic. what started as something casual turned into a daily obsession. i told myself i was being “strategic,” but i was really just chasing dopamine and losses. fast forward to now — i’ve lost over ₹88,00,000 in 2 years. it didn’t happen all at once. small losses turned into bigger ones. a few wins gave me false confidence. i kept adding capital, promising myself i’d “make it back.” i ignored red flags, hid it from my family, and convinced myself i was one trade away from fixing it all. it’s not just about the money. it’s the guilt. the shame. the sheer amount of mental energy i spent staring at charts, greeks, and expiry dates... and for what? i’m writing this because i feel like i’m drowning in silence. everyone talks about their wins. very few talk about the wreckage. i want to hear from you — if you’ve lost money trading options (a little or a lot), can you share your story? even anonymously. just so more people know they’re not alone. if you’ve ever lost big trading — whether it was options, futures, or just bad timing — drop a comment. how much did you lose? what did you learn? how are you coping? let’s make this a thread for real stories
meta $128k loss this was definitely my most regarded trade to date (went way too big and way too short-dated obviously) but to be slightly fair to myself, that "tax hit" was ridiculous and unexpected. the market reaction was swift and immediate as soon as the market closed, way before the earnings call even actually started. indicating it the drop was pretty much entirely due to the reported $1.05 eps despite the claims i've seen others try to make that it wasn't. however, the way li and zuckerberg handled explaining meta's increased capex spend as if they are newly wed couple buying a big house that "they will grow into" when they have kids without ever effing explaining how all this ai bs will make them money in any very convincing manner did not help things and ensured the stock would keep falling. no tears in the casino but this scared me off from "betting" on amazon today and frankly probably going to go back to avoiding playing earnings calls all together. just a completely unnecessary risk. on related note, does anyone have a wendy's application?
i'm picking up google (goog) ahead of apple's wwdc — big ai news incoming i'm buying google stock ahead of apple's wwdc on june 9, betting there's a big ai announcement coming. google looks undervalued right now, about 17% off its recent highs despite posting strong earnings growth (+36% yoy). with a relatively cheap p/e of around 19, it feels like a good time to step in. the real kicker: there's credible buzz that apple might announce a partnership integrating google's gemini ai into ios. even google's ceo sundar pichai has hinted at something big potentially coming by mid-2025. if true, that could drive google shares sharply higher. i'm planning to enter around $168–$172, targeting roughly $190 if the announcement hits. if nothing happens or the rumor fizzles, i'll limit my downside and exit if shares slip below $160.
institutional options hedging surging as sentiment hits zero been digging into some options data lately and noticed something that might be flying under the radar. there’s a tool called prospero that tracks net options sentiment—a metric that aggregates how bullish or bearish institutional flows are across thousands of stocks and etfs—and lately, a lot of bearish sentiment has been showing up. over the past few weeks, institutional risk appetite has basically [fallen off a cliff]( options sentiment may have actually flagged the shift before the market dipped. net options sentiment has essentially flatlined, dropping to zero, which suggests there’s little to no institutional appetite for upside plays at the moment. when sentiment hits that kind of extreme, it can sometimes be a signal that the market is entering the early stages of a longer bear move. not guaranteed, of course, but historically, this kind of setup has shown up before things start to unravel. so what’s driving this? after a significant drop in equities recently (spy and qqq both took a hit), there appears to be aggressive downside hedging by institutions. a big surge in puts is showing up well below current market levels, with almost no demand for calls above. that combo—heavy downside protection and light upside speculation—is a textbook sign of caution, if not outright fear. meanwhile, the headlines are mixed. jpm is saying “[the worst is over,]( and some are calling for a short-term bounce. but the underlying sentiment data—especially from options markets, which tend to move ahead of the headlines—tells a different story. for context: prospero ranks over 2,000 stocks and etfs on this sentiment scale. spy is currently sitting in the most bearish percentile, which historically hasn’t been a great sign. that kind of positioning tends to show up when the smart money is bracing for more pain. curious if others are seeing similar sentiment shifts—whether from vix flow, dark pool activity, or even just price action. is this the bottom, or more pain ahead?
if you're thinking of buying puts, wait i posted this few days back, and it turned out to be the right call (pun intended). just a note of caution, now the vix is back up, put premiums are expensive. i would not suggest buying puts (on spy /qqq or any individual stocks) at this time. wait for a 'bull trap'. edit: (4/22) this may be the bull trap / dead cat bounce. watch for a reversal, and then buy the put. >[vix has dropped. time to buy puts if you're bearish]( by [u/new-ad-9629]( in [options](
s&p futures down 2% rip to credit put spread traders if they opened an over-the-weekend position (me) edit: there might be hop(ium) "trump says to hold talks tomorrow with canada and mexico on tariffs"
i built a script to get the best covered call combination at any time for all stocks what the title says. i spent some time as an options trader at a prop firm and we were using similar tool to optimize certain strategies we wanted to take. built this for myself in my free time. at a high level, it chooses a particular expiration date (5/30/2025 in the example above) and gets the option chain in real time using schwab's api for all stocks in the s&p 500, then calculates the potential payoff and risk profile for all the contracts in the option chain. i used it this week to sell a cc on nvda, but in the example above you can can see that i can sort it by annualized premium, downside protection, etc. and choose the one that i want. for the above calls i filtered by annualized premium above 50% and downside protection above 5% enjoyed making this and curious to hear your thoughts/suggestions what i can add to make it more robust. i currently am thinking to get like an "optimal roll" for the position i am in.
i analyzed over 5000 "option flow" trades so you don't need to waste money on the scammy services i am really sick of people shilling option flow services as though they mean anything. actually, they do mean something, but these people are not there to guide you but to take your money by blasting thousands of trades at you every day, leaving you confused and not knowing what hit you, let alone how you can use the information to make money with it. i took more than 5400 call option trades from 2024, from 3 random m-w-f in each of the months, and i analyzed them with a single question in mind: do these trades carry information that is private to the trader and is not yet reflected in the stock price, and if so, how often do these call options end up in the money and or profitable at expiration? here is a breakout by delta, and you can see that the win percentage underperforms delta by a little but it tracks pretty closely. the main point being - only 27% of these trades are winners and a whopping 63% are losing trades. here is a breakout that is similar to delta but is my moneyness, i.e. the relationship of the stock price at the time of the trade to the option strike: and finally, here is a breakout by trade size, so there is an uptick in the correlation between trade size and win %, but it is still really low. while the frequency is telling a pretty pathetic story, there is a model where fundamental and technical factors can be added to these trades, and while the probability of each trade is not much different, that subset contains large winning trades that outweigh the small and more frequent losses. in addition, there are ways to trade this subset that is not as simple as buying the single options, so that even if no large move ensues, the trader at least recuperates some of the premium. that is a topic for another post though, because the point of this post is that just blasting thousands of trade records at retail traders is useless, confusing and misleading and the only ones making money with it are the scammy service providers, while retail traders are losing money on random losing trades and the subscriptions to boot. i hope you find this informative, and that you stay away from the shills peddling "option flow" "smart money" and other scammy alert services. cheers! edit: here is the table by "side" meaning if the trade was opened at the ask, bid or mid, and it is meaningless, but people are clueless and lead to believe that trades at the ask have meaning - they do not.
first 4 months of trading options i started trading options a few months ago. to simplify tax management, i decided to max out my ira. i tried paper trading at first, but honestly, i wanted to get comfortable using one mobile platform (hello, robinhood) and see how far i could grow my account. since blowing up the account wouldn’t have significant financial consequences, i was okay with taking some risks. to learn faster, i experimented with different strategies. initially, i bought 30 dte calls for stocks i was familiar with, like nvda and rddt. i limited my risk to about 10% of my account per trade and aimed to take profits around 30% before moving on to new positions. this approach worked reasonably well. since i have a day job and can’t monitor the market all day, i mostly trade during breaks (yes, even during bio breaks). later, i switched to trading spy options with 7 dte. i based my entries on noticeable market dips—nothing fancy like advanced indicators or charting strategies. toward the end of the year, the market was bullish, so i tried scalping options based on momentum. this strategy worked most of the time, but things unraveled during the market downturn in late december. i broke my own rules and entered a tsla position with 40% of my account on 30 dte $445 calls. at the same time, i averaged down on short-term spy options when the price dropped below $580. the screenshot i attached isn’t fully representative of my performance because i had to liquidate my positions to roll over my ira into a new account. but that’s the story. tl;dr: i started with $7k and grew it to $9k within a few weeks. however, the market downturn brought my account below $2k. i’ve since deposited another $7k into my ira, and i’m hoping to apply my lessons and improve in the coming months. my learnings going into 2025: 1. strictly follow my rules, no matter how tempting a position might seem. 2. avoid expensive options until my account can support them. no more tsla or nflx trades for now. 3. don’t try catching a falling knife. this is easier said than done, but spacing out entries might help. i’ll limit risk to 10% per position and cap my trades to no more than three positions per week. 4. start using stop-loss orders. since i can’t monitor positions all the time, stop-losses could help me avoid forgetting about trades. feedback welcome! am i missing anything else?
i bought puts minutes before the tariff pause so, i bought 12/19 $220 mstr puts shortly before the 90 day tariff pause. bitcoin is up right now and i’m going to get killed on monday. i’m down 30% now. i’m willing to ride it out, but wanted to know what my best strategies might be at this point to mitigate the losses. should i sell puts at the same strike but a shorter expiration date? what’s the best course of action here?
most used strategies by options traders so i've been digging into some of the most commonly used options strategies by retail-/institutional traders and not just what they are, but why they're used depending on market conditions and risk profiles. here are some of them: (you can see their payoff diagrams in the images) 1. covered call this strategy is great for generating income on long stock options, especially in sideways markets. 2. cash-secured-puts they're often used to obtain stocks at a discount or to generate income with a defined risk. 3. vertical spreads (bull/bear) perfect for directional plays with capped risk/reward 4. iron condors popular in low volatility environnements to collect theta decay. the intresting thing is how traders choose strategies based not just on market outlook, but also personal psychology.. (for example when it comes to tolerance for drawdowns and asymmetry in payoff. which option strategy do you find the best and why?
to people who made millions on spy 0dte puts today if you made millions on spy/spx 0dte puts today, were you buying and selling only on the sharp dips or were you somehow able to distinguish pullbacks from reversals? or did you gamble with “small” amounts and were prepared to lose it all?
should i take 73% profit on my deep itm nvda leap or hold through earnings? hey everyone, i’m holding a deep itm nvda leap — $104 call expiring june 2026. my breakeven is $152, and right now i’m sitting on about 73% profit. with earnings coming next week, i’m conflicted: * on one hand, a lot of people are very bullish on nvidia’s numbers and ai demand. * on the other, i know earnings volatility can wipe out short-term gains even if the long-term story is strong. * powell also hinted at potential rate cuts in september, which could be positive for growth stocks like nvda. would you: 1. lock in profits now and maybe re-enter later? 2. hold through earnings and ride the potential upside? looking for opinions from folks who’ve been through nvda earnings swings before, especially with leaps. thanks!
