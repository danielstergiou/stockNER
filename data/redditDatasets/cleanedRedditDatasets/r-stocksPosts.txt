now we know. it was retail ceos who got to trump on monday as reported by axios, trump was shaken monday after meeting with ceo’s of top retail companies like target. they warned him that disrupted supply chains due to his china tariffs would mean empty shelves and soaring prices very soon. you can imagine how the optics of bare shelves all around the country would look. maybe they will get exemptions as trump’s crony capitalism marches on but a huge number of small businesses won’t and will go under. somewhere xi is smirking.
america is going to get rocked. china, japan, south korea will jointly respond to us tariffs, chinese state media says [ beijing, march 31 (reuters) - china, japan and south korea agreed to jointly respond to u.s. tariffs, a social media account affiliated with chinese state broadcaster cctv said on monday.the comments came after the three countries held their first [economic dialogue]( in five years on sunday, seeking to facilitate regional trade as the asian export powers brace against u.s. president donald trump's tariffs. eu hasn't even clap back yet. edit. for those who say this is chinese media, the other countries are not refuting this claim. china is taking the lead on this. for eu, i think germany will take the lead on that. edit 2. since there are many comments regarding this being chinese propaganda, below are more links to prove that this isn't just coming from chinese media.

china officially makes statement stating that all tariffs are remaining on american good and the country is "not" interested in negotiations china vows to stand firm, urges nations to resist ‘bully’ trump chinese foreign minister wang yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a brics meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against us levies. china’s top diplomat warned countries against caving into us tariff threats, as the trump administration hints at the possible use of new trade tools to pressure beijing. chinese foreign minister wang yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a brics meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against us levies. the stern remarks show china intends to resist pressure to enter trade talks even as us treasury secretary scott bessent suggests washington could ban certain exports to china to gain leverage. wang’s call to the international community underscores china’s attempt to portray itself as the bastion of free trade as us tariffs threaten to reshape commerce globally. beijing has repeatedly urged allies to defend multilateralism and told other governments not to cut deals with the us president at china’s expense. china has repeatedly denied being engaged in trade talks with the us. instead, beijing has demanded mutual respect and a cancellation of all tariffs before any negotiations. i wonder how trump is going to respond to this. maybe another 500% tariffs on china? including this and gdp data this wednesday, market is going to get rekt. get your lubes ready.
fox reporter says the trump white house is giving wall street executives inside info on tariff negotiations fox business senior correspondent charles gasparino reported on thursday that president donald trump’s administration is privately discussing trade tariff deals with wall street executives, sharing insights on their current status, which is information not being made public otherwise. citing “senior wall street execs with ties to the white house,” gasparino wrote on x that people within trump’s administration have held private discussions with business leaders about an “agreement in principle with india.” he further reported that the deal could be used as a template for other trade deals the administration is working on with japan and other countries. markets have taken sharp hits amid uncertainty surrounding trump’s tariffs and trade deals. see

market in free fall, approx 10 hours left for usa futures to open and trump hasn't taken any action or said any word to show his leadership. hello everyone, market currently is in a free fall and stocks are going down and wealth is being destroyed like there is no tomorrow and 401k and portfolio of many people is in shambles right now and many startup companies and many companies that are struggling, it is being even more harder for them to stay afloat in this volatile market. whilst all this is happening, you know what has trump been up to you? he has been planning for a very special dinner instead of addressing this very crucial situation that affects all of us. [trump headlining $1 million a person super pac dinner as stocks sink over tariffs]( i kinda find it very foul that this administration is doing nothing about this current issue on the hand and is allowing all this chaos to take place in the market. they have done nothing to ease the current situation and if this continues and if truly have black monday awaiting tomorrow, it would be catastrophic economic crisis caused by the administration and would cause numerous businesses to go bankrupt and spark mass unemployment as a consequence. very sad to see this whole situation unfold like this.
it’s over. the market is cooked. hope you enjoyed the ride. this isn’t a dip. it’s not a correction. it’s the slow, brutal unraveling of a debt-soaked fantasy we’ve been pretending was sustainable since 2008. the fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. the only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k). tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals. ai was a sugar high. now we’re crashing. banks are getting shaky. commercial real estate is a time bomb. and consumers? they're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs. and just when we needed stability, we get chaos: trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a denny’s at 3 a.m. markets hate uncertainty—guess what? that’s all we’ve got now. this isn’t a crash. it’s controlled demolition with nobody at the controls. sell, don’t look back, and maybe plant a garden. we had a good run. goodbye, and may whatever comes next be merciful.
average americans don't have cash laying around to "buy the dip" i am sick of all the posts cheering on this freefall . telling everyone that this some kind of "opportunity." a large swath of americans do have money in the stock market via 401ks. what they do not have is a pile of cash laying around to buy stocks. just stop. this is decimating millions of americans. i know many people who are now having to completely recalculate their plans for retirement. some have lost the equivalent of 2+ years of contributions, along with natching funds. it will take 5 years to recoup the loss in value. so again, please stop trying to gloss this over like we're being done a favor. edit: please stop with the investment advice. not looking for it, don't need it. if that's all you have to offer, please move on. the crux of the post was pointing out the absurdity of cabinet secretaries giving investment advice. tldr: cabinet secretaries, in an attempt to placate the masses, are giving investment advice.
trump folded, it was because of the bond market "people were getting a little queasy." trump says he was watching bond market reaction to tariff measures president donald trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs. “i was watching the bond market. the bond market is very tricky. i was watching it. but if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. the bond market right now is beautiful. but yeah, i saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said. cnn reported prior to the president’s decision that us treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. the benchmark 10-year yield wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before trump unveiled his tariffs. trump also said he watched jp morgan chase ceo jamie dimon on fox business network this morning. the ceo “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. ... he understood it,” trump said. “it wasn’t sustainable what was happening. somebody had to pull the trigger. i was willing to pull the trigger.” during that appearance, dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from trump’s tariff policies. “no one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “i do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.”
president donald trump has officially just signed the executive order to increase chinese tariffs to 104% trump said tonight that his plans for 104% tariffs on imported chinese goods will remain until china makes a deal with the united states. "until they make a deal with us, that’s what it’s going to be," trump said at the national republican congressional committee dinner. "i think they’ll make a deal at some point, china will. they want to make a deal. they really do." china said earlier today that it will “fight to the end” if trump goes forward with his plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on chinese goods that are set to take effect at midnight, bringing the tariff amount to 104%. it's official now, china's 114% total tariffs go into effect tonight and global tariffs as well. may we all survive through this week. it's about to get real spicy with china retaliating soon 🫠
trump set on firing jerome powell (posted on truth social) trump tweet complaining about jerome powell and the fed not cutting rates "fast enough" while praising the ecb for their aggressive cuts. i have to break down how flawed this take is and why this thinking can actually harm the economy in the long run. calling jerome powell “too late” and demanding his "termination" because he didn’t cut rates to suit trade war is extremely dangerous. let’s not forget: market stability *requires* trust in the fed's independence. undermining that trust can loose investors more than any interest rate hike ever could. source: [

tsla being investigated by transport canada for cooking their books in canada to snag ev rebates without selling cars. the article notes that **four tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 teslas in 3 days.** assuming each dealership opens from 9am-5pm, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. worth noting that canada's ev rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did... ironic that musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of canadian taxpayer-funded ev rebates himself to the tune of $43m. i guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%! note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet. edit: since this post got more attention then i expected. yes i posted this sunday and tsla is currently down 13% today. however i do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from europe sales declines. the article was published friday morning and tesla was up 3% by end of friday.

canada will retaliate with 25% tariffs on us imports and limit export of rare minerals as response to trump tariffs! trade war is on! canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of u.s. goods after u.s. president donald trump slapped canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity. prime minister justin trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later. trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if canada retaliates against the u.s. canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the us which are crucial for us tech and car companies like tesla. **tldr: trade war is on! stocks may take hit and bond yields may spike (because of inflation fears) so position your portfolio carefully.**

breaking: 30-year treasury yield is now above 5%. china dumping us bonds at a high rate! armageddon on tomorrows market guaranteed bond rout starting to sound market alarm bells singapore (reuters) - u.s. treasuries extended heavy losses on wednesday in a sign investors are selling even their safest assets as a global market rout unleashed by u.s. tariffs takes an unnerving turn towards distress and a dash for the safety of cash. "this is beyond fundamentals right now. this is about liquidity," said jack chambers, senior rates strategist at anz in sydney. the 10-year u.s. treasury yield, the globe's benchmark safe-haven anchor, was up 20 basis points and rising in asia - a remarkable move in a time zone where it's usually fairly steady. at 4.46% the yield is up 59 basis points from monday's low, with traders saying hedge funds were the heaviest sellers as they started to be forced from leveraged bets that in calmer times profit from small gaps between cash and futures prices. "this kind of thing becomes problematic if the prime broker starts saying that now ... i want to charge you a higher margin or i basically want more margins from you," said mukesh dave, chief investment officer at aravali asset management, a global arbitrage fund based in singapore. thirty-year u.s. yields spiked 24 bps to 4.9553% and the three-day move in yield - if sustained - would mark the heaviest selloff in the long end since 1981. selling was heavy in japan and australia. so basically we are going back to the stone ages tomorrow. this is much much worse than you think...
us tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to us sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14b in economic spending here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how i'm trading the us tourism dip. **1. canada is the us's largest source of tourism**: in 2024, 20 million canadian tourists visited the us, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 us jobs. canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the us had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits. **2. recent us policies is leading to a tourism boycott from canadians, and the rest of the world**: tourists are boycotting us tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in march a canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ice facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed). **3. analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** for canada alone (26% of us's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their us trips. **4. here's how i'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** i'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to can-us routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). i'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in us states that border canada like niagara falls. the us travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), i expect hospitality to have lower revenues. i'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short target, long dollar general). i'm long, and buying, non-american/europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the us, as i expect canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to europe/asia/oceania travel this summer. **edit 5. how do the european/international figures play?** it's important to note that the canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. and we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. the us admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during "liberation day". the point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. but if the canadian consumer is any indication, i have more conviction in my trades. **a glimpse into this being a trend is a french travel company reporting to bloomberg their europe to us travel bookings are down 25%.** **edit 6. example of the airline play** yes i know us airlines are already down a lot. rode that wave and exited my shorts. now i'm shorting air canada and onex (parent company of westjet), since they have much more exposure to us-can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see us/canada travel. but going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for us/canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand. would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. thanks! **source for numbers used** * [ * [ * [ * [ * [ * [ * [ * [
nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in u.s. history nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in u.s. history. the chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. it was nvidia’s worst day on the market since march 16, 2020, which was early in the covid pandemic. after surpassing apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, nvidia’s drop on monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy nasdaq. the selloff was sparked by concerns that chinese artificial intelligence lab deepseek is presenting increased competition in the global ai battle. late last month, deepseek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from nvidia, called h800s. nvidia’s graphics processing units (gpus) dominate the market for ai data center chips in the u.s., with tech giants like alphabet, meta, and amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their ai models. analysts at cantor wrote in a report on monday that the release of deepseek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on gpus.” the analysts, who recommend buying nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in ai will most likely lead to “the ai industry wanting more compute, not less.” but after nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. broadcom, the other big u.s. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from ai, fell 17% on monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion. data center companies reliant on nvidia’s gpus for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. dell, hewlett packard enterprise and super micro computer dropped at least 5.8%. oracle, a part of president donald trump’s latest ai initiative, fell 14%. for nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in september, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by apple in 2020. nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of coca-cola and chevron and exceeds the market value of both oracle and netflix. ceo jensen huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to forbes’ real-time billionaires list. the move demoted huang to 17th on the richest-person list. the sudden excitement around deepseek over the weekend pushed its app past openai’s chatgpt as the most-downloaded free app in the u.s. on apple’s app store. the model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on u.s. chip exports to china. venture capitalist david sacks, who was tapped by trump to be the white house’s ai and crypto czar, wrote on x that deepseek’s model “shows that the ai race will be very competitive” and that trump was right to rescind president joe biden’s executive order last week on ai safety. “i’m confident in the u.s. but we can’t be complacent,” sacks wrote. nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind apple and microsoft. source:
us credit rating has been downgraded today, may 15th, moody's, downgraded the united states credit rating. they cited that "successive us administrations and congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs." a credit rating downgrade will lead to higher costs of borrowing and ultimately a further downturn of the economy.
tesla: the company is one giant lie tesla just posted abysmal earnings, and how does elon respond? with another song and dance about robots and self-driving cars—fairy tales he’s been spinning for years with no real results. meanwhile, the fundamentals are crumbling: declining margins, demand issues, and brutal price cuts just to move inventory. this company has been built on hype, not substance. fsd is nowhere near what was promised, cybertruck is a disaster, and now they’re leaning on ai pipe dreams to distract from the financial mess. when a catalyst hits this, downward price action will be the most drastic in history.
trump to announce new 20% tariffs this week on every single us trading partner, not just the initial group of 10-15 countries prev. stated what industries will this impact the most? previous tariffs announcements have been easy to understand what industries it will impact (for example auto tariffs, wine tariffs, etc.). what would a sweeping 20% tariff on virtually every single us trading partner mean for investing? will it lead to lower consumer demand in an already weak us consumer? will it lead to higher profits for us based companies? don't most us companies manufacturer outside of the us, so their operating costs/cogs will increase? **is anyone still buying sp500 etfs, or have people begun to sell? not sure what to do with my portfolio, or if i should dollar cost average buy vs. sell. if anyone can share how they are navigating this uncertainty - leaving the market completely or riding it out.** \--- sources [ [

tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20% tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier. here are the key numbers compared with lseg expectations. * **earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated * **revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year. tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular model y suv. the company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit. net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago. it’s been a brutal start to the year for tesla, with ceo elon musk spending much of his time in president donald trump’s white house, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. the president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells. tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in march. the stock was little changed in extended trading on tuesday. the company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our q2 update.” in its shareholder deck, tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of tesla and our peers.” the company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products. tesla has faced widespread protests in the u.s. and europe, where musk has actively supported germany’s far-right afd party. earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681. tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in china, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the u.s. by alphabet’s waymo. the company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in austin, texas, in june. the company reassured investors on tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in fremont, california, this year. operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. the company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline. the company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. revenue from the credits, which tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year. energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. the company said growth in ai infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.” tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. the company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.” source: [tesla (tsla) earnings report q1 2025](
tesla done in germany. 94% say they won’t buy a tesla car. a survey of over 100,000 germans revealed that 94% won't buy a tesla vehicle. it doesn't bode well for the automaker, whose sales had already been falling off a cliff in the important european market. in 2024, tesla saw a 41% reduction in sales in germany compared to 2023 despite ev sales surging 27% during the year.
is tsla permanently toast? i saw trump just put out a tweet literally begging people to buy tesla cars, an apparent act of desperation by musk. musk now seems to be despised by the blue voters, who were the main purchasers of tesla cars. what's more, the problem is even more acute in europe. in a very short period, tesla has become the most uncool car on the market. i don't know how the company's stock will not continue to slide.

trump announces 25% tariffs on all cars ‘not made in the united states’ [ president donald trump on wednesday said he would impose 25% tariffs on “all cars that are not made in the united states.” trump said in the oval office that there is “absolutely no tariff” for cars that are made in the u.s. trump on monday had hinted that the auto tariffs could arrive prior to april 2, the day his sweeping “reciprocal tariff” plan is set to begin. “we’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then april 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said at a cabinet meeting. trump has long signaled his plans to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners. but his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future. trump has hyped april 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one.” his plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on u.s. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes. but trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming april 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared. trump said friday that “there’ll be flexibility” on those tariffs, and on tuesday night suggested the duties will be more “lenient than reciprocal.” treasury secretary scott bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the u.s. to avoid facing new tariffs on april 2.
mcdonald's reports largest revenue drop in us since pandemic as consumers pull back on spending sales shrank almost 4%, at 3.6%. it's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contracting sales from the us consumer. especially staples that are concerned with affordability like walmart and mcdonalds. if consumers are pulling back spending on "cheap", low cart value items like a mcdonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend on higher price discretionary categories like electronics, home reno, travel, etc. the flip side of this - other fast food companies like domino's have been doing fine. so maybe this is also a combination of mcdonald's price hikes, lack of promotions, declining affordability, and increased competition. it could be both the macro and the company specific issues that created this result.
breaking: trump places 100% tariff on china starting november 1st the s&p 500 falls 70+ points in seconds after president trump publishes the below paragraph about china. donald j. trump truth social post 04:50 pm est 10/10/25 it has just been learned that china has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the world, stating that they were going to, effective november 1st, 2025, impose large scale export controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. this affects all countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. it is absolutely unheard of in international trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other nations. based on the fact that china has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the u.s.a., and not other nations who were similarly threatened, starting november 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by china), the united states of america will impose a tariff of 100% on china, over and above any tariff that they are currently paying. also on november 1st, we will impose export controls on any and all critical software. it is impossible to believe that china would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is history. thank you for your attention to this matter! donald j. trump president of the united states of america
wsj: dow headed for worst april since 1932 as investors send ‘no confidence’ signal [story]( hats off to the administration for this amazing accomplishment. it takes coordinated ineptitude to pull this off and the administration delivered it in spades. to be clear, this is not the end of the world. the world is fine and it is not going to implode. i live in asia and although people here do expect a recession, they are not running around with their hair on fire. however, the us exceptionalism and the dominance of the us dollar are very likely to end, as declaring trade war against the entire world, ignoring court orders and attacking the independence of the central bank are all very stupid things to do. "trade wars are good and easy to win" \-donald trump
the us bond market is continuing to crash. will this make trump back off of china? bond yields peaked right before trump paused his tariffs. trump himself even said he paused because the bond markets were getting “yippy” and lots of sources say the bond market crash was his main reason for the pause. today bond yields have spiked just as high as they were when trump enacted his 90 day pause. he clearly cares about this measure given the action he took a few days ago. could this continued sell off on bonds cause trump to back off of china? according the the ft, ten minutes ago, talking about bond yields today: “they point to a complete loss of faith in the strongest bond market in the world.” i know i’m the one who asked the question, but in my opinion it seems like there’s a decent chance this will cause trump to back off, because otherwise this will lead to a much larger crisis, with the u.s losing its reserve currency status and the debt becoming more expensive than whatever we may generate from tariffs. he already backed off once for the same reason....
agriculture isn't nearing trade war tariffs crisis, 'it is full blown crisis already' farmers say >the global backlash to president trump’s tariffs is punishing u.s. agriculture, especially a decline in chinese buying of u.s. farm products. >a leading agriculture exports group says “massive” losses are already racking up at farms, with cancelled orders, pricing pressure as demand slumps and layoffs, as china stops buying products from pork to hay and straw, and lumber. >“no one can replace all the volume that china buys,” one farm operator reported.
cnbc: trump directs commissioner of labor statistics to be fired [source with info.]( no doubt he'll accuse him of faking the numbers to make him look bad and try to install someone who will only report sunshine and rainbows. this, obviously, comes after the july report showed only 73k jobs added and dramatic decreases of the may and june reports. edit: yup, blaming her for trying to make him look bad. > i was just informed that our country’s “jobs numbers” are being produced by a biden appointee, dr. erika mcentarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, who faked the jobs numbers before the election to try and boost kamala’s [harris’] chances of victory,” trump wrote.
the reality of what’s happening. it’s crazy i’m at an auto shop getting the car done today and i’m overhearing people talking about the market. this guy in here is saying how it’s all smart and trump is trying to do a 20% cut on purpose. he was saying we need to bring these manufacturing jobs here, and said yeah we need to make tires here! i’m not an expert but i’m fairly sure the us has almost no rubber plantations or manufacturing. on top of the other issues like the fact that who the fuck would want to work at a rubber plantation? then he was saying that hopefully all this manufacturing will be back in the us before the tariffs affect prices! he was saying that almost all brake fluid is made in the usa which idk how true that is but sounds false, not to mention it doesn’t ask the question of where do the plastic containers or aluminum containers it’s stored in come from? not to mention the many other auto parts that aren’t made here and won’t be made here. he is a normal mechanic in a swing state, just seeing the opinion of the everyday person shows me how deep people are into this and they will not accept that this isn’t part of a master plan in their favor. i also notice he keeps talking about the “trillions” of dollars that are going to be invested in this country like they would see any of that. it’s just proof that trump announcing these investments literally works perfectly to placate many. my prediction is that the stock market continues to shrink until the tariffs are gone at least and that about half the country will be in denial about it.
tariffs are back on trump says! **trump on truth social**: nobody is getting “off the hook” for the unfair trade balances, and non monetary tariff barriers, that other countries have used against us, especially not china which, by far, treats us the worst! there was no tariff “exception” announced on friday. these products are subject to the existing 20% fentanyl tariffs, and they are just moving to a different tariff “bucket.” the fake news knows this, but refuses to report it. we are taking a look at semiconductors and the whole electronics supply chain in the upcoming national security tariff investigations. what has been exposed is that we need to make products in the united states, and that we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like china, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the american people. we also cannot let them continue to abuse us on trade, like they have for decades, those days are over! the golden age of america, which includes the upcoming tax and regulation cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the house and senate, will mean more and better paying jobs, making products in our nation, and treating other countries, in particular china, the same way they have treated us. the bottom line is that our country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. we will, make america great again! this is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless trump or the white house covers on it. tariffs are back on now!
companies in the eu are starting to look for ways to ditch amazon, google, and microsoft cloud services. #trump’s aggression sours europe on us cloud giants ###companies in the eu are starting to look for ways to ditch amazon, google, and microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the us. but cutting ties won’t be easy. > the global backlash against the second donald trump administration keeps on growing. canadians have boycotted us-made products, anti–elon musk posters have appeared across london amid widespread tesla protests, and european officials have drastically increased military spending as us support for ukraine falters. dominant us tech services may be the next focus. > there are early signs that some european companies and governments are souring on their use of american cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. between them, google cloud, microsoft azure, and amazon web services (aws) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. however, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the trump administration. > “there’s a huge appetite in europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on us tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against european interests,” says marietje schaake, a nonresident fellow at stanford’s cyber policy center and a former, decade-long member of the european parliament. > the moves may already be underway. on march 18, politicians in the netherlands house of representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on us tech companies and move to european alternatives. days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to european officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.” > two european-based cloud service companies, exoscale and elastx, tell wired they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon us cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems. > “we have more demand from across europe,” says mathias nöbauer, the ceo of swiss-based hosting provider exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “some customers were very explicit,” nöbauer says. “especially customers from denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from us hyperscalers because of the us administration and what they said about greenland.” > “it's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. and from the europeans’ perspective—that the us is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says joakim öhman, the ceo of swedish cloud provider elastx. “those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.” > concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the eu and us, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by european courts. at the end of january, trump fired three democrats from the privacy and civil liberties oversight board (pclob), which helps manage the current agreement. the move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. in addition, öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the cloud act, which can allow us law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the us. > dave cottlehuber, the founder of skunkwerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from us providers to european services since the start of the year. “first and foremost, it’s about values,” cottlehuber says. “for me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the trump administration. “the best thing i can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” cottlehuber says. > steffen schmidt, the ceo of medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in europe, says that having data in europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively european companies,” schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to nöbauer’s exoscale. > harry staight, a spokesperson for aws, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from aws to eu alternatives. “our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the aws cloud sovereign-by-design,” straight says. “aws services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to aws, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” staight says the membership of the pclob “does not impact” the agreements around eu-us data sharing and that the cloud act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” google and microsoft declined to comment. > the potential shift away from us tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. since january 15, visitors to the european alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. the site lists everything from music streaming services to ddos protection tools, says marko saric, a cofounder of european cloud analytics service plausible. “we can certainly feel that something is going on,” saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of march the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in january and february. “this is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says. > while there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing ai processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “what happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says. > for years, european companies have struggled to compete with the likes of google, microsoft, and amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. it may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative european cloud firms. > “if you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says bert hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to us firms being put on hold or reconsidered. hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for european governments to be moved to us clouds and that european alternatives can’t properly compete. “we sell a lot of fine wood here in europe. but not that much furniture,” he says. however, that too could change. > schaake, the former member of the european parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a europe-first approach or investing in a european technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “the dramatic shift of the trump administration is very tangible,” schaake says. “the idea that anything could happen and that europe should fend for itself is clear. now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.” **credit:** *(matt burgess is a senior writer at wired focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in europe. he

trump orders creation of us sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy tiktok [ u.s. president donald trump signed an executive order on monday ordering the u.s. treasury and commerce departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase tiktok. "we're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. we're going to monetize the asset side of the u.s. balance sheet for the american people," treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters. "there'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the american people." trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund "great national endeavors" like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but trump previously said it could be funded by "tariffs and other intelligent things." typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the u.s. operates at a deficit. there are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the international forum of sovereign wealth funds. tiktok, which has about 170 million american users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its chinese owner bytedance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on jan. 19.trump, after taking office on jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over tiktok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in february.

tesla speeds up odometers to avoid warranty repairs, us lawsuit claims [ (reuters) - tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving elon musk's company from having to pay for repairs. the plaintiff nyree hinton alleged that tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and "predictive algorithms" rather than actual mileage driven. he said the odometer on the 2020 model y he bought in december 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20. hinton, a los angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought tesla should cover. "by tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely," the complaint said. tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. the austin, texas-based company does not have a media relations office. hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for tesla drivers in california, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show. tesla moved his lawsuit this month to los angeles federal court from a state court in that city. the automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges. in march 2024, a federal judge in oakland, california said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action. the case is hinton v tesla inc et al, u.s. district court, central district of california, no. 25-02877.
because i work for a big wall street firm, i'm limited on what i can write here. but here's a story you may enjoy. as mentioned, i've been w/a big wall street firm for decades, which means that i have a lot of restrictions on what i can write publicly. but pretty sure this story is fine, since the company is long gone. an old, but true, story. it is represents much of what i went through in the late 1990s, in the midst of the dot com bubble. etoys was an online toy retailer that did an ipo in january 1999 for $20 per share. by the end of the day, it closed at $76 per share. i received a call from a client, who was probably in her late 70s at the time. she mostly bought blue chip stocks, utility stocks, preferreds, and tax-free bonds. the conversation went something like this... client: sj, i want to buy a stock. me: ok, what are we looking at? client: it's called etoys. they sell toys online. they are going to be the next toys r us, only bigger! me: (looking things over) me: you know, they did their ipo at $20 and the stock is now at $80? client: i know, they're doing very well! me: the stock is doing very well, but i'm not sure that the company is doing too well. they are new and unproven and they don't have anything resembling a profit or net income. why do you want to buy this thing? client: my son-in-law recommended it. he is a very smart young man! me: well, he may be smart, but i also know that son-in-laws can get you in a lot of trouble. how many shares are you considering? client: i want to buy 1,000 shares! me: that's $80,000! (a lot of money now, but really a lot back in the late 1990s). client: i know. i have a lot of confidence in etoys and in my son-in-law! me: can i talk you out of buying this stock? client: no, i've made up my mind. me: are you open to a compromise? client: what do you have in mind? me: instead of buying 1,000 shares of etoys, let's buy 50 shares instead. client: 50 shares? but that's only $4,000! me: i know, but i'll feel a lot better watching you lose $4,000 than i would if you lost $80,000. (long pause) client: ok, do it. buy me 50 shares of etoys! i bought the shares, the company went bankrupt, and she lost all of her money. but again, a $4,000 loss beats the heck out of an $80,000 loss!

trump tells walmart to 'eat the tariffs' instead of raising prices washington (reuters) -u.s. president donald trump said on saturday that walmart should "eat the tariffs" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices. his comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs. "walmart should stop trying to blame tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. walmart made billions of dollars last year, far more than expected," trump said in a social media post. "between walmart and china they should, as is said, 'eat the tariffs,' and not charge valued customers anything." a representative of walmart could not be immediately reached for comment. walmart ceo doug mcmillon said on thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from china - would not drive food prices higher. many u.s. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the u.s. and its trading partners, particularly china, as consumers curtail spending. as a bellwether of u.s. consumer health, walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the u.s. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a walmart. walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that amazon planned to disclose how much trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. the white house blasted amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.
donald trump authorises 90-day pause on all tariffs effective immediately quote from trump: "based on the lack of respect that china has shown to the world’s markets, i am hereby raising the tariff charged to china by the united states of america to 125%, effective immediately. at some point, hopefully in the near future, china will realize that the days of ripping off the u.s.a., and other countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the united states, including the departments of commerce, treasury, and the ustr, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to trade, trade barriers, tariffs, currency manipulation, and non monetary tariffs, and that these countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the united states, i have authorized a 90 day pause, and a substantially lowered reciprocal tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. thank you for your attention to this matter!"

this uk trade deal is an absolute nothing-burger and yet the market continues to pump. i can’t believe we let this orange clown continue to spew bullshit and reward him for it. the tariffs aren’t leaving, there’s still a 10% blanket tariff on all imports from the uk and that’s even with a big beautiful earth shattering deal. what are we even doing man? we can’t even remove a blanket tariff on a country we have a trade surplus with? the tariffs aren’t getting resolved it’s so obvious.
firing powell would hurt the dollar and us economy, france says [ (bloomberg) — president donald trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the us economy if he fired federal reserve chair jerome powell, french finance minister eric lombard warned. “donald trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs — for a long time,” lombard said in an interview published in the la tribune dimanche newspaper. if powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.” the result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the us sooner or later to talks to end the tensions. lombard’s comments come after trump, frustrated with powell’s caution to cut us interest rates, posted on social media thursday that powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” it wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is may 2026. national economic council director kevin hassett said friday trump was studying whether he could fire him. president emmanuel macron has opposed trump on a series of issues including ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in france for us-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut. even so, lombard’s comments are unusually direct about us domestic matters. on tariffs, france’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs trump has imposed on imports from the eu don’t constitute “common ground” and that europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the us. the 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the us economy and represents major risks for global trade,” lombard said. the finance minister also called on european ceos to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out. on thursday, french billionaire bernard arnault, whose group lvmh owns champagne labels like moët & chandon and veuve clicquot as well as hennessy cognac, seemed to suggest that eu leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.

office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision. >“number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to canada and to mexico in the form of deficits,” he said. >west texas intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. the us dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the canadian dollar and mexican peso both plunged. us treasuries pared their gains. >trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.” >but the us president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. trump said would be making a determination as soon as thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil. >“we don’t need the products that they have. we have all the oil that you need. we have all the trees you need,” trump added, referring to major imports from canada. >trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the us president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade. >trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions. >trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on china. he didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. trump has said beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the us. >“with china, i’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” trump said thursday. “so china is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.” >trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether china complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy. >following through on tariffs against canada and mexico, who are us neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement. >both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the us they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict. >“if these tariffs go into effect, canada will respond,” canadian ambassador to the us kirsten hillman said thursday. “this is not something that we want to do. we do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the united states. it’s not good for canada, canadians and canadian workers and it’s not good for the united states, americans and american workers.” >hillman said that canada has responded to trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters. >canadian prime minister justin trudeau visited trump at his mar-a-lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and mexican president claudia sheinbaum spoke to trump to try to avert the levies. >in the first 11 months of 2024, us trade with canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with mexico. and the magnitude of tariffs trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. shares of us automakers ford motor co. and general motors co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains. >“president trump’s tariffs will tax america first,” matthew holmes, executive vice president at the canadian chamber of commerce, said thursday. “from higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. this is a lose-lose.” >trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including canada and mexico. >the us president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials. >he’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the us, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from canada and mexico on

us fed chair jay powell speaking today in chicago, warns of decreasing growth combined with increasing and prolonged price inflation ahead currently happening live - key points that were interesting [ [ "powell said the president’s tariffs announced so far had been 'significantly larger than anticipated', adding that 'the same was likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth'." powell "later added that those economic effects may place us rate setters 'in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension'. the fed’s dual mandate is to keep inflation at 2 per cent while promoting 'maximum' employment levels." "several fed officials — including john williams, head of the new york fed, and governor christopher waller — have said inflation is likely to surge in the coming months on the back of the administration’s proposed tariffs. while waller thinks the impact of tariffs will prove shortlived, other members of the rate-setting federal open market committee which powell chairs believe trump’s tariffs have increased the odds that inflation will be a longer problem for us consumers." "the us central bank has kept its benchmark federal funds target range at 4.25-4.5 per cent this year, with officials saying they are well-placed to respond once the economic data show the effects of the president’s policies on american businesses and households."

the u.s. dollar fell about 11% against other currencies in the first half of this year, its biggest decline in over 50 years > the u.s. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the u.s.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from january through the end of june. that decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. > although the currency strengthened 3.2% in july, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, morgan stanley research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year. “we're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says david adams, head of g10 fx strategy at morgan stanley. “the second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as u.s. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” > the u.s. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: it would be more expensive for americans to travel abroad. u.s. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation. on the positive side, however, the weaker dollar could be a boost for american exporters.

target takes an earnings beating target has had bad news after bad news. in the most completely politically agnostic way, their dei stance really hurt the brand and store traffic. they had previously faced issues from store thefts, bloated inventories and declining sales as shoppers switched to more cost friendly retailers. and this was all before tariffs took center stage. now target has cut their 2025 forecast as revenue decreases and in store shopping drops. adjusted earnings also came in notably lower. target ceo avoided saying whether prices would increase because of tariff pressures, but the headwinds continue to mount. a few brighter spots are growing digital sales and increased same day delivery. both full year revenue and earnings have been adjusted down and target has created a new initiative to address the challenges. but overall the macro environment and company specific challenges have beaten down target badly. edit: the amount of responses solely focused on dei are wild. many commenters don’t believe it had any impact on target. many other commenters directly are saying they stopped shopping on reddit because of it. and many commenters don’t seem to realize this is a thing outside of reddit and that a national boycott does in fact damage brand and sales, even if only a small amount amongst other issues
trump calls for end to $52 billion chips act subsidy program >president donald trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co. and intel corp. >“your chips act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to congress on tuesday. trump implored us house speaker mike johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.” >his remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the chips and science act less than three years ago. vice president jd vance, whose home state of ohio won a massive intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation. >the chips act is among the most significant us forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. it set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize american semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. the aim was to reduce reliance on asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers. >trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the chips act. that could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements. >officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the chips act as crucial to us national and economic security, and trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. dozens of gop lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law. >that includes south korea’s samsung electronics co. and sk hynix inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in texas and indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the us government. company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks. >trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on american soil. he has not offered additional details. >on monday, trump credited the tariff threats for tsmc’s decision to invest $100 billion in the us, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. he touted that project in his address tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “we’re giving them no money,” trump said. “all that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.” >a tsmc spokesperson declined to comment. >the company originally announced plans for a $12 billion us site during trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under biden. to support those facilities, tsmc struck an agreement with biden officials for $6.6 billion in chips act grants and $5 billion in loans. >as is the case for other chips act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as tsmc hits negotiated project milestones. the company received $1.5 billion before biden left office. >trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. commerce secretary howard lutnick said monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus r&d and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds. >“the main uncertainty is the future of tsmc,” said xin-yao ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “one long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. it’s completely different in the us if they are to shift more manufacturing. subsidies from us were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.” >tsmc is among 20 companies that reached binding chips act agreements with biden officials. the deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like tsmc, intel, samsung and micron technology inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of globalfoundries inc. and texas instruments inc. >companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. but some of them have worried that the trump administration could seek to modify the terms, bloomberg has reported. lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first. >that review is ongoing, and lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. so far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, bloomberg has reported. the current chips act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive. >a spokesperson for globalwafers co., which won $406 million from the chips act for factories in texas and missouri, said the taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the chips act as “unlikely.” >but if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating us market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the us.” **my take:** brutally bad for semiconductor sector if chips is actually repealed, intc is especially targeted. there'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the us (intc/tsm/samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current us chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember intc delayed their ohio plant to 2028?)]( the us would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. this also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (ionq/rgti) and ai sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors. overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the us has committed so far (but we don't know much about the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty. link: [

trump has threatened to place a 100% tariff on barbie maker mattel > president donald trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on barbie maker mattel, after the company's ceo said it would continue to manufacture outside the u.s. but would be reducing its reliance on chinese imports. "i've heard [mattel] said: 'well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' " trump said in the oval office on thursday. "that's ok, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the united states, and that's their biggest market." trump's threat to mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy. > trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers. > during the company's first-quarter earnings call, mattel ceo ynon kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three "mitigating actions" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on china-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain. in an interview with cnbc on tuesday, kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the u.s. due to the tariffs, but responded: "we don't see that happening." "we believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the u.s. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in america," he said. in response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer ford this week, trump said: "i think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me." > trump's remark on mattel "trying to go somewhere else," and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of china.

tesla investor survey shows 85% believe elon musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company more than eight out of every 10 respondents to a morgan stanley survey believe tesla ceo elon musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business. in total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. the majority of respondents also expect tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey. while a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and american politics. it also comes at a pivotal point for tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year. when asked about musk’s efforts with u.s. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact. on the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.” to be sure, morgan stanley analyst adam jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. he also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of tesla stock. the survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on tuesday afternoon. jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. in a separate question, 59% said they anticipated tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. what’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. that comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers. just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years. musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of president donald trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the department of government efficiency, or doge. the tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly. musk acknowledged in an interview with fox business on monday that his high-profile role in trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include x and spacex, “with great difficulty.” that day, tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020. despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220. after a new york times report last week unearthed criticisms of musk’s team from members of trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on tuesday. trump evaluated five tesla models parked at the white house after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support. trump also said he would declare violence at tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism. source: [
i thinks it's pretty safe to assume a recession is coming looking at the atlanta fed gdp growth estimates for 2025q1 sitting at -2.2% ( i think it pretty evident that a recession (2 quarters of negative gdp growth) is coming. even if trump lifts all tariffs tomorrow with the knowledge that even if trump lifts all tariffs tomorrow, the majority of supply chain issues and rising prices caused this quarter will be felt in q2. and trump lifting all tariffs in q2 is something that is not feasible, a more realistic bull scenario would be gradually removing tariffs until they're all gone. i think it pretty evident that even if deals are made, it's wise to prepare for a recession.
elon musk is running out of ideas to save tesla elon musk is dialing down his doge role that triggered protests and vandalism at tesla stores. but its ev business needs a hit product and none is on the horizon. and the company’s booming battery business, a q1 bright spot, will suffer from trump’s tariffs. the problems tesla now faces have been exacerbated by musk joining the trump administration as a "special government employee" — declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image. and they show no signs of disappearing any time soon, even if musk becomes a more active ceo again. worse, it's becoming clear musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, instead fixating on an uncertain future focused on robotaxis and humanoid robots.

tesla ceo elon musk bashes the $500 billion ai project trump announced, claiming its backers don’t ‘have the money’ > shortly after president donald trump announced a new massive ai infrastructure investment from the white house, “first buddy” elon musk tried to tear it down. “they don’t actually have the money,” musk wrote on his social media platform x. “softbank has well under $10b secured. i have that on good authority.” > trump said the investment will create a new company, called stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the united states. the leaders of softbank, openai and oracle stood alongside trump during the announcement. their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into stargate in the coming years. > perhaps it should not be a surprise that musk is going after an openai initiative. musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with openai and its ceo sam altman, who was at the white house for the announcement. musk, who has said he “doesn’t trust” altman, claims in the lawsuit the chatgpt has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced ai technology for private customers. the companies involved in stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don’t necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.

jim cramer made cost me 10 years of work edit: what i mean to say is that i cost myself 10 years of work by following his advice - my fault - obviously he did not hold a gun to my head. back then he was not a clown with a show... he was a fund manager just like the fund managers you see as guests on shows today (there was less internet and info back in 2000). many of his strategies crashed too fast to get out in one piece and he was still recommending to buy more when they started to fall. since then i have earned more money and invested in etfs slowly working my way to retired. my goal is to let younger folks chasing 10x at high cape know that the individual recommendations did poorly when the bubble burst but the etfs slowly and steady got to retirement goal. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- in 2000 jim cramer went viral with his 'only 10 stocks to buy/own for the future'. he said he was buying them every day, especially if they went down, valuations were old fashioned... they were guaranteed 10-20x. # jim cramer's 'only 10 stocks to own for the future' 1. **724 solutions** 2. **ariba** 3. **digital island** 4. **exodus communications** 5. **infospace** 6. **inktomi** 7. **mercury interactive** 8. **sonera** 9. **verisign** 10. **veritas software** cramer's choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole. by contrast, the same initial $100,000 in a passive s&p 500 index investment would be worth **\~$712,600** today. this is how taking jim cramer's recommendations made me work 10 extra years before i could retire (not hypothetical... true story). i'm just sharing my story because i see posts in this channel looking for 'guaranteed 10x' and i still see cramer fanboys... imho anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up... the true challenge is who can predict success over time. someone will say 'verisign' is/was great... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90% bad choices and resulted in a 50% loss over 25 years vs 700% gain if you ignored him and listened to boggle. young people may not think this is a big deal... but trust me... when you are old... having to work 10 more years is painful.
china is playing the us right now usd weakening. yuan weakening. treasury yields increasing. china is selling off us bonds (holds $800b+) and moving them into other currencies. this maintains their competitiveness in global markets while increasing borrowing costs for us and reducing their purchase power. the latter further increases import costs as now us companies have to face currency related inflation and tariff inflation. the net result if china continues is a choking of the us economy through stagflation. unless trump backs down we could be in serious trouble. this is the double edged sword of having us currency being the global reserve. if countries can manipulate our currency to strengthen it (as trump claims), increasing our purchasing power while making their goods more competitive to us econ, then they can also manipulate it the other way. powell is going to have his hands full with this one. keep your eyes on usd index and yields in coming weeks.

is it possible that trump’s tariffs are a massive pump and dump scheme? edit: i’m not an investor, just asking a question. trump controls the sec and doj, so who’s going to investigate or stop him? is it possible that trump, his family, and billionaire buddies are benefiting from trump’s tariffs? trump could be letting them know the date and time that he’s going to make the announcement to impose tariffs. like many investors, they pull their investments but, they have a head start due to their insider knowledge. then he lets those on the inside know that he’s going to rescind tariffs and the date and time which he will be announcing that. they buy the dip and profit as the market rebounds. rinse and repeat.
trump taps palantir to compile data on americans "in march, president trump signed an executive order calling for the federal government to share data across agencies, raising questions over whether he might compile a master list of personal information on americans that could give him untold surveillance power. mr. trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. but behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan. in particular, they have turned to one company: palantir, the data analysis and technology firm. the trump administration has expanded palantir’s work across the federal government in recent months. the company has received more than $113 million in federal government spending since mr. trump took office, according to public records, including additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the department of homeland security and the pentagon. (this does not include a $795 million contract that the department of defense awarded the company last week, which has not been spent.)" full article:
donald trump says us will set new tariff rates for scores of countries [from the ft]( president says washington lacks capacity to strike deals with every nation donald trump has held out the prospect that the us will set new tariff rates on many of its trading partners unilaterally, rather than striking deals with all of them. speaking at a meeting with business executives in the united arab emirates on friday, the us president said that washington would impose new tariffs “over the next two to three weeks”. he added that treasury secretary scott bessent and commerce secretary howard lutnick would “be sending letters out essentially telling people” what “they’ll be paying to do business in the united states”. trump said that, while “150 countries” wanted to agree deals, “it’s not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us”. not easy to tell whether this is going to tank the market or if it'll continue soaring like it has been off the back of the uk/china deals, which, to be clear, are still worse than before he started fucking around.

the era of american stock market exceptionalism is over nearly three quarters of fund managers think that us exceptionalism has peaked. the prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of us markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the bank of america’s latest survey. over the past two months, fund managers have dumped us equities at a record pace as president trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. for those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated. while it has come to feel like business as usual, us exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. in the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of japanese stocks challenged the us dominance of global markets. tom stevenson, investment director at fidelity personal investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s us market is particularly vulnerable to. one of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of deepseek, a sophisticated ai tool developed in china. the extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the ai moat of the american tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed. since 2012, average earnings from us stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, european and uk markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively. hugh gimber, global market strategist at jp morgan, says: “technology has been the leading sector globally and the us has been overweight in that sector. in an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.” however, the performance gap between the magnificent seven (apple, microsoft, amazon, alphabet, tesla, meta and nvidia) and the rest of the s&p 500 has narrowed of late. a year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the us market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. that is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026. the upset is apparent in other metrics, too. while the magnificent seven accounted for 50pc of the s&p 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025. all of this adds up to a simple fact: us equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past. in fact, mr stevenson warns they may underperform. markets are also becoming suspicious of us government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market. mr gimber explains: “one of the big parts behind the us economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running. “this has been an expansion built on us government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of us government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”
bloomberg: markets are discovering that the real trump trade is sell america two months into donald trump’s second term, the pillars of american financial hegemony — erected over the best part of a century — have rarely looked shakier. trump’s renewed tirades against the federal reserve, including the most explicit threats yet to fire chair jerome powell, only amplified the shockwaves from his declaration of trade war on pretty much everyone. it’s forcing a reappraisal of the assets fundamental to us economic dominance. the dollar and treasury bonds, traditional havens at times of stress, suddenly look much less appealing. it’s not long since investors were anticipating a so-called trump trade, essentially turbocharging us exceptionalism, but now it looks more like a sell-america trade. and that’s just part of an even broader and likely painful shift. the role of us households as goods-buyers of last resort for the global economy, and the american military as linchpin of security and political alliances, are being called into question too. compounding the concerns, trump is now escalating his war of words against the fed, demanding immediate interest-rate cuts. lawyers doubt he’s authorized to fire powell. but the damage to investor confidence in the central bank’s independence — part of the bedrock appeal of us markets, along with a wider faith in the rule of law — may already be done.

trump to tariff chips made in taiwan, targeting tsmc president trump plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on chips produced in taiwan, targeting companies like tsmc, which supplies apple, nvidia, and amd. the tariffs aim to encourage more chip production in the us, with trump criticizing the chips and science act for providing funds to companies that already have significant resources. the policy may cause price hikes for various computer products, as it takes years to build chip factories. tsmc-made chips are typically not exported directly to the us, but rather sent to other countries for assembly into consumer electronics. the implementation of such tariffs will depend on us trade officials.

zero ships from china are bound for california’s top ports. looks like the effects of the tariffs are being felt in the ports now rather than just rumors and pictures of mystery ships. "officials are concerned not just about the lack of vessels leaving china, but the speed at which that number dropped." i wonder how much of this is choreographed to coincide with the opening of usa-china negotiations this weekend. "not a single cargo vessel had left china with goods for the two major west coast ports in the past 12 hours. that hasn’t happened since the pandemic." i am not sure what level the tariffs need to be reduced to but i doubt 80% gets us back to full shipping lanes. even the flat 10% us going to feel like heavy inflation and affect consumer spending.

i'm predicting that trump's $100k h1b nuclear bomb is just a market manipulation ploy we've seen this before. trump drops a figurative nuclear bomb on friday afternoon, the media panics about it over the weekend, markets plummet on monday, and then he reverses course on wednesday and everything is back to normal. trump and his insiders make millions while everyone else gets screwed. this h1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. a sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. it's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the h1b. you're probably going to see tech and biotech stocks drop next monday, but you may as well make the best of the opportunity and buy some tech stocks in the dip.

does anyone else find it weird that the economy is okay? by "okay", economic indicators that the central banks and governments act on are all relatively healthy. * inflation is slightly down (could be showing softening demand) * unemployment hasn't really moved despite doge layoffs. many federal employees are being paid through september, but contractors likely didn't get that level of severance. the most concrete metric is scheduled containers at la port are down by 30%, which while bad, isn't that bad. it looks like companies earnings are going to be okay for this quarter. in terms of timing the next pullback, i think we could be looking towards the end of the may with maybe something in the second week of may?

some of you have completely lost touch with reality. i can’t believe how disconnected some people here have become. there’s someone in this subreddit regretting their investment in microsoft because it “only” gained 20% in a year. let me remind you that this is one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap in the trillions. a 20% increase for a company like microsoft is monumental! do you realize how much money that is in actual dollars? yes, i get it—crypto and nvidia have spoiled you with their ridiculous, lottery-like returns of 10,000% in a few years. but acting like a 20% gain is somehow “worthless” or not enough shows how distorted the expectations here have become. if you had invested $10,000 in microsoft 10 years ago, you’d be sitting on over $90,000 today—and that’s not even considering dividends or reinvestments. if you had added just $150 monthly to your position over the past 10 years, your portfolio would be worth hundreds of thousands now. that’s the power of consistent investing in real, reliable growth companies. microsoft is a rock-solid investment. not every stock needs to pump 10,000% to be worth holding. some of you need to take a deep breath and look at the long game, not just your short-term greed.

schumer says democrats will force senate floor vote on trump tariffs from: albany — democrats plan to force a floor vote in the u.s. senate next week to reverse recent tariffs imposed by president donald j. trump on imports from other countries. senate minority leader charles e. schumer told reporters in albany monday that he thinks democrats can secure the four republican votes necessary for the resolution to pass. “american families, restaurants and manufacturers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief if we can get that done,” schumer said. a similar resolution sponsored this month by u.s. sen. tim kaine, a democrat from virginia, wound up passing the senate after four republicans crossed party lines to support it. schumer is trying to repeat that result. the resolution would reverse the blanket 10% tariff on all goods imported into the u.s. by ending the emergency declaration trump has issued to impose them. it would also prevent trump from using the same declaration to impose new tariffs. “we believe the administration’s claim of an emergency is not justified,” schumer said. but the harder fight — and one in which schumer has no control — is in the house of representatives, where a majority of lawmakers would have to approve the resolution for it to become binding. republican leadership in the house, including rep. elise stefanik from the north country, has made clear that they don’t plan to stand in the way of trump’s tariffs. some lawmakers have offered support for his economic strategy. the goal of the tariffs is to pressure other countries into trade agreements more favorable to the u.s. while providing a disincentive for consumers to purchase products imported from other countries. “i strongly support president trump’s america first economic policies to strengthen american manufacturing and create millions of american jobs,” stefanik said earlier this month. stefanik is one of seven republicans that represent new york in the house, where republicans currently hold a seven-member majority. schumer employed a strategy on monday that’s been used by several other democrats from new york in recent weeks to apply pressure to republicans, framing them as the final arbiters on whether prices will climb because of tariffs. he called on the republicans representing new york in congress to bring his planned resolution to the floor of their chamber for consideration. “if those seven went to (house speaker mike) johnson and said to put it on the floor, he’d be under real pressure to do it,” schumer said. but at least one republican is siding with stefanik on trump’s tariffs. rep. mike lawler has said that republicans are focused on other actions to lower costs as well, like removing regulations for businesses and boosting domestic energy production. “this is about leveling the playing field, bringing tariffs down across the globe,” lawler said in a televised town hall earlier this month. that makes schumer’s request unlikely at this point, leaving the tariffs in place. they’ve already started to have an impact on certain industries, including restaurants, which may have to raise their prices to maintain profits. “tariffs on food and beverages will place an additional strain on restaurants, ultimately leading to higher prices that will be passed on to consumers,” said melissa fleischut, president of the new york state restaurant association. other industries also haven’t been immune to the tariffs. that includes latham pool, a local business that happens to be the largest manufacturer of in-ground residential pools in north america. tariffs on aluminum and steel have had the most impact on the business, said scott rajeski, the company’s ceo. “we’ve created an ecosystem where we use the canadian operations and our upstate new york operations to ship goods back and forth between the two countries,” rajeski said. “it’s a difficult situation.” both chambers of congress are scheduled to return to washington, d.c., next week after two weeks off from session.

pure market manipulation. so, futures dumped. pre-market dumps. the market opens and we continue to dump. we all know what's coming. "black monday". there are no dip buyers because nobody wants to catch a falling knife, and everyone else is grinning because they are short (me included). then out of nowhere, magically there is some "news". then the market does a huge reversal. word comes out that it's "fake news". the market then shifts back the momentum, but at that point clear direction is lost, algos are confused. traders are confused, and we just chop around. there is no doubt in my mind that "fake news" was put out there on purpose to stop the bleeding. and it worked. i think it was either a desperate move by the trump administration or some whale that was long and wanted to not get smoked.
us economy added 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in largest-ever revision > u.s. employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously thought, indicating the labor market may have been significantly weaker than initial estimates had suggested. the u.s. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in march than previously estimated, the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (bls) said on tuesday. the figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. the preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. the revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data. > the fresh data comes weeks after president donald trump fired bls commissioner erika mcentarfer in response to a weak monthly jobs report. trump claimed without evidence that mcentarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons. in a statement on tuesday, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said the unusually large revision cast doubt on the legitimacy of the bls. leavitt also appeared to grant credence to the data, citing it as evidence of a weak economy under president joe biden. "today, the bls released the largest downward revision on record proving that president trump was right: biden’s economy was a disaster and the bls is broken. this is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the bls’s data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions," leavitt said.

tesla (tsla) stock: trump’s purchase fails to sustain rally who knew that the publicity stunt on the wh lawn and a clear attempted pump wouldn't last. do not buy the dip! tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early march trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. this follows monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years. the electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on wednesday and 3.8% on tuesday. these gains came after president donald trump’s public commitment to purchase a tesla model s during a white house event with ceo elon musk. despite the recent uptick, tesla stock remains down almost 50% from its mid-december record high. the current price hovers around $245.75 in premarket trading.
this is why you don't try to time the market. you don't know anything, no matter how smart you think you are. unless you have direct insider info, you're basically cooked. us commoners will always lose if we try to time the market and everyone who held cash to try and 'time' the bottom just missed out on 7% gains instead of dcaing. they will probably still hold out on buying because market psychology is a ruthless. the most reckless people are those who unironically think they actually understand this mindbogglingly complex world we live in in all it's economic, social and political aspects. which is actually a large amount of redditors and people in general. instead of trying to perfectly time the bottom, dcaing and being within 5-15% of the bottom will always be better. it could very well still go down even more, who knows. i sure don't. the answer is no one and it for sure isn't some random redditor. in fact, usually the opposite of the general consensus of reddit/social media is what ends up usually happening from an anecdotal perspective of mine. point is for 99.999% of commoners like us, trying to time the market will always make you lose especially long term because you'll think you can do it again if you get lucky once. on top of that, the stress of trying to time the market with one giant lump sum is awful.
take back tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject musk $1 trillion pay plan a day ahead of tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance. on tuesday, a group that includes the american federation of teachers and public citizen launched a website for take back tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for ceo elon musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company. tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in september, saying the largest ever ceo pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock musk in for a decade. the plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month. on the take back tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because musk’s “political activities have damaged tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at tesla.” the site says the plan doesn’t require musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors. the site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. the coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf. “public pension funds are significant shareholders in tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “that’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold musk and tesla board members accountable.” additional groups in the coalition include americans for financial reform, the communication workers of america, corporate watchdog group ekō, people’s action and stop the money pipeline. tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. top proxy firms iss and glass lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested. following those firms’ suggestions, tesla wrote in a post that, “iss and glass lewis have recommended against tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 ceo performance award was introduced.” the company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from march 2018 to august 2025.” the delaware court of chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal. musk appealed the matter to the delaware state supreme court and is seeking to get the 2018 ceo pay package reinstated. around the time that plan was rescinded, in january 2024, musk wrote on his social network x, “i am uncomfortable growing tesla to be a leader in ai & robotics without having \~25% voting control.” the new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade. musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xai in march 2023, taking some ex-tesla employees with him, and was developing grok, a would-be challenger to openai’s chatgpt. by may 2025, musk said he was committed to running tesla for at least five more years. new york city comptroller brad lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same. “most of the time we’ve held tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.” lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of tesla, based on holdings reported in august. he said he views tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed musk to be an “absentee ceo.” the company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, lander said. the stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the s&p 500 and nasdaq in 2025. musk has “been an inconsistent ceo at best,” lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.” tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on wednesday. analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to lseg, following two straight year-over-year declines. source: [
switzerland has no tariffs on american goods. trump decided to hit them with either a 31% tariffs. the swiss government said it doesn’t understand how the u.s. calculated its tariffs. all swiss goods will be subject to 31% to 32% when imported into the u.s. that’s higher than other u.s. trade partners with similar economic structures like the european union, the u.k. and japan, the swiss federal council said. “the calculations of the us government are not clear to the federal council,” it said. the swiss government denied it had a trade surplus with the u.s. due to unfair trade practices, saying 99% of u.s. goods can be imported into switzerland duty-free. escalating trade tensions isn’t in switzerland's interests, the council said, and the government isn’t planning to retaliate against the u.s.

trump exempts phones, computers, chips from tariffs president donald trump’s administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock while benefiting electronics giants including apple inc. and samsung electronics co. the exclusions, published late friday by us customs and border protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from trump’s 125% china tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries. the exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the us. setting up domestic manufacturing would take years. the products that won’t be subject to trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. that would be important for taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co., which has announced a major new investment in the us as well as other chipmakers. the tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. the exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. the exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for china. one such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. he hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.

warren buffett sounds warning to washington as berkshire reports record profit, cash new york, feb 22 (reuters) - berkshire hathaway (brka.n), opens new tab on saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as warren buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the "short straws in life." buffett's admonition came as many investors worry u.s. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by president donald trump. the 94-year-old buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at berkshire's annual meeting on may 3. he nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to vice chairman greg abel, saying the 62-year-old abel has "vividly shown his ability" to deploy capital. "it won't be long" before abel takes over, buffett said. buffett's letter was accompanied by berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion. quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid. net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from berkshire's common stock investments such as apple (aapl.o), opens new tab and american express (axp.n), opens new tab. berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. the selling included apple, which remained its largest stock investment. "often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities," buffett wrote. 'fiscal folly' this year is buffett's 60th at the helm of berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors. "berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. and we are not finished," buffett said. buffett said berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily u.s. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967. he said reinvesting in berkshire is one reason the omaha, nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate america. buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, forbes magazine said, but he also sent a cautionary message to washington, lamenting how capitalism "has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever," with malfeasance by "scoundrels and promoters" in full force. he urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable u.s. dollar, saying "fiscal folly" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times "come close to the edge." buffett said long-term success of berkshire and the american economy, which he called the "american miracle," has depended on people's ability to participate. that, he said, is something uncle sam can encourage, or take away. "take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. they deserve better," buffett wrote, addressing the government. "and never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part," he added. cathy seifert, an analyst at cfra research who rates berkshire "hold," said: "talking about the business of america being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. he is warning washington: be careful where you tread." fewer buying opportunities while berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five japanese trading houses: itochu (8001.t), opens new tab, marubeni (8002.t), opens new tab, mitsubishi (8058.t), opens new tab, mitsui (8031.t), opens new tab and sumitomo (8053.t), opens new tab. other stocks appear pricey, with the standard & poor's 500 (.spx), opens new tab hitting a new high on wednesday and the nasdaq (.ixic), opens new tab just 3% below its december 16 peak. berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago. the company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the standard & poor's 500 rose 18%. over the last decade, berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, reuters data show. "they will have lots of buying opportunities but berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been," said bill smead, chief investment officer at smead capital management in phoenix. at berkshire's annual meeting, buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown omaha arena where he, abel and vice chairman ajit jain will answer shareholder questions. tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping. buffett told fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been "eliminated or greatly minimized." the meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by buffett's daughter susie. in discussing his age, buffett said he talks regularly on sundays with his 91-year-old sister bertie, using an old-fashioned phone. "we cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes," he said. "in my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face."

elon musk tries and fails to pump tesla’s stock (tsla) elon musk tried to pump tesla’s stock (tsla) by claiming a 10x increase in profits, but it failed. in fact, the stock is down 10% since musk’s pump. after an analyst posted a prediction that tesla would increase its profits by 256%, tesla ceo elon musk responded >it will require outstanding execution, but i think more like 1000% gain for tesla in 5 years is possible. the comment was quickly propagated by elon fans and the community of “tesla all-ins” as being a sign that musk, who is quite busy with x and doge lately, still believes in tesla. full article: [
trump aide says tariffs will raise $6 trillion as white house readies plan white house aide peter navarro claimed sunday that president donald trump’s new tariffs would raise more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade, a figure that experts said would almost certainly represent the largest peacetime tax hike in modern u.s. history. appearing on fox news, navarro said the president’s tariffs on auto imports, set to take effect wednesday, would raise $100 billion per year. meanwhile, a regime of additional tariffs — details of which have yet to be released — would raise another $600 billion per year, or $6 trillion over the next decade, navarro said. navarro’s remarks suggest trump is preparing dramatic new measures for wednesday, which the president has referred to as “liberation day.” navarro is known to be among the most hawkish voices in the president’s inner circle on trade, and it was not immediately clear if he was speaking to official administration policy or for one side of an internal debate over the tariffs. but navarro’s comments are sure to rattle markets amid intensifying fears about the global trade war that trump’s tariffs have started. also speaking on fox news on sunday, kevin hassett, director of the white house national economic council, declined to outline trump’s plans. hassett is widely regarded as more skeptical of tariffs than navarro. “i can’t give you any forward-looking guidance on what’s going to happen this week,” hassett said. “the president has got a heck of a lot of analysis before him, and he’s going to make the right choice, i’m sure.” tariffs are taxes imposed on foreign goods imported into the united states. a tariff regime that generated $600 billion per year would amount to the biggest increase in federal tax revenue since world war ii, according to jessica riedl, senior fellow at the manhattan institute, a center-right think tank. by way of comparison, the u.s. is set to spend roughly $900 billion per year on the pentagon this year. extending trump’s 2017 tax cuts is projected to cost roughly $4 trillion over the next decade, adding roughly $400 billion a year to the national debt. generating $600 billion a year in fresh revenue theoretically would cover the cost of those tax cuts and then some. but economists say new taxes of that magnitude also could deepen instability on wall street and further increase the risk of a u.s. recession, and experts are extremely skeptical the tariffs would raise as much as navarro claimed. the trump administration argues that steep tariffs are necessary to bring production and manufacturing jobs back to the united states. “the message is tariffs are tax cuts. tariffs are jobs. tariffs are national security,” navarro said. “tariffs will make america great again.” navarro did not disclose details of the additional tariffs coming wednesday, but trump [has in recent days revived the idea]( of imposing a single universal rate on all imports to the united states, regardless of the product or the country of origin. during the 2024 presidential campaign, trump proposed setting this flat tariff rate as high as 20 percent. because the u.s. imports more than $3 trillion worth of goods per year, simple math suggests that a 20 percent import tax on all goods could raise close to $600 billion in annual revenue. however, economists argue that such a tax ultimately would raise far less because the costs would be passed on to american consumers in the form of higher prices and consumers would therefore purchase fewer imported goods. in an interview with nbc on saturday, trump nodded to this effect, [saying]( he “couldn’t care less” if his auto tariffs raise prices, because higher prices on imports would encourage people to buy american-made cars instead. a universal flat tariff has been heavily criticized by economists in both parties, who argue that it would raise prices indiscriminately, striking even some goods — such as food and cheap consumer electronics — that either cannot be produced in america or make little sense to produce domestically. this month, treasury secretary scott bessent outlined a more moderate approach to “liberation day” that calls for the united states to determine a new tariff policy for its each of its key trading partners, leaving room for negotiations and dealmaking. but trump has told advisers in recent days that he is wary of being insufficiently ambitious with his tariff policy, and it remains unclear precisely what wednesday will bring.

uk and eu to defy trump with ‘free and open trade’ declaration brussels — britain and the european union are set to sign a formal declaration committing to “free and open trade” in defiance of donald trump’s tariff agenda. a leaked draft seen by politico promises a “new strategic partnership” between london and brussels based on “maintaining global economic stability and our mutual commitment to free and open trade.” it comes as keir starmer’s u.k. government is locked in negotiations with the trump administration to try to get a carve-out from the u.s. president’s new tariffs. the draft u.k.-eu agreement, dated april 25, is one of several being drawn up ahead of a may 19 summit, which is seen as a key moment in resetting post-brexit relations.

trump extends china tariff deadline by 90 days president donald trump has signed an executive order that will prevent high u.s. tariffs on chinese goods from snapping back into effect for another 90 days, a white house official told cnbc on monday afternoon. the order was signed just hours before midnight, when the pause on trump’s tariffs was set to expire. the delay was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between u.s. trade negotiators and their chinese counterparts, which took place in stockholm, sweden, late last month. source: [
trump announces tariffs → stocks drop → buys stock → pauses tariff for 90 days... what happens next bro. you can’t make this up. here’s the plot so far: trump announces tariffs markets instantly go full anxiety mode. stocks in that sector? dumped. volatility? exploded. retail? shaking. meanwhile, behind the scenes, rumors swirl that his inner circle is buying the dip like it’s black friday at walmart. fast forward to today: he pauses the tariffs for 90 days. like... bruh. the very thing that nuked the market — he just casually hits the snooze button on it. and what happens? shorts get evaporated. retail fomos back in. and the cycle begins again. so the question is — **what the hell happens after the 90 days**? do the tariffs come back like a sequel no one asked for? is this just a ploy to pump positions and then rug pull again? or is it just trump being trump, dropping chaos into the economy like it’s his side hustle? and seriously — **what’s the endgame after 90 days**? do the tariffs come back harder than ever? or does this quietly disappear once the cameras shift back to the campaign trail?--> make (people) losers again
elon musk tried to pressure norway’s wealth fund—a major tesla shareholder—to approve his compensation package [ recently disclosed text messages reveal that elon musk tried to sway norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the oil fund—to support his controversial tesla pay package. the fund, which manages assets of around usd 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in tesla, voted against musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish ceo nicolai tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends. in their exchange, musk also accused tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the oil fund’s investment conference. tangen countered that norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the u.s. freedom of information act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that musk would not attend. initially, the oil fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. however, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. the incident highlights the tension between musk’s calls for discretion and the norwegian oil fund’s legal obligations to remain open. while emphasizing a positive relationship with tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to musk’s pay plan.
nvidia hits $4 trillion market cap, first company to do so nvidia shares jumped more than 2% on wednesday, topping a $4 trillion market cap for the first time as investors scooped stock in the tech giant building the hardware for the generative artificial intelligence boom. the chipmaker is the first company to ever achieve this market value. nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, surpassing microsoft and apple, both of which hit the $3 trillion mark before nvidia. microsoft is also one of nvidia’s biggest and most important customers. the california-based company, which was founded in 1993, first passed the $2 trillion mark in february 2024, and surpassed $3 trillion in june. nvidia has profited heavily off of growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware and chips since the launch of chatgpt in late 2022. the company has positioned itself as the decisive leader in the creating the graphics processing units that power large language models. source:
consumer prices rise 0.5% in january, higher than expected inflation perked up more than anticipated in january, providing further incentive for the federal reserve to hold the line on interest rates. the consumer price index, a broad measure of costs in goods and services across the u.s. economy, accelerated 0.5% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. they were higher than the respective dow jones estimates for 0.3% and 2.9%. excluding volatile food and energy prices, cpi rose 0.4% on the month, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 3.3%. that compared to respective estimates for 0.3% and 3.1%.
chinese markets are rejecting tesla tesla’s dominance in the ev market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in china. according to a new report from cnbc, tesla’s sales in china dropped 11.5% this january compared to the same time last year. with china setting the pace for the global ev industry, tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like byd. it’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. in january, byd sold 30% more evs than tesla worldwide. the reason? cost and variety. while tesla leans on price cuts to compete, chinese brands like byd are already priced lower from the start. tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while byd keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. the model 3 and model y tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives. for years, tesla thrived under china’s policies that welcomed foreign ev makers. that era is over. the chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global ev race. companies like byd, nio, and xpeng are now the priority, while tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider. tesla’s shanghai gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. the chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken tesla’s foothold even more. elon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. it signals that demand is slipping. and tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. the competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating.
microsoft is cutting 3% of all workers microsoft on tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels and geographies. “we continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to cnbc. the company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late april. microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of june, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. it’s likely microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. in january the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. these new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. one objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. on monday, microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. they closed at a record $467.56 last july. source: [
trump is laying the groundwork to blame powell for any downturn [ it is unclear whether trump will go beyond haranguing powell to try to fire him. powell would likely fight such an action in court. investor faith in the u.s. could also be shaken. monday’s slump in stocks and the dollar and rise in bond yields might be a foretaste. that prospect has some republicans warning trump against threatening to oust the fed leader. “the president has already created tremendous uncertainty concerning international trade policy, forcing every business in america to figure out what his policies are,” said gramm, who chaired the senate banking committee from 1999 to 2001. “suggesting that powell could be removed through presidential action creates a whole new uncertainty.” even if trump doesn’t ultimately oust powell, his efforts to discredit him could do lasting harm to an institution that has long sought to remain apolitical and technocratic. “this is a real disaster” for the fed, said peter conti-brown, a fed historian at the university of pennsylvania. “the very integrity and buy-in on a bipartisan basis that the federal reserve is going to be a straight shooter is what gives the fed its authority, its maneuverability.”

coca-cola company (ko) shareowners reject anti-dei activist investor proposals coke (ko) shareowners last wednesday, april 30 rejected various right-wing activist investor proposals by a wide margin (95 - 99%). some of the rhetoric used in the proposals was downright insane: "first, the company appears to be all in on agendas that many americans believe are radical and leftist, including embracing utopian environmental goals, dividing employees on the basis of race and sex in the name of dei, and scoring 100% on the human right campaign corporate equality index, which has been described as a woke credit scoring system that promotes transgenderism." "but one would truly have to have one's head in the sand to conclude that the concerns proponent raises about esg, dei, and transgenderism are isolated and merely perceived by the proponent who happens to be a shareholder. note, as just one example, the growing list of companies and brands that have recently done an about face on one or more of these issues. the fact that coke can be so dismissive of these concerns is itself indicative of the need for the committee and report the proposal requests." "nearly all of corporate america has recognized that dei policies have become toxic and rejected by most consumers in the united states, but coca-cola still clings to these discriminatory practices. for example, coke's top competitor, pepsico, eliminated dei-based executive incentives, and we withdrew our proposal there." thanks for voting if you put in your vote. links: annual meeting of shareowners homepage: transcript of the meeting (pdf): final proxy vote (pdf): rule 1 disclosure: i am a ko shareowner. edit since i am seeing people in here talking about the recently circulating misinformation in regards to coke reporting immigrant workers to ice: fact check: no evidence coca-cola reported immigrant workers to ice

elon musk says backlash against his doge government cuts is hurting tesla stock tesla ceo elon musk said sunday that his involvement in the trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price. speaking at a town hall event in wisconsin, musk said his role with the so-called department of government efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock. “what they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and tesla i guess, to ... stop doing this,” musk said, according to bloomberg news. “my tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds tesla has gone, went roughly in half. i mean it’s a big deal.” shares of tesla entered monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in december. shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading monday. the drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said musk, who was in wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.” the slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with musk for his political work. protesters demonstrated at tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country. musk’s role in politics is not limited to doge. he publicly campaigned with trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the white house since the new administration took over in january. he also regularly comments on many different political topics on x, the social media company he owns. the ceo’s rising political profile comes amid signs that tesla’s core business is slowing. the automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in europe. in a note to clients sunday, investment firm stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for tesla. musk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for tesla’s struggles. other u.s. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the u.s. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the u.s., canada and mexico. source: [elon musk says backlash against doge government cuts hurts tesla stock](
ken griffin criticizes trump tariffs: says those jobs are not coming back from bloomberg. of course this billionaire actively supported trump and donated millions. somehow he never heard trump say over and over again that “the us was getting ripped off” and the best way to fight that was high tariffs? trump has been saying this since the 1980’s when japan was ascendant. “citadel founder ken griffin extended his criticism of the trump administration’s trade policy, saying that tariffs won’t bring back american manufacturing jobs the way that the president anticipates and the country should play to its strengths instead. “he dreams of giving people their dignity back, and i have to applaud him for having that dream,” griffin, speaking friday at stanford university’s graduate school of business, said of president donald trump. the dream of creating more manufacturing jobs, however, “is not going to come true.” “these jobs are not coming back to america,” griffin said. “and to be clear, with an unemployment rate of 4%, america has moved on.” the citadel billionaire, who earlier this week said the trade war has devolved into a “nonsensical” place, has warned that the us is putting its global brand at risk as a result of the tariff policies. on friday, he said the administration has embraced a transactional mindset that runs contrary to the best interests of the country. speaking as part of stanford’s “view from the top” series in silicon valley, griffin argued the us should try to play to its strengths, such as creating intellectual property and content, rather than bringing back jobs in factories that are rapidly automating their production anyway. ken griffin criticizes trump tariffs: ‘these jobs are not coming back’

tesla sales plunges 70% in norway, what might the future bring norway is a special market with almost 90% ev's with a market share of 18% for tesla, so in other countries sales will most likely not decline as much in the same period since oversaturation is less of an issue. norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if tesla is able to clean up their reputation. since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from march are published. some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered. **reasons of decline** * (stronger) competition * oversaturation of tesla, people want to have another car as the rest * customers possibly waiting for new tesla y * musk although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago. **conclusion and near future** although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in february, we might see a further decline. people that already decided to buy a tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. in norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new tesla y rolls out. in other countries sales could plunge the same as in norway. if the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for tesla. they'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock.

boeing shares fall 8% after air india plane crashes shares of planemaker boeing fell 8 per cent in premarket u.s. trading on thursday after an air india aircraft with 242 people crashed minutes after taking off from india’s western city of ahmedabad. aviation tracking site flightradar24 said the plane was a boeing 787-8 dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service. the plane was headed to gatwick airport in the u.k., air india said, while police officers said it crashed in a civilian area near the airport, without specifying whether there were any fatalities. it was not immediately clear what caused the crash. boeing said in a statement it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information. the news comes as the planemaker tries to rebuild trust related to safety in its jets and ramp up production under new chief executive officer kelly orthberg. boeing’s shares were down about 8 per cent at us$196.52 in premarket trading. “it’s a knee jerk reaction (to the incident) and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued boeing aircraft and boeing itself in recent years,” said chris beauchamp, analyst at ig group. source: [
the taco trade may doom the stock market today when trump announced the 25% tariffs on japan and korea, markets had a relatively muted reaction. even with the trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the s&p 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. the markets current reaction to trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his canada and mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. financial markets have begun to largely ignore trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. here’s the thing: trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire jpow, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. when the markets stop caring about trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for america. if the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. he will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. then, if earnings start coming in negative and the gdp shrinks, the market could crash again like on april 3rd. edit: not a bear. i own positions in voo and schd.

the wall street journal explains trump tariffs. i had a similar analyses, but this coming from most respected business paper should have more weight. (quote) markets are trying to figure out the implications of upending this system. here are four: more expensive stuff, and less choice of stuff. increasing saving means reducing consumption. the tariffs amount to the largest tax increase in decades, which counts as government “saving”—as well as pushing up the price for almost everything imported. higher interest rates. the capital inflows that offset the trade deficit help fund a big chunk of federal government borrowing. slash the trade deficit and the net inflow of foreign money dries up. bond yields will need to rise to attract domestic savers to buy treasurys instead of stocks or corporate bonds, which will hit share prices and raise the cost of borrowing for companies. lower stock prices. only a small chunk of foreign investments goes into building factories. if there were more foreign direct investment, it could finance at least some of the reconstruction of manufacturing. but we’ve assumed trump succeeds in shrinking the trade and current-account deficits, so there will be less foreign money coming in (remember: balance). so more foreign factory building means less foreign buying of stocks and bonds, so lower stock prices. a weaker dollar. in economic theory the dollar is the variable that moves when savings and investment don’t balance. if the u.s. saves too little to cover its investment, the dollar should weaken to make u.s. investments more attractive to foreigners. in practice the dollar has been in demand for foreign reserves and for use in trade, as well as a safe place to stash the world’s savings. all three are now being questioned: reserve holders worry they could be cut off from their reserves the way russia was, trade is likely to shrink thanks to tariffs, and investors are worried that u.s. law might no longer be the reliable protector of their assets.

the mar-a-lago accord - they are crashing the market and the dollar so i've posted around this paper by stephen miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [ he is trump's new chief economic adviser. guess what? the word "tariff" appears here 215 times. this is the plan. this paper establishes a regime where america is literally a global protection racket - "pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves." this has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday ezra klein's new episode dropped with gillian tett, a financial times reporter, and it is all about the mar-a-lago accord. it's not a name of some conspiracy theory. this policy paper mentions "mar-a-lago accord" as a thing: [ you are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. they don't know what to do. hilariously, miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it): >these policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the united states. efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. there remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “brics currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit. dionysis partsinevelos at msn breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing fort knox gold (that's why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and us bonds: [ buckle up.

don’t look at stock markets. look at the ports. the atlantic: key points: port of los angeles sees a 35% drop in cargo traffic: high tariffs on chinese goods have nearly halted shipments from china, according to port executive director eugene seroka. he projected a 35% decrease in cargo arrivals compared to the same time last year. ports handle over 30% of u.s. container trade: the port of los angeles and the neighboring port of long beach together process 31% of all u.s. shipping container imports and exports (17% and 14%, respectively), making their slowdown a critical national issue. wider economic fallout includes job loss and supply chain slowdown: 1 in 9 jobs in the los angeles region is tied to port activity. experts estimate a 9-12 month long recovery if tariffs are reversed today. as maritime traffic and cargo volume decline, the trucking industry and broader supply chain are also slowing, threatening small businesses and consumer goods availability nationwide. —————————————————————————- full article: by juliette kayyem a drop in maritime traffic suggests that the worst is yet to come. stock markets plunged for days after president donald trump announced steep tariffs on imports from around the world. the sell-off ebbed only when he suspended most, but not all, of the new measures for 90 days. the ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the port of los angeles, where high tariffs on china are crushing maritime traffic. “essentially all shipments out of china for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” eugene seroka, the executive director of the port, said on april 24. trump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the united states once had. but his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics. “these are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since covid,” evan smith, the ceo of the supply-chain-management company altana technologies, told me. “the tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” the port of los angeles, the busiest in the western hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the united states imports or exports in shipping containers. the adjoining port of long beach accounts for another 14 percent. over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. there are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines. seroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. at the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. the number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. a number of shipments now under way were instigated before trump’s so-called liberation day tariff announcement, on april 2. according to forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. the trip from china from california typically takes two or more additional weeks. in other words, the full effects of u.s. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time. the economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. early in the covid shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. the problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased. but trump’s trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, trump has already shaken global confidence in american economic-policy making. no one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. unless the republican-controlled congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effortso far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the united states could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products. tariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the united states. “less cargo volume, less jobs. that’s the rule here,” mario cordero, ceo of the port of long beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater los angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” peter neffenger, the former commander of the coast guard sector that includes los angeles and long beach, told me. “you don’t think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘i can’t walk.’” like the shipping business into and out of los angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty. this week, trump blamed former president joe biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on wall street. what’s happening in los angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much trump’s tariff war is hurting the economy. the stock market goes up and down. maritime indicators keep on sinking. ————————————————————————- 12 month possible timeline chatgpt (updated) here’s a detailed 12-month timeline outlining what could happen to the american people if the current tariff-driven trajectory continues without intervention: june–july 2025: recession declared, public pressure builds • recession officially confirmed as gdp shrinks in q2 2025. • unemployment rises to 6.2%; layoffs concentrated in logistics, manufacturing, and retail. • port of la traffic down 35–40%; national import flow craters. • consumer confidence index drops below 80. • protests begin in port cities (e.g., la, seattle) over job losses and inflation. • social media disinformation spikes, fueling confusion and outrage. • early signs of coordinated labor strikes in supply chain sectors. august–september 2025: economic inequality ignites frustration • back-to-school inflation hits 12–15%; families can’t afford supplies. • small business bankruptcies up 30% yoy; black and immigrant-owned businesses hit hardest. • rent delinquencies rise 25%, especially in urban areas. • local governments face budget gaps from reduced tax revenue. • street protests expand, including union walkouts and flash strikes. • isolated clashes with law enforcement reported in at least 3–5 major cities. • militia rhetoric and anti-government organizing increase online. october–november 2025: civil unrest threatens stability • holiday inflation hits 10–14%; shelves partially empty. • unemployment nears 7%, youth unemployment >10%. • mass protests erupt in response to perceived government inaction; occupy-style encampments reappear. • several cities impose curfews or call in national guard due to escalating unrest. • disruptions to public transportation and commerce in urban centers (e.g., chicago, nyc, atlanta). • social fabric frays: increase in thefts, flash mobs, and property damage. december 2025–january 2026: widespread social strain • winter heating + food costs overwhelm low-income families. • food insecurity hits 1 in 5 households; federal relief delayed. • rural and working-class frustration grows, with localized protests against both state and federal governments. • cyberattacks or hacking threats to state infrastructure increase amid anti-government activism. • police morale and staffing shortages worsen in high-conflict zones. february–march 2026: fragmentation & institutional erosion • sustained unrest becomes normalized in certain cities; protest fatigue met with radicalization in fringes. • voter trust in all branches of government drops below 25%, lowest in modern history. • recession continues, but recovery delayed by unrest, instability, and low global confidence. • militia groups, separatist rhetoric, and conspiracy movements gain traction, pushing disinformation. • calls grow for a national unity response, but partisan deadlock remains. this is a highly pessimistic scenario, but it’s modeled on how prolonged economic distress and leadership vacuums historically create conditions for widespread unrest—seen in the 1930s, 1960s, and at moments during the covid-19 pandemic.
trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports president donald trump floated the idea monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. in a truth social post, trump said the idea is “subject to sec approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” “did you ever hear the statement that, ‘china has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? not good!!!’” trump said. the wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. in a 2018 op-ed piece for the wall street journal, berkshire hathaway’s warren buffett and jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports. “in our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote. current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. the rules can be changed either from the securities and exchange commission or could be altered by congress. supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies. source: [
do not trust this market bounce yeah, futures are up, and it's probably going to continue to be volatile in the short term, but remember, we have not seen the worst of what is to come, not by a long shot markets priced in the tarrif news, and then, as nothing truly new came in(no immediate negative effects) it's bouncing a little. half thr country supports trump, and if they see no bad news they will be buying the dip. then probably thursday, if the tarrifs stay at their current level we will probably dip again, then we will partially stabilize and go up a little again. and then we will start to see the negative effects of tarrifs come in and the negative effect of the american brand being thrown in thr trash come summer, higher prices will be seen, places that rely on tourism will be getting hit hard, food prices will be going up like crazy, and companies will start to suffer. and all for this will happen when the american people have less money in their pocket, and less abilty to buy. and this will not be just for the summer, this will be a continous effect for as long as the tarrifs are up. and for probably a good while after be warned, most likely this is not over, things are not going back to the levels we saw before tariffs unless the trump admin reverses on a lot of things they said they will not reverse on, we will be in for some truly unprecedented times
due to the plummeting dollar, the markets are worse than they seem as it has been wildly reported, the us dollar is down 10% ytd, which means that stocks themselves are even less valuable. to help visualize it, look at this table: |index|1/2/2025|4/16/2025|change| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**s&p 500**|$5,868.55|$5,275.7|\-10.10%| |**dow jones**|$42,392.27|$39,669.39|\-6.42%| |**nasdaq**|$19,280.79|$16,307.16|\-15.42%| it looks bad, but if we look at it in euros: |index|1/2/2025|4/16/2025|change| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**s&p 500**|€5,692.49|€4,642.62|\-18.44%| |**dow jones**|€41,120.50|€34,909.06|\-15.11%| |**nasdaq**|€18,702.37|€14,350.30|\-23.27%| it is worse if we look at in gold, a common destination for one fleeing the dollar: |index|1/2/2025 (oz)|4/16/2025 (oz)|change| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**s&p 500**|2.209|1.573|\-28.77%| |**dow jones**|15.954|11.829|\-25.85%| |**nasdaq**|7.256|4.862|\-32.98%| so what this mean? i have no idea. i am not a forex trader, but this isn't a great image for the stability of the us economy.

jay powell made it clear fed is not going to rescue markets [ jerome powell delivered a clear message to markets this week: i'm not coming to the rescue. the chair of the federal reserve [used an appearance at the economic club of chicago]( to say in no uncertain terms that investors shouldn't expect changes in interest rates anytime soon or any near-term intervention in the bond market following turmoil triggered by president trump's tariffs. the key moment came on wednesday when professor raghuram rajan of the university of chicago booth school of business asked powell if there was a "fed put" in the stock market. and powell couldn't have been more explicit: "i'm going to say no." markets are "struggling with a lot of uncertainty and that means volatility." but his view is that markets are "are functioning kind of as you would expect them to in a period of high uncertainty." that seemed to pour cold water on speculation that the fed might step in to restore some calm in the bond market if needed. the speculation ramped up last week as yields on long-term debt [soared]( prompting predictions the central bank would need to provide some liquidity as investors unwound positions. powell said those markets remain "orderly" and chalked up the recent turmoil to "markets processing a historically unique development." what also helped is that the bond market did settle back down this week, easing the pressure for immediate intervention. this week powell also disappointed investors — and a us president — hoping to hear signs he was ready to lower rates as a way of preventing a downturn or cushioning the inflationary effects of new tariffs. the central bank will "wait for greater clarity" before considering any interest rate adjustments, he said, as he expects trump's tariffs to generate higher inflation and slower growth. *read more:* [*how the fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments*]( powell predicted a tough decision ahead for the fed as it weighs both sides of its mandate for stable prices and full employment, saying there is a "strong likelihood" that the economy will be moving away from both of the fed's goals for the "balance of the year, or at least not making much progress." if anything, powell went out of his way to hint he may give preference to controlling inflation, noting that without price stability, the fed cannot achieve a strong job market for a long period. and he made it clear he wasn't yet sure whether the inflationary effects from tariffs would be temporary or long-lasting. "tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation," he said, but "the inflationary effects could also be more persistent." powell also underscored the fed's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time price increase associated with higher tariffs from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. all of this seemingly hit a nerve with the president, who spent much of thursday lashing out at powell on social media and during a press event in the oval office. "powell's termination cannot come fast enough!" the president wrote on truth social. trump said powell "is always too late and wrong" and should be cutting interest rates alongside other central banks. at the white house later on thursday, trump reiterated he was "not happy" with powell and that powell would leave his position "if i ask him to." the wall street journal reported thursday that trump has for months privately discussed firing powell, but he hasn’t made a final decision about whether to try to oust him before his term ends in may 2026. powell has shown no signs of blinking. on wednesday, he again reiterated the independence of his institution and his own job, saying it’s "a matter of law," and pledged not to act in response to any political pressure.
cnbc: trade war fallout - cancellations of chinese freight ships begin as bookings plummet key points the number of canceled sailings of freight vessels out of china is picking up as ocean carriers attempt to manage a pullback in orders due to the trade war and tariffs. a steep decline in containers being shipped to the u.s. will have a big impact on the supply chain, from port to trucking, rail and warehouse economics. “we won’t go to zero containers, but we will see a decrease in containers and as a result, in the future we will see a massive raft of blank sailings announced,” one freight expert tells cnbc. the impact of the diminished freight container traffic to north america will be significant for many links in the economy and supply chain, including the ports and logistics companies moving the freight. if each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 teus (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage. booking volumes from the last week of march to first week of april across global and u.s. trade lanes plummeted. there were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. major product categories from china that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs.
we aren't in the dot com bubble. we're in an anything but cash bubble. tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up. the most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks. right now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly. so how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble? **right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash** this is due to a combination of usd devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration. basically whether intentionally or not, the value of the usd from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. this is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold. the result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss. in scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (ai). if you take a look at the sp500 outside of ai, you realize that growth is not very significant. non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation. **no one wants to be anywhere other than us equities.** for the past few years the chinese economy has slowed, the european economy mediocre, the japanese economy stagnant, and the russian economy in shatters. essentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose american first. people may not trust the usd or the government itself, but they do trust good old american capitalism and tech superiority. i’m aware global equities have performed well in comparison with the us economy in 2025 but what about the past 5 years or mag7? and yes at this point in the cycle there is some capital flight away from us due to the valuations but if america ever dips it’ll come right back. **in other words, this bull market, and especially the ai industry is so resilient because it's propped up by multiple reasons** it’s not solely ai being hyped over the moon or openai entangling itself with the entire tech industry. that alone does not create the market we’re in. we are in a triple bull market. now don't ask me when the music will stop. i don't know. although as long as us equities remain the best companies on the planet, cash continues to feel unsafe, ai keeps sparking wild expectations about the future, and global economies (not just looking at 2025 performance) remain relatively weak, i would not be surprised if a significant crash is unlikely. conversely if any of this starts to change, it may be worth watching.

regulators recall nearly all cybertrucks due to panel consistently falling off "u.s. safety regulators on thursday recalled virtually all cybertrucks on the road, the eighth recall of the tesla-made vehicles since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago. the national highway traffic safety administration’s recall, which covers more than 46,000 cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right sight of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. the stainless steel strip, called a cant rail assembly, between the windshield and the roof on both sides, is bound to the truck’s assembly with a structural adhesive, the nhtsa report said. the remedy uses an adhesive that’s not been found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement,” the nhtsa said, and includes additional reinforcements." ap story:

tariffs, doge and columbia — the market will crash because trumpism is not capitalism there is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. i think the bigger factor is that trumpism is not capitalism. this government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. one example: nih grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. these are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. they were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. it’s half-finished bridges. you can no doubt provide many examples yourself. if you can’t, ask in the comments. my point here is that under trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. the cases of columbia and maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. in both cases, trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the university (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. i don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but i’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). the threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. milton friedman, the famed chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. we no longer have those things. let me give you three examples. i have significant holdings in mrna, moderna. their mrna technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. they demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that rna vaccines saved over 10 million lives. this is a great american company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mrna vaccines from the trump administration. tsla was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when trump was elected because of the expectation that the ceo elon musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. now, it has fallen along with musk’s popularity. people realize that doge found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. to my point here, the value of tsla stock is entirely dependent on trump’s continued favor. if there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. if there is a falling out after trump finally finds it necessary to blame musk for the obvious problems with doge, then it will not. in either case, this is not a free market. finally, i want to mention boeing. trump personally announced on friday that boeing had been selected to build the f-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. so far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. i expect this contract to specify everything from who boeing can purchase parts from, to dei policies, to whether someone given the name charles at birth can go by chuck. trumpism is government regulation on steroids.
skype to shut 14 years after microsoft’s $8.5 billion purchase >microsoft corp. is signaling the end of the line for skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago. >once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and zoom video calls. when microsoft tried to stretch the skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to slack technologies inc. >microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. the redmond, washington-based company will offer skype users the option of migrating to teams, which is now its strongest rival to salesforce inc.-owned slack, before it shuts down in may. >“i’ve been at microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said jeff teper, a microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools. >microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users. >founded in 2003 by nordic entrepreneurs, skype at one time was owned by ebay inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when steve ballmer came knocking. the then-microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to skype’s internal valuation. the may 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by microsoft at the time, and skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age. >it didn’t pan out as ballmer would have hoped. upstarts like telegram, snapchat, wechat and whatsapp solved problems that skype didn’t. microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared skype, which found itself in the office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one. >by the time slack arrived on the scene, skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. they cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. the company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion skype in the mold of snapchat. >microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of nokia oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. alphabet inc.’s google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as chat and meet. and this month, amazon.com inc. said it would be winding down chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients. >the windows maker is shuttering skype to focus on developing new features for teams, including artificial intelligence tools, teper said. the company is working to infuse ai into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. it’s reassigning staff that had worked on skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, teper added. >at one point, skype played host to one of microsoft’s biggest ai demonstrations: a real-time translator. chief executive officer satya nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure. >teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” teper said, adding that microsoft wanted to keep skype running until it was confident that the teams version for individual users was fully ready. “it’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said. link: [ **my take:** thank god. zm might stand to be a major benefactor from this. msft already has teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like slack) and has failed. msft is citing this more as a doubling-down on teams rather than admitting zm has eaten their lunch here.
make it make sense tesla is up 9% today because of robotaxi news and "red tape going away" which benefits them (and google). meanwhile, google just smashed earnings and has a ton of profitable, existing products, and the stock looks like it's going to be red after that news. make it make sense.
so trump played art of the deal against jensen huang? what happened (chronological order): [trump administration backs off nvidia's 'h20' chip crackdown after mar-a-lago dinner]( [nvidia aims to build $500 billion worth of ai servers in the usa by 2029]( [nvidia warns trump curbs on china ai chips to cost $5.5 billion]( jensen spent $1 million for a dinner at mar-a-lago and promised that he would produce chips in the us in exchange for h20 export to china and trump agreed. then yesterday nvidia announced the production plan. today, trump banned h20 export to china. nvidia stocks were pumped and dumped. trump won all rounds against jensen and made money in stocks.
us dollar dropping from mid-january to april 21, 2025, the u.s. dollar index (dxy) dropped approximately 10.8%, falling from around 110.17 to 98.28. as far as i can see this is the largest four month decline in the entire history of the dxy since its creation in 1973. it even passes out the post-plaza accord drop, which was intentional and coordinated. keep in context that this is exactly a four month timeframe, but to be far that’s also because that’s literal present timeframe we have so far. jan–apr 2025 ~10.8% - trump’s tariffs and political pressure on the fed, global de-dollarization concerns. jul–nov 1985 ~10.2% - post-plaza accord (u.s. and allies coordinated to weaken the dollar) sep 2000–jan 2001 ~ 9.6% - start of dot-com crash; capital fleeing u.s. tech bubble apr–aug 2008 ~ 8.8% - global financial crisis buildup; fed rate cuts and recession fears. apr–jul 2020 ~ 4.1% - covid-19 stimulus surge; fear of inflation and dovish fed. we are in unprecedented times. so the question is “now what?” “what comes next?” in economics you always have to think about what comes after.
trump delays 50% tariffs on eu to july 9 >president donald trump said sunday that he agreed to an extension on the 50% tariffs on the european union until july 9. >“i received a call today from ursula von der leyen, president of the european commission, requesting an extension on the june 1st deadline on the 50% tariff with respect to trade and the european union,” trump wrote on truth social. >“i agreed to the extension — july 9, 2025 — it was my privilege to do so,” he added. >trump’s post came after von der leyen said that she had a “good call” with trump, but needed until july 9 to “reach a good deal.” >“the eu and us share the world’s most consequential and close trade relationship,” she wrote on x. >“europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” she continued. >the extension comes after trump last week suggested a “straight 50% tariff” on the eu, saying that the 27-nation bloc “has been very difficult to deal with.” >“our discussions with them are going nowhere!” trump wrote friday on truth social. >he later said that he was not planning to strike a deal with the eu before june 1, when tariffs were initially set to go into effect. > of course lol
trump open to tariff cuts in return for ‘phenomenal’ offers on april 3, 2025, president donald trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs if other nations offer “something phenomenal” in return, suggesting openness to negotiations despite recent tariff implementations. speaking aboard air force one, he defended the tariff strategy, asserting that the economic turbulence would settle and expressing satisfaction with falling interest rates. this stance follows the administration’s imposition of a 10% minimum tariff on all u.s. trading partners, with higher rates for specific countries, aiming to address perceived trade imbalances.
we're entering a system where disciplined savers get left behind back in 2009 during the global financial crisis, u.s. printed an insane amount of money and somehow managed to get through it. when covid hit, solution was massive money printing again. and it worked. markets bounced back, the system didn’t collapse. now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **printing more money.** it’s become a habit. a learned behavior. and honestly, the u.s. doesn’t even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore. they just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road. even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more u.s. debt while buying time. but at the end of the day, who pays for all this? **ordinary people who save money.** people who saves consistently through diligently and honestly everyday are getting crushed. just sitting still means your money loses value every year. in a world of reckless money printing and wild inflation, the only real defense is **owning assets.** index funds, big tech stocks, gold, crypto, real estate basically **anything they can’t print into oblivion.** the gap between fiat currency and real assets is only going to get more extreme. and if someone's holding cash, he or she is already falling behind. i love investment but i don't know this situation is sane.

many of you haven’t lived through a true bear market and it shows hell, maybe not even a bear market but a few years of flatness/minimal growth too. since 2020 we’ve had multiple swings in either direction and it appears that many have become accustomed to that. there’s nothing wrong with having 2-3 red days or a correction; one could argue that a correction is due anyways. it’s completely normal, and your portfolio will weather it out in the long run.
stocks are going up today because world's richest person bought his own stock! it is becoming a self full-filling setup. mr. musk buys $1b worth of tsla stock, which he is employed with, earned that $1b from tsla, and will get $1b performance pay from tsla. so, the same money is circulated. earlier orcl and top few companies teamed up to buy/sell among each other to boost their own stock evaluations. it is circular cash flow with in the top few companies. the result was an unbelievable 2 hour boost of 35%+ to a billion dollar company! since we have more information now a days than what it was 50 years ago (it was via news papers only), this type of sudden move is insane. is there any precedence to this situation and what to expect in the stock investment near-term and long-term?

trump's japan tariffs actually harm us auto companies, like $f and $gm. "now, the trump administration is touting a deal that will apply a 15 percent tariff on cars imported from japan (technically, it's a new 12.5 percent car-specific tariff on top of a 2.5 percent existing tariff on japanese cars). in other words, it will be cheaper to import finished cars from japan than it will be to import the steel, aluminum, and other parts necessary to build cars in the united states." this would be hysterical, if it wasn't so sad and destructive. i don't understand how this administration thinks people won't notice the price hikes. certainly doesn't bode well for rs in the midterms. meanwhile, if you own f or gm, you are probably going to have a hard time for the forseeable future.
the trump administration vs. jerome powell markets are sketchy, rates and tariffs are sticky, powell’s being hunted by trump administration... it seems that trump is adamant on sticking it to xi and waiting for his phone to ring, which we all know is not happening now that they stopped rare metal exports to the us. even trump knows this, as he's scraping the seabed hoping to find some metal deposits. in my opinion, jerome will also not be dovish to trump wanting lower rates, and will solely rely on the data. he doesn't care he's being hunted down. also, to make this even worse, cpi will not come back good. the dollar index will continue to fall, exacerbated by china and other countries dumping us bonds. currency devalue + tariffs will cause import costs to go up and push the cost onto the consumers, further raising cpi. it's a never-ending cycle. jerome will not be able to cut rates this year and i don't predict we see any serious rate cuts until trump can force one of his wwe goonies into the hot seat at the fed on may 15th 2026. good luck everyone, shit is about to get real...

volvo to cut up to 800 us jobs as trump's tariffs bite [ new york (reuters) - volvo group plans to lay off as many as 800 workers at three u.s. facilities over the next three months due to market uncertainty and demand concerns in the face of president donald trump's tariffs, a spokesperson said on friday. volvo group north america said in a statement it has told employees it plans to lay off 550-800 people at its mack trucks site in macungie, pennsylvania, and two volvo group facilities in dublin, virginia, and hagerstown, maryland. the company, part of sweden's ab volvo, employs nearly 20,000 people in north america, according to its website. trump has upended the global trading system that has been in place for over 75 years with a plan for tariffs on products from across the world. his vacillating trade policy has undermined consumer and business confidence, and caused economists to raise their forecasts for a u.s. recession. volvo group's lay-offs are the latest response from a car and truck industry that is reeling from the republican president's tariffs on certain parts, which is expected to increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles. "heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs," a spokesperson for volvo group north america said in an emailed statement.

trump trade war update: firm predicts 'empty shelves' and recession by june key points asset management firm apollo global management (apo) forecasts trucking demand stopping in about a month resulting in empty shelves and a recession this summer as president donald trump's trade war policies are bringing about changes in global shipping not seen since the coronavirus pandemic, with ocean carriers readying for significantly reduced demand, according to analysts and observers. specifically in focus: u.s. trade with china, amid the back and forth over tariffs and possible deals. the uncertainty has led to a decrease in shipping volumes from china to north america, with cancellations currently at 50%, according to global logistics firm flexport. trump announced his "liberation day" tariffs on april 2 and it takes about 20-40 days for container ships to sail to the u.s. from china, according to apollo. slok estimates that container ships coming to u.s. ports could come to a stop by mid may. it then takes about 1-10 days of transit time for trucking/rail to bring goods from the ports to cities. apollo global management predicts that by late may domestic freight demand will "come to a halt" and that there will be "empty shelves" with companies responding "to lower sales." by early june, slok forecasts there will be layoffs in the domestic freight and retail industries with a recession hitting the u.s. this summer.
the us economy is in trouble and i’m going to double down on puts tomorrow. i work at a big name casino and have noticed over the past 2 months volume is off a lot from last year. i also find myself unintentionally cutting back on my spending. today, me and my girlfriend wanted to go pick up something to eat and thought twice about it and just decided to stay in and have some leftovers from yesterday. i think even at a subconscious level people are cutting back because they’re afraid of what will happen in the near future. i’ve been bearish but now i’m thinking to double down on all of my put positions. might be headed into stagnation really soon.
why is tesla stocks not collapsing? (genuine question) hi everyone, i hope some of you can shed light on this question. i’m really curious why and how tesla stock continues to hold its value, given that the company’s sales are relatively low right now and its growth seems slower than expected. it also appears that the cybertruck launch didn’t go as planned, and elon’s increasingly controversial presence might not be the best for the company, since he’s such a key part of its marketing. am i missing something here? is there something i’m overlooking? (just to clarify, this isn’t coming from a political standpoint, i’m genuinely curious.)
byd jumps to record after unveiling 5-minute ev battery byd co. shares jumped to an intra-day record after unveiling a line-up of electric vehicles supported by ultra fast-charging that the chinese automaker says will allow them to charge almost as fast as it takes to refuel a regular car. byd’s new battery and charging system was capable of providing around 400 kilometers (249 miles) of range in 5 minutes in tests on its new han l sedan, chairman and founder wang chuanfu said monday. the manufacturer will start selling vehicles with the new technology next month.
is trump purposely trying to get countries to dump us treasury notes? after seeing the news today about t notes being sold at a discount it got me wondering. i don't know enough about the national debt and deficit and treasuries and all of that but it seems to me perhaps he's purposely trying to make our debt to other countries disappear at a discount. somebody help me in this logic and what would the ramifications be? we're talking about a businessman who has declared bankruptcy multiple times and still walked out as a billionaire. is he trying to do something similar with the us economy? i wouldn't think that you could draw similarities between the two since we are capable of printing as much money as we like unlike a private business owner. what are your thoughts? pardon my ignorance on this subject i just don't really know if it's possible or if it would even have any upsides or what the downsides would be? if it matters to anybody i have never voted for trump. i'm just trying to make sense of the madness because it only makes sense to me that there is some ulterior motive if this tariff policy makes no sense and how tariffs should or are normally imposed.
president donald trump says he’ll ‘demand that interest rates drop immediately’ thoughts? fed independence? this changes things quite a bit i think. if president can wrestle fed to start dictating policy, i think this changes the game considerably. it has been knows that past presidents tried in a way to influence the fed but this is done now openly?
tesla risks losing ceo musk if $1 trillion pay package isn’t approved, board chair says tesla board chair robyn denholm, in a letter monday, asked shareholders to vote for ceo elon musk’s nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company’s annual meeting. denholm said musk was key to the future of the ev maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on full self driving and optimus. “without elon, tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” denholm wrote. denholm told cnbc’s “squawk box” on monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront. “the opportunity for tesla in the future, given this ai focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said. several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor institutional shareholder services recommending against it. last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the take back tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand. tesla’s annual meeting is nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. et on nov. 5. tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines. the proposed plan for musk, which was outlined by the board in september, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to musk if tesla hits certain milestones. it would also give musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of optimus robots. “if we build this robot army, do i have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” musk said to analysts. “i don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if i don’t have at least a strong influence.” the full award would give musk, who already holds about 13% of the ev maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%. “he’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the ai,” denholm told cnbc. “so it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.” denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote. she also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect ira ehrenpreis, joe gebbia and kathleen wilson-thompson to the board. source: [
china rejects trump’s proposals for calls between leaders and foreign ministers. source: according to the wall street journal, president donald trump recently expressed his desire to speak directly by phone with chairman xi jinping, and the u.s. government also proposed a call between chinese foreign minister wang yi and u.s. secretary of state marco rubio, but the chinese side reportedly declined both offers. _____________________________________________________ i remain highly skeptical of anything trump says unless independently confirmed by the other party. as it stands, u.s.-china trade negotiations appear to have made little substantive progress.
this is a classic short squeeze pattern and i'm surprised no one is talking about it. it seems that very, very few people are seeing this for what it is: a *market-scale* short squeeze. 1. the market was well on its way to entering bear country, and a lot of short positions are sure to follow, particularly with firms that stand to lose the most with tariffs, such as aapl. 2. trump posts that "now is a great time to buy," prompting retail investors to flood the markets with purchase orders in advance of an expected announcement, driving up prices and making those with short positions nervous. 3. the announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking). this drives up prices even higher. 4. short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the china tariffs, such as aapl. 5. boom, near-record "gains" market-wide, even on stocks that should still be losing, confusing everyone. 6. the next day, those who took long positions exit to capitalize on their gains, resulting in a return to fair market value. this was a disaster for a lot of people. short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday. it was still a massive loss for investors overall. my opinion (not financial advice): i'd be selling any position i didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail. this president has no idea what effects his words have on markets, and is causing havoc that he's not even aware of. he *thinks* yesterday was a huge win, but in actuality it was a bloodbath for a lot of people. this was one of the biggest, if not the biggest short squeeze in history.
trump and xi held a call today - initiated by trump in latest news trump initiated a call with xi today and talked about tariffs. it has been reported in the chinese state media too. though taco has become a term to heckle trump on his tariffs reversals, this definitely seems like he is desperate. and since he has not posted on his beloved truth platform yet about this call i feel he has had no major inroads in the discussion with xi. traders have not taken the call positively and the day is bouncing between low positive and negative changes. **the market can bounce back later in the day as other variables (employment etc) are also in play.** or on the other hand the **market is now tired of swinging on rumors** (even if it directly from the mouth of trump) without valid direction. taco thursday as many commenters point out - i believe by the end of 90 days pause every day will be a taco day!! [ edit- here comes the **post from truth social** \- nothing concrete - initial few minutes had s and p 500 swing 0.2%. also the delay in his post - almost 3 hours after the call could also mean he was scolded/warned to control his rhetoric on social media and it thus has translated into a uncommonly decently worded update most likely even **heavily moderated** for language by china for all we know - **nothing burger** with a concepts of a plan of a location of a meeting- nothing concrete as it doesn’t say who from china will represent china - which means trump already had names prepped and china most likely said we will decide and tell you later) **i just concluded a very good phone call with president xi, of china, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, trade deal. the call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries. there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products. our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined. we will be represented by secretary of the treasury scott bessent, secretary of commerce howard lutnick, and united states trade representative, ambassador jamieson greer. during the conversation, president xi graciously invited the first lady and me to visit china, and i reciprocated. as presidents of two great nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing. the conversation was focused almost entirely on trade. nothing was discussed concerning russia/ukraine, or iran. we will inform the media as to scheduling and location of the soon to be meeting. thank you for your attention to this matter!**

stocks tumble into correction as investors sour on trump he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the trump administration. the move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from washington over the past few weeks. on-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on wall street. on thursday, the s&p 500 fell 1.4 percent. after weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a wall street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam. other major indexes, including the russell 2000 and the tech-heavy nasdaq composite, had already fallen into correction before thursday. the deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of mr. trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. that reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations. “i think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said kristina hooper, chief global market strategist at invesco. “that is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.” so far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. scott bessent, secretary of the u.s. treasury, said on thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “i’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said. as stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the trump administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term. seema shah, chief global strategist at principal asset management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.” the pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in december. the sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. the russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in november, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak. sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. the effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn. “so far in 2025, the u.s. economy has only faced headwinds,” ms. shah said. on thursday, mr. trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on european wine and champagne, one day after the european union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of u.s. whiskey and several other american products. the president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from china. the constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. on thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. on wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the consumer price index had briefly helped bolster stocks. investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. mr. trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called department of government efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown. “the outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and doge than the backward-looking data releases right now,” bill adams, chief economist for comerica bank, said on thursday.

why is stock market not tumbling after china raised tariffs? today china increased its tariffs to 125%. at this point, goods between the u.s. and china will cost so much that it's going to end virtually all trading between the two. that will be devastating and will increase inflation here, hurt many american companies that export to china, kill jobs, on and on. so why is today's news not hurting the stock market? it's actually up at the time i'm writing this. do folks anticipate that trump will back down and work a deal with china soon in light of this? is there something i'm missing? update: apparently there was both an optimistic jp morgan chase earnings report and optimistic inflation data (cpi) both released today that likely played a role.
when your ceo’s paycheck is the size of a country’s gdp so here’s the quick and *kind of insane* update on elon musk and tesla, inc.: * the board is asking shareholders to approve a pay package for musk that **could hit \~$878 billion to $1 trillion** yes, trillion with a “t”. * the catch? musk has to drive tesla’s market value up to \~$8.5 trillion, deliver 20 million cars, launch a million robots & robotaxis basically your wildest sci-fi business plan. * many investors and governance experts are *not* thrilled, they warn about dilution, “key person risk” and giving one guy unchecked power.
how will microsoft stock react to this news on monday morning - “trump demands microsoft immediately fire lisa monaco ...” lisa monaco is an executive at microsoft who served as deputy attorney general during the biden administration. “monaco has been shockingly hired as the president of global affairs for microsoft, in a very senior role with access to highly sensitive information. monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” trump wrote on social media. “she is a menace to u.s. national security, especially given the major contracts that microsoft has with the united states government.” full disclosure: microsoft is a significant part of my portfolio.
