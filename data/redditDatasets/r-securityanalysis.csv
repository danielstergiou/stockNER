Hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.

My   name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About   two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.

I’m a long-term investor. I   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the  book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I’m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  Smartsheet.  I’m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. One  of the best investment decisions I’ve made to date came  after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.

In   the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock   screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a  subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet,  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I’ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I’ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.

Another  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word “Smartsheet” mentioned in  the video and  said “Are they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?”. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said “My  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.

**The Thesis Statement**

For   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:

*“Smartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.”*

I  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet’s website and look at the  “About” page, you will  find their “About” statement which says  “Smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.”  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.

In   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let’s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let’s break them down 1 by 1:

* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn’t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.
* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)
* Wrike is private
* ServiceNow   – CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)
* Asana   is public but just IPO’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don’t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they’re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester’s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?
* Monday.com is private
* Microsoft – CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.
* Atlassian   – This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They’re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They’re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).

Now   that we’ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?

Well,   let’s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:

“Leaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.”

Key word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:

Asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.

Synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.

Any   communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called “The Power of Done”. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:

“According   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.”

They   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.

**How Smartsheet makes money**

At   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.

Before I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.

The  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That’s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.

For   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that’s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.

Smartsheet’s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.

Smartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.

The   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true “command  center”  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You’ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.

I think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as “Smartsheet  competitors” actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.

On  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.

Also,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company’s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.

Nobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet’s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company’s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company’s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.

As   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn’t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.

Here   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): “I have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,” said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. “The ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.

Lastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:

Subscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue

Professional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue

The main business of Yorkey is in the manufacturing and sales of plastic and metallic parts and components of Digital Still Cameras (DSCs), action cameras, copier-based multifunction peripherals, surveillance cameras, projectors and advanced TVs, etc.

The DSC market is a slowly dying business as mobile phones cameras become more advanced but Yorkey has managed to remain barely profitable with interest income mainly from property they own. The company derives a bulk of their revenues from Japan and the PRC. 

Yorkey’s latest interim report gives us reason to look at this stock. 

**Interim Report - Balance Sheet** **30/6/20 (All figures in USD$)**

**Non-current Assets**

Investment Properties: Acquired in 31 December 2016, Workshops 01-09. 26th Floor CRE Centre, bought for $6.3M. Unable to find any disclosed transactions at Cre centre and hence couldn’t get a gauge on whether they overpaid for this. 

However, let’s assume they overpaid and value this at = **$2.75M (50%)**

Property, Plant & Equipment: This is currently valued at US$5.1M on their balance sheet. As the DSC market is a slowly dying industry, let’s assume a worst case scenario and value their equipment at **$750K (15%).**

Deposits valued at balance sheet figures = **$390K**

**Total Non-current Assets = $4M**

**Current Assets**

Inventories ($2.7M) = Let’s assume their inventories are worthless and value it at **$270K (10%).** 

Trade and other Receivables ($7.76M) = **$6M(valued at 80%)**

Bank balances and cash = **$82M**

**Total Current Assets = $88M**

**Total Assets = $4M + $88M = $92M**

**Yorkey has no debt and total liabilities amount to** = **$20M** 

Thus, anyone can come along and pay **$56M** for a company with a book value of about **$72M in a worst case scenario** and get $16M for free. 

Let’s say in the past 3 months since the interim report was released, the company has suffered more losses in their business. I believe the difference between book value and market price provides a sufficient margin of safety as I have been fairly pessimistic in the valuation of the assets.

**Short Case:**

1. Market might know something I don’t, resulting in the low share price.
2. The numbers could have been fudged and the business is in worse condition. Management might be not be disclosing all information to shareholders. (This has happened before in 2013 but the old CEO and financial controller have been removed) 

**Catalysts:**

1. Yorkey Optical is a dying business, but the DSC market has slightly recovered and Yorkey’s business will recover over the coming years. I believe Yorkey will not go bankrupt anytime soon and will still be definitely be worth more than $56M. ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011_e.pdf)) ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011_e.pdf))
2. Management has also been buying back shares. 

**Additional points:**

David Webb, HK corp governance guru has also recently added US$35K to his current holdings. He is a 5% shareholder of the company since 2013 and has fought against the board for them to be more shareholder-friendly.

The past 3 times he has invested a similar amount to his positions, the stock has always revalued upwards in the following months.

3. One sector driving the bulk of market performance (e.g. Tech in 1999, Property in 2007, Tech in 2020)

I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. 

**The Situation and Company Background**

Affirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker “AFRM” and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. 

The company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 – 3% while APR ranges from 0 – 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. 

In FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. 

**Investment Thesis**

We believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm’s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. 

We also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm’s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  

Finally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.

**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**

[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. 

**Buy Now Pay Later Background**
Affirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the “buy now pay later” option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.

Affirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia’s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay’s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay’s estimates. 

Another key piece for Affirm’s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company’s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM’s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer’s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm’s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.

**Why Affirm?**

Although Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm’s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna’s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 – 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 – 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider.

**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**

Affirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm’s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna’s “Vibe” rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm’s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm’s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant’s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM’s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.

**The Bears**

Affirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay’s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna’s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay’s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna’s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay’s $11.1B AUD and Klarna’s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.

Affirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON’s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM’s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON’s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike.

**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**
[Still valued at $22B excluding PTON revenue](https://imgur.com/M5aoT3p) Source: My estimates from backing out PTON revenue contribution

**Valuation**

We use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT’s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM’s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.

[Finally, a more conservative sensitivity table indicates ~$73 valuation with a very conservative EV/sales multiple and lower 3-year CAGR assumption.](https://imgur.com/4FAtFHA) Source: My estimates

A lot of the software companies on the market today look incredibly expensive when viewed through a value lens and analysed using value metrics such as P/E ratio, price-to book etc.

But these companies are generally performing very well.

One of the problems, in my opinion, is related to how we think about profitability for high-growth subscription businesses. In a ‘value’ world, the more earnings/profit in a given year the better. However, with SaaS companies, it's the total profit over the lifetime of the company that matters. In SaaS, the majority of the revenue gained from an individual customer will come in the future, not at the point of customer acquisition/initial sale. Therefore, a SaaS company that is currently highly profitable is a company that can’t find good opportunities to efficiently acquire any more customers. If they could, they would be spending that money on sales & marketing since every dollar spent acquiring a customer would create well over a dollar in cash flow over the lifetime of that customer.

So, if standard value metrics don't work for high-growth SaaS companies, what does?

Are there any metrics that you use to analyse these companies that you think are particularly insightful???

One metric that i've found to be very useful is the Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth metric.

# Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth

Enterprise Value/Sales is one of the most common metrics you will see used to value high-growth tech companies. However, it misses the main reason that tech companies get such high valuations in the first place - their growth rates.

If you have two companies both valued at 50 times sales but one company is growing 60% per year while the other is only growing 20% per year, then you are looking at two very different companies.

When looking at the price of a tech company relative to its sales, it is critical to also look at its growth rate. This is where the EV/S/G metric is so useful.

The formula is as follows:

**(Enterprise Value/Revenue) / Revenue Growth Rate**

The closer to zero that a company gets on this metric the better. Companies with a score of over one are not doing as well and are not growing fast enough to justify their high valuations.

Let’s look at Zoom as an example (revenue and revenue growth are for the last 12 months):

**($104.36B / $1.96B) / 262.3% = 53.2 / 262.3**

**= EV/S/G of 0.2**

So you can see that even though Zoom is valued at 63 times sales, because of it’s exceptional growth rate over the last 12 months, it actually has an incredibly strong EV/S/G ratio. If it can keep up its exceptional growth rate (granted, that is a big IF), Zoom is actually undervalued relative to many other SaaS companies.

A company on the other end of the scale with a far less healthy EV/S/G ratio is Bill.com.

Bill.com has a relatively similar EV/S ratio to Zoom of 62.6. However, they 'only' grew 39.24% over the last 12 months. They have an EV/S/G score of 1.6 which is far worse than Zoom’s 0.2.

**EV/S/G for popular tech companies:**

Here is the EV/S/G score for 6 of the most popular high-growth tech companies, ranked from best to worst.

1. Twilio = 0.58
2. Crowdstrike = 0.68
3. Datadog = 0.69
4. Docusign = 0.72
5. Shopify = 0.74
6. Okta = 0.94

I'm trying to put together a list of the best metrics to analyse and compare these companies, so please let me know if there are others that you find useful. Would love to hear them

// Seth Klarman, the founder of hedge fund Baupost Group, has told clients central bank policies and government stimulus have convinced investors that risk “has simply vanished”, leaving the market unable to fulfil its role as a price discovery mechanism.

The private letter to investors in his fund, which was seen by the Financial Times, amounts to a damning critique of recent market behaviour by one of the world’s foremost value investors.

Mr Klarman criticised the Federal Reserve for slashing rates and flooding the financial system with money since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that the central bank’s moves have made it difficult to gauge the health of the US economy.

“With so much stimulus being deployed, trying to figure out if the economy is in recession is like trying to assess if you had a fever after you just took a large dose of aspirin,” he wrote. “But as with frogs in water that is slowly being heated to a boil, investors are being conditioned not to recognise the danger.”

The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount

US stocks are up more than 75 per cent since their low in March, while spreads on corporate debt — a measure of how much extra interest corporate borrowers have to pay compared to the US government — returned to pre-Covid levels this month.

Mr Klarman — who founded Boston-based Baupost almost four decades ago and has grown it to $30bn in assets under management — underperformed the market in 2020.

He has been intensifying his criticisms of US central bank interventions for the past several months. In the latest quarterly letter, Mr Klarmen referred to the Fed as an “800-pound gorilla” that has priced out investors who typically provide liquidity in moments of distress.

“The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount,” he said.

Mr Klarmen also said the Fed policies had exacerbated economic inequality, referring to a “K” shaped recovery that has seen “the fortunes of those already at the top bounding swiftly upward, while those at the bottom remain on a downslope without end”. 

Using Tesla as an example, Mr Klarman said shares in the “barely profitable” electric carmaker had soared “seemingly beyond all reason”, briefly making the company’s founder Elon Musk the richest person in the world. Low interest rates have made projected cash flows more valuable, he said, a point many investors have unwisely used to justify valuations on companies that sit far above historic norms.

“The more distant the eventual pay-off, the more the present value rises,” he wrote. “When it comes to the value of cash flows, the vast and limitless future, yet to unfold, has gained considerable ground on the more firmly anchored present.”

The Fed’s policies and programmes “have directly contributed to exceptionally benign market conditions where nearly everything is bid up while downside volatility is truncated”, he added. “The market’s usual role in price discovery has effectively been suspended.”

Mr Klarman said investors were now in a constant hunt for yield that was driving them to riskier corners of the markets, including investment grade corporate debt, private credit or junk bonds. 

The Fed’s drastic measures had helped to boost economic activity and rescue ailing businesses, Mr Klarmen said. “But they have also kindled two dangerous ideas: that fiscal deficits don’t matter, and that no matter how much debt is outstanding, we can effortlessly, safely, and reliably pile on more.” //","self","https://redd.it/l1snpi"

# Industry Overview

The biogas is released into the atmosphere with the decomposition of organic waste. This biogas (40-60% of methane and 60-40% of carbon dioxide and other gases) is generated by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter can be turned into biomethane (95%+ methane) that can be used as a substitute for natural gas. This means that it prevents the release of methane (one of the greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere as well as CO2 making a carbon-neutral loop or even a carbon-negative loop. A big plus for this technology is that it uses the already available infrastructure to distribute gas, making it more viable economically.

This is not all perfect since the combustion of this gas is still pollution. This raises the question of how much this investment is worth it since the technology can be considered ""polluting"" in a decade. The risk of such a scenario is reduced since there is no way to reduce the pollution from farms, wastewater, and landfills, making it the only viable solution.

The main driver of this business is the regulatory changes that encourage this technology. The de-carbonization is one of the main drivers of this business since it is very difficult to actually reduce the emissions of CO2 in areas such as farms and landfills.

[The industry is projected to grow at around 15-20&#37; per year. ](https://preview.redd.it/u0du9u2o1pc61.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c727d1cecea9d8d35a0063a4cfb169f05de1b1)

# Business Description

The business operates in the Renewable Natural Gas sector. It designs, overlooks the production, installs, and services a range of biogas upgrading systems using its patented water wash technology as well as other proven industrial technologies.

The company uses an asset-light model, meaning they outsource all the production. In 2019, approximately 66% of the Greenlane Biogas Group’s suppliers were located in North America and approximately 31% were from suppliers in Europe. The exact suppliers and their weight to the company are not shown.

They use all 3 technologies to process the biogas: water wash (the main one); pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and membrane. This is one of the ways that they differentiate themselves since no one else offers all 3 technologies.

As mentioned before their main technology is water wash. It has a low amount of units installed and yet it is the second biggest technology when it comes to the overall installed capacity.

[Number os Units Installed](https://preview.redd.it/uisrr7tu1pc61.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=018cebfe89f25969b6c34136fc0f3be3dbbcb6ce)

&#x200B;

[Total Capacity](https://preview.redd.it/nf2txszv1pc61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=81358a056d14f4746ed37862bcdeaf86630fdf5f)

Companies' main assets are the people and the patterns that they have. This is both their advantage and disadvantage. On one side they can expand at a rapid pace since there are no assets limiting them and yet on the other hand these models present much risk since their business is focused on production.

# Company's History

The company was created in 1986 in New Zealand with a focus on designing and building heat exchangers and gas compression packages. In the 1990's they started to install the upgrading systems using water wash technology (their main technology).

In 2014 the company was acquired by Pressure Technologies and renamed to PT Biogas Holdings Limited.

By 2018, over 100 Greenlane Biogas branded biogas upgrading systems had been deployed into 18 countries.

In 2017 the company restructured, moving from three regionally managed units into one globally operated company headquartered in Vancouver, Canada by Brad Douville.

In 2019 the company acquired their business (then called PT Biogas Holdings Limited) from Pressure Technologies for £10.1million:

* £2.0 million in cash
* £2.0 million in Special Warrants at a deemed value of $0.20 per share. They were converted into 17,418,000 Common Shares and 8,709,000 Warrants on August 9, 2019
* £6.1 million in the form of a promissory note. It has a duration of 48 months and has an interest rate of 7%.
* The PT Intercompany Debt (debt contracted before the separation) was outstanding in the amount of $0.7 million and is being paid in 9 installments.

In 2019 company entered into Integrated Biogas Alliance (IBA) that promises to provide customers with fully integrated organic waste to renewable energy platform solutions. This may be advantageous since they do not make the anaerobic decomposition facilities as well as any other facility that creates biogas. Thus these kinds of partnerships are very important if they work as intended.

In 2020 company signed an agreement contract with SWEN Capital Partners to create JV Co. This is a project that will help reduce the upfront costs of RNG technology installation in Europe. In essence, the company will create Special Purpose Companies where SWEN is the majority owner. The equipment will be loaned to the client that will pay it off in a monthly installment. At the end of the payment, the client will be the owner of the equipment. This will reduce the need for the huge upfront cost (2+ million) and as a result, will increase the number of projects and clients (in theory).

# Management and Governance

https://preview.redd.it/c3hclthb2pc61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a76ed2f9b5fe9ab8e048abc3bf9a04872e7dc487

Recently they issued new stock in the amount of 10,600,000 common shares at $2,17. The purchaser can opt for an additional 15% (1,590,000 shares) after the deal. This gives them a lot of liquidity but at the same time dilutes the shares even more.

One of the most worrying things about this company is that its executives are being compensated with stock options. This deludes the stock and incentivizes them to grow the stock price and not the company itself.

https://preview.redd.it/8evvfpfm2pc61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f4b7248a4d7e438461c159509ed480a38eb9fd

https://preview.redd.it/3cdrmn9n2pc61.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f7513501ea90a29e97c58279cad0e8584c0f38

The management cut down on the stock options compensation but raised a lot of the salaries. Since the company did not hire new personnel the salary rase is way too extreme. Something to keep an eye on in the future.

Management does own many shares in the company. It seems that they are keeping them after they are granted the options.

# Risk Factors

* The company has a limited amount of clients and thus the revenues are at risk. The acquisition of new clients is also a difficult and irregular task creating more volatility.
* The company relies fully on the suppliers for the manufacturing and installation of the buildings. There is no list of the suppliers and the only information that we have is that some parts are produced exclusively by 1 supplier putting the company in a difficult position if that supplier can no longer serve them. Long-term contracts can mitigate that risk and yet the company does not disclose any information about that either.
* Due to a large number of Warrants, the delusion of stocks is a guaranty.
* The company is still unprofitable and has some obligations, making it more difficult to expand its core business.

# Competitive Positioning

https://preview.redd.it/hyizpsvw2pc61.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8cedf084b046fc017b2af32cc38bf758e1fbe5

The only reference that can be found of the competition is done by the company so we need to take this information with a grain of salt. They do have all 3 main ways of making biomethane and so they offer a bigger range to their customers, however, they do not produce the equipment themselves and thus there is always a risk when it comes to their margins and their overall competitiveness.

# Financial Analyses

In 3Q of 2020 the results were:

### Balance Sheet

https://preview.redd.it/601ml7u43pc61.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a835f38b4ab2126b716ae509bb9ca78ba02a94

It is notable that most of their assets are actually goodwill and intangible items. If we take the goodwill out of the equation we will have total assets of 21,292,000$.

They do have a working capital deficit of 0,3million. This is mostly due to the promissory note that became a current liability.

Their debt is 1/4 of their assets and their debt to sales is (accounting for the last 9 months) 0,4.

However, they do seem to finance their expenditures and everything else with stock issuance. This may be fine for now due to high-interest rates for credit and yet later on this will need to change.

### Income Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/ri0rw0973pc61.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=da2296d361713f75eede57482075f246cc4b3c4c

Their revenues have grown by almost 300% for the 9 months of 2020 compared to 2019.

Their gross margin did not change and remained at 30%. Their operating margins are still negative and decreasing. This is likely due to more projects and no revenues due to how long the projects actually take.

As of September 30, 2020, they had a backlog of $43.8 million and a pipeline of $690 Million

The top 5 customers accounted for 11%, 11%, 12%, 19% and 22% of total revenue (75% in total)

The net income of 743,000$ is due to the reduction in debt to be paid in the promissory note. If not for that the company has a loss of approximately 1,000,000$

Most of the revenues come from the sales of their upgrading kits and yet a large part of their aftercare service is still not caught up to the rest. This can be due to the majority of the projects still being in the works but it can also be due to weak customer retention. They do not provide the numbers for that so we can only guess.

https://preview.redd.it/e849itab3pc61.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa613322639bf9ad79d25c47389b7fddc4f06e8b

The fact that there are no new projects in Europe this year is also strange. Their partnership with SWEN can be in jeopardy if they are not able to get new contracts in Europe. Most of the aftercare revenue comes from Europe with nice growth in the US and Canada.

### Cash Flow Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/qzz5in2g3pc61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=699a15ed2b51f7a1f1951e1174c2181dafd01040

For now, most of their cash flow is coming from financing activities such as the issuance of stocks and warrants as well as from stock options and warrants exercised. They are on the path to profitability and yet they are still running negative on operations. CEO said that at $30 Million they can start being profitable. There is still a long road to that but almost $50 Million in backlog can be a great start.

# Valuation

At 2,66$ per share and at a share count of around 140,000,000 (after recent share offering, warrants, and compensation) the total market cap is 372,000,000$ and the Price/Sales (considering the sales as their backlog) is around 8. With more realistic sales of $9-10 Million per year, the Price/Sales is around 40.

# Conclusion

There is a lot of growth potential and yet their competitive positioning is something to keep an eye on. Most of the risk comes from their asset-light model that has to prove that it can work. It already has a high valuation for an unprofitable small-cap operation. Honestly, I'm not sure what to make out of it. Seems like a great opportunity and yet not sure how likely they are to take advantage of the market potential that they have.","self","https://redd.it/l1zogp"

I am also not assuming but slightly preferential to the idea that as the rollout of the vaccination would allow for less restrictive lockdowns and retail traders will exit their positions to spend their money. If so from a value perspective (FYI I am not a value investor, although I believe in the ideals but my personal outlook on the economy doesn't follow value investing) most of them would say that equities are overvalued.

He chats in detail about the strategy in the podcast, but he looks at 40 of the top long/short hedge funds that he thinks are good candidates for replication, and he uses a model to reverse engineer what their aggregate asset allocation is. The model isn't able to figure out every single individual stock, but it can apparently get a pretty accurate sense of their long and short asset allocation which accounts for nearly all performance. The ETF rebalances monthly so it's a pretty up-to-date replication. The ETF has a 0.85% expense ratio, lower than hedge funds obviously but still high enough that it needs to work well to be worth it. [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4/episode/OWFmODFkZDItNWNlNy0xMWViLTk4OTctYjc2YWFhZTRjMzU5?sa=X&ved=0CAIQuIEEahcKEwiYrfnW07PuAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4/episode/OWFmODFkZDItNWNlNy0xMWViLTk4OTctYjc2YWFhZTRjMzU5?sa=X&ved=0CAIQuIEEahcKEwiYrfnW07PuAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg)

Most hedge fund replication strategies just copy long holdings of hedge funds that are reported in 13F's 45 days after the end of the quarter, which I actually also think is an interesting approach, but those strategies tend to have more downside than the market since they're just copying long positions without any way of knowing about those hedge funds' short positions.

DBEH has been around for 1 year now, and so far it's checked 2 pretty key boxes for me. I've attached 2 graphs here for each.

In the first graph, you'll see that its short positions gave it more downside protection during March/April 2020 than the market (blue line is DBEH and red is SPY in the graph below). It also dipped less than dividend growth stocks (orange in the graph) which are often used for defense.

[In March\/April 2020, DBEH \(blue\) had quite a bit more downside protection than both the S&P \(red\) and dividend growth stocks \(orange\).](https://preview.redd.it/1uq99tda9dd61.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=14bd8722e87d500300f863a3024471668c00fcac)

In the second graph, you'll see that DBEH has participated in the value rotation that we've seen since September. Blue is DBEH, red is the S&P, and orange is the Vanguard Value ETF. In the podcast, Andrew says that hedge funds concentrated correctly towards tech during the early days of the Covid recession, but also moved towards value correctly by mid-summer.

[Since September, DBEH has participated in the outperformance of value stocks. Blue is DBEH, red is the S&P, and orange is VTV.](https://preview.redd.it/b2r31x7cadd61.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2aee53e0add7fddc03d7301eed7a797f41b70ae)

As of mid September, DEBH was actually square in the middle of the Morningstar style box too, which makes the fact that it participated in value's resurgence especially impressive.

[As of 9\/16\/2020, DEBH was squarely in the large blend category, which makes the fact that it participated in value's resurgence especially impressive.](https://preview.redd.it/gylfadzwcdd61.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26b2f4e46bc75610ef06ef18698b735aef43c3)

Typically I'm pretty weary about newer strategies that haven't been tested for a few years and haven't been thoroughly analyzed by places like Morningstar. But in this case, I'm pretty sold on the approach - both for downside protection and as a good chance to participate in any trends we could see in the future, since hedge funds are free to alternate between value & growth and markets around the globe. Personally, I could see value or growth, US or overseas, outperforming in 2020, so I'm comfortable outsourcing these decisions to hedge funds for a portion of my portfolio. I plan to put about 5% of my portfolio into DBEH in a tax-protected account. There's a lot of turnover so I wouldn't suggest it in taxable accounts.","self","https://redd.it/l4ba77"

They are a *security company*. Revenue does not care about your AI driven autonomous machine learning EV car with DDs. People are using these terms loosely. A quick lookup for interviews with John Chen would prove that he explicitly avoids these terms as they do not define nor matter to the products/revenue of BlackBerry. QNX revenue does not depend on any of these terms, it's on installation on any device. This includes the space station, of which there is 1 of with obviously non-recurring revenue. Buying based on these basis would be gambling.

**Bull**:

* Business transformation: BlackBerry is now a software company, starting the transformation in 2015. The focus is security, the general term.
* 5 Products:  

   * QNX: Embedded system OS.  

      * Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
      * Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
      * Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
      * Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
      * Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.
   * QNX Hypervisor: Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization  

      * SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
      * Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.
   * IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.  

      * What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
      * Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
      * Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
      * Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
      * 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
      * Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.
   * Spark: Endpoint management. Basically API security. Did not delve far into this, basic info.  

      * Unified Endpoint Security: This is the endpoint where a laptop/phone/IoT device hits. It provides encryption and security around that. Continuous authentication is a part of it, where a device is learning the user behavior using ML and continuously checking if the behavior matches the original owner; if not, lock the device.
      * Unified Endpoint Management: Basically managing your API for devices.
      * Zero trust: I think this is specifically talking about continuous authentication. Basically, it's not an authenticate once and forget it. It's constantly tracking behavior to verify the user is the authenticated user.
   * AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system.  

      * Target customers: Government, healthcare, education, etc.
      * Solution: A communication system targeting non-enterprise businesses; specifically for Event management, cross organizational communication/collaboration, mass notifications.
      * Who does this benefit? You've seen the hacks in healthcare/educational/governmental sector. This is specifically for them.
   * SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).  

      * End to end encryption.
      * Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
      * Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.
* Customer oriented solutions: As you've seen in the products above, some products overlap and are just names to target specific customers. It allows customers to easily understand what product could solve their issue. Continuous authentication is a great example of this: Their customer complained that they kept re-authenticating, so they designed a solution allowing them to authenticate once and using ML they learned their behavior and can continuously check if the user is the owner/authenticated user. This kind of passion in leadership is good for business.
* Liability: QNX has the highest security rating available. Most CEOs want to avoid liability when it comes to security, using QNX would help them avoid that in a similar way cloud services help them avoid being blamed for hacking.
* Leadership: BBs leadership isn't one to play on famous words to drive the stock up. John Chen explicitly states this in his interviews and says they are a security company. Not cyber, doesn't mention AI or whatever. He explicitly avoids meme words and understands what the point of BBs business is.

Where I think growth can be made:

1. QNX in more cars. They can capitalize on the idea of less ECUs = less cost for OEMs + security.
2. IVY usage by OEMs along with QNX.
3. IVY ecosystem. Maybe application billing?
4. Professional services (support) for the products listed.
5. AtHoc increased market share in more governmental/healthcare/educational entities.
6. SecuSUITE for more enterprise customers with the idea being saving employers money from purchasing work phones for employees, and worrying about securing them.

**Bear**:

* Revenue: It is not yet based on a subscription/usage basis. You can only produce so many cars, and they don't give an insight on how much do they charge per car for QNX. Anywhere from $2 - $20 is what was mentioned in transcripts. This is a growth area, but not at a trajectory that's excellent. IVY does work on a subscription/usage basis, but IVY can be used WITHOUT QNX. I'm worried about this, but still see it as an area that will generate revenue in the range of $400 MM - $600 MM at the price of $20 per 30M cars. The 30M per year is based on the listing of their customers and their yearly production rates. Keep in mind I stated any device, this does not include trucks or other IoT devices.
* Market share: These are relatively new products. J.P. Morgan pointed this out as a priority for growth. This could end up not working out and growth never happens. This is a relatively low risk due to QNX and IVY providing SO MUCH value for car manufacturers Vs. other products in the market.
* Patent revenue: They sold a chunk of their no longer relevant patents to Huawei. This makes up a small (<= 32%) of their revenue and is a one time sale. The coming quarter could be equal or less to the last quarter revenue due to either other sales making up the lost revenue from patents, or coming up short. It could come higher if they sold more services, but due to COVID and knowing that many car manufacturers have lowered their production due to chip shortage, the next quarter will most likely be lower.
* VW.os: VW is making their own OS. VW.os is what they're calling it. They're currently using QNX, but that revenue could potentially stop. Personally I don't believe VW is capable of doing that. It's a marketing hype. Their companies are not capable of good collaboration or good implementation based on what I've read and researched (can't find article right now), but it's something to be concerned about.
* QNX success: While IVY could be using QNX, it does NOT depend on it. There is potential for OEMs to use IVY without QNX. I think this is a low risk, but still risk. 19 OEMs are already using QNX.
* Lack of Answers: I can't get much out of their earnings call. They don't delve into pricing for QNX, how they plan to grow it besides getting more car manufacturers and more cars post Corona. How they plan to do recurring revenue. A breakdown of each revenue segment would be helpful, but I don't see that either and there is hesitancy to delve into it.

**Prediction**: I think QNX can become a $1B revenue per year alone. $2B revenue per year as a company is not far fetched. Without a subscription/usage based model, it is difficult to see how growth can go beyond that. BB is good in 2-5 years, not this year. I can see their revenue growing to potentially $2B - $4B revenue per year. They did mention trying to figure out a subscription/usage based billing, if done then the revenue would be much higher. I think $18 is a fair price on the high end. It could grow further than that, but expectations would be HIGH.

As of writing this, HUYA is currently trading at $25. I think it's cyclicality can see it descend to $20, and I will enter a position once it is in that ballpark. This is a long term hold as the merger will take several months to complete and for the market to adjust accordingly. The potential short squeeze is just an added bonus. I will be working on a DCF valuation for the company in the coming weeks and will post that here as well.

HUYA Inc., ticker HUYA, is a Chinese live streaming platform. It is the APAC equivalent to
Twitch.tv and has a stranglehold on the industry there. HUYA is a subsidiary of Tencent,
one of the biggest and most prominent names in China’s economy and in global
entertainment, infamous for aggressively buying activist positions on Western media
companies and owning a significant portion of the world entertainment market share
through the subsidiaries it has purchased. Tencent’s majority in HUYA is controlled via
proxy with YY inc, ($YY). While directly being financed by Tencent, Tencent fronts HUYA
through YY Inc., which in of itself is the biggest streaming platform in the APAC region and
is a key player on the Nasdaq. With HUYA now merging with the only competitor in the
market, Tencent officially dominates and controls the live streaming industry of its mother
country, which will be maintainable through its deep-rooted relations with the Chinese
legislators and through the puppet war it poses, with HUYA and YY both being publicly
listed on the North American exchanges play-fighting as competitors, while in reality being
two of the same kin.

HUYA is the only member of its sector to be cash flow positive, while essentially being the
only peer at all. There are only two other competitors in the live streaming sector of China
and HUYA is in talks to buy out its second-most rival, DouYu International. The other
competitor, Tian Ge Interactive, is of no significance due it’s microscopic market cap and
consistent failure to generate cash flows. The merger is set to complete within the first half
of 2021, with DouYu integrating itself into HUYA’s capital structure and delisting itself from
the markets. This merger will bring HUYA to a monopoly sized level of market share, going
from 125 million active users to over 300 million when combined with DouYu’s streaming
platform. With its mother company YY actively participating in the market with a supporting
role, this now leads Tencent to having 600 Million users of the Total Addressable Market of
China. Assuming this platform will derive its users mainly from major cities and urban
environments, the total addressable market equates to the total number of Chinese citizens
living in densely populated urban area - which is 57% of the Chinese population. As it
stands, that is 798 million people. In short, Tencent will now own 75% of the Total
Addressable Market once this merger goes through.

HUYA shows income statement numbers on par with your typical growth phase company.
they are keeping a steady COGS, while aggressively growing net income, sales, and EBIT.
Currently COGS is 51% of revenue, but is down nearly 25% year-over year. Revenue has gone from $114 Million in 2016 to $1.2 Billion in 2019. Gross profit has grown from -42 Million to 318 Million in the same time frame. This gives HUYA a 3-year sales CAGR of 119%. There seems to be a steady trail of share dilution quarter over quarter, despite EPS showing no growth in the same time period. share dilution can impact future equity fundraising should it be overdone. sourcing supplies comes at an incredibly cheap price for the
company due to the intense monopoly of its parent company. It derives over 90% of its
COGS from JOYY and Tencent. knowing that it is in the best interest of one of the biggest
companies in China that HUYA sustains low COGS, high margins, and cheap equity
financing, this shows us the golden cog of this ever-growing machine. HUYA has direct 
access to whatever funds Tencent puts towards live streaming for the foreseeable future.
This reassurance has been guaranteed through the balance sheet so far, as the company
has taken a little to no debt since its inception and has in fact seen declining long-term
debt, going from $12 Million in June of 2019 to $9 Million as of June 2020. For a company
valued at $6 billion, this is chump change. 

In spite of this, HUYA is in the midst of an incredible short float, with 37% of the shares
outstanding being shorted. The source of this bearish activity comes almost entirely from
hedge funds and short-term traders on the North American markets. This is
understandable, as Chinese companies are incredibly shady and require much more due
diligence than any company in the West. However, this fear can be dissolved with help from
the Benford test. Benford’s Law is used to identify numerical irregularities in large data sets.
In 2014 researchers at Harvard and Columbia university aggregated all financial
statements by industry from the years 2000 to 2011 and found that approximately 83% of
firm’s financial statements were legitimate. Very few Chinese companies have successfully
passed the Benford test. Notable companies who have passed however include the likes of
Alibaba and JD, two retail titans. The test assesses suspicious fundraising, high gross
margins with the low operating expenditures, the liquidity ratios of the company, noticeably
low or decline in revenue, if the IPO was a reverse merger and if there is a considerable
lack of insider ownership (<5%). HUYA passed the test with the same exact marks as
Alibaba. 

Whether or not this short squeeze will come to life depends on the growth of the share
price. However, the company has been somewhat cyclical since it went public three years
ago. A major antithesis to the short sellers is the presence of Cathy Wood, the manager of
the famous ARK Invest, who purchased a significant portion of HUYA shares to add to the
fund’s product – ARKW. Cathy Wood believes HUYA will be an industry leader in the tech
and entertainment sector of the emerging APAC markets. 

Overall the aggressive profitability, industrial monopoly, upcoming merger, and nearguarantee of cheap debt and equity financing from one of the biggest companies in the
country, HUYA may be set to see incredible bouts of growth in the upcoming quarters. The
irrational fear of those short selling the company will be utilized by the market to drive the
price up to levels never before seen.

For that matter if you are a mega short seller of the above or anything else that is going stratospheric why not just offer the company new money and get the shares you need through new issue at a discount?

I think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached ""Facebook is evil"" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.

Facebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.

High investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)

VR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.

**Traditionally Listed Moats**

Intangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.

Growth of users means **network effects still growing**

Number and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**

**Competition?**

There is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**

**Messaging**

There can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone

**Misc**

I think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.

The integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.

Facebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)

The only other pure ""Real Identity social network"" is Linkedin is a professional network.

**Problems**

**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**

**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like ""Facebook sells data"". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**

**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.

**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**

**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**

**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things

**Might add more to this later...**","self","https://redd.it/l9hhf6"

One of the biggest joys of security analysis is developing research that anticipates accurately what will happen, or when wrong let’s one learn what you did wrong and how you can change your research. 

but I rarely get that here. 

We never see the outcome is of the research presented here and whether OP ever made an investment or opened a position based on their research. Perhaps some of these are school projects, or just random medium posts to send traffic to investment blogs, which is why a conclusion/update rarely gets reached on the DD.

Here are my thoughts","Discussion",0.9,113,0,0,91,0,"I have followed the tobacco industry for years, but never invested. At a minimum, it's a great history lesson (there's a good reason the [US capitol building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Columns) is adorned with tobacco leaves). The industry is the classic definition of simple, but not easy.

Clearly the industry has headwinds. It always has. Right now, they feel particularly existential in the form of competition from legal marijuana and e-vapor.

But COVID has changed the landscape. Volume leveled off for the first time in five years! As for e-vapor, it looks like more like the ability to navigate the regulatory issues will be the single most important factor for success. Clearly, Big Tobacco is in the best position to do this thanks to their seasoned legal teams and lobbyists. One thing is for sure, in the long-term, people will get their nicotine, it's just a matter of the form it will take.

The big three companies - Altria, Philip Morris and BAT are cheap. They trade at 10% cash flow yields with 80% payouts (which in this industry is arguably fine). They have plenty of cash to fund growth opportunities, which are going well, all things considered. While COVID has been a setback for Altria's heat-not-burn roll-out, it has been a boon for its combustible business. Meanwhile heat-not-burn is [20% of Philip Morris's volume](https://philipmorrisinternational.gcs-web.com/static-files/5c5df2d7-ebff-45bb-97d8-cfde31b5d206) already!

Therefore, it's hard to tell how much of the current price is a result of a) legitimate threats to the business or b) the rise of ESG, the ethics of the industry, and fund managers' unwillingness to invest in the ""death merchants"".

In my opinion, all of this reiterates the immutable fact of the tobacco industry - The oligopoly will persist, if not forever, for a very, very long time to come (long enough to return a lot of cash in the form of both dividends and [buybacks](https://investor.altria.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Altria-Reports-2020-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results-Provides-2021-Full-Year-Earnings-Guidance-Announces-New-2-Billion-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx)).

Had this question on my mind for a bit. One of my first trading mistakes was holding a leveraged bear etf overnight. It was SPXU , despite guessing the direction of the SP500 that day, I forgot to sell before end of day and watched all my earnings get wiped out. 
On the day that oil was worth negative monies last year. I watched DWT (now extinct 3x bear leverage etf on oil ) skyrocket from 11 to 40 a share practically in an hour. 


I’m still learning but was wondering , how does one tame these leveraged etfs ? What kind of use do they have for the average investor ? 

Thank you for your replies in advance.

The US/EU/JAP will be forced to artificially manufacture inflation to move clear of the Zero Lower Bound, they can't go negative otherwise people will just run to ATMs and hoard cash [bonus counterexample]","Short Thesis",0.73,16,0,0,49,0,"The Zero Lower Bound is also known as the moment when the rubber meets the road. Nominal Interest Rate on overnight deposits at the Central Bank and the equivalent short term government bonds  pay out zero, zip, nada, nulla...percentage wise.

Many people attribute the fact that we are at the Zero Lower Bound to the top down decisions of Central Banks. It is them, in fact which decide the Nominal Rate on overnight loans between banks to meet the cash requirements to be held at the Central Bank per the regulations specifically put in place by the Central Bank itself.

Reality is that the Central Bank is not God. It has very little room for manouver and generally +/- 500bps the rate of interest on short term overnight loans is approximately the same as it would be without its intervention.

So if it's not the Central Bank driving the charge and being God establishing the rate, then who is it? Well It's us! It's us with our behavior and how we behave with our finances, most importantly how much do we spend and how our expenditure creates inflation.

Inflation is the rise of prices as measured in the unitary currency of controlled by the Central Bank of the country being examined.
In the US the 2 indicators used by the Fed are the CPI and the PCE, those measure year over year, so when they are positive it means that there is, in fact inflation. When they are negative it means the phenomenon at play is deflation.

Inflationary and deflationary forces square off every day in the global and domestic economy to produce the result which is measured monthly by the aforementioned (CPI, PCE) indicators .

Now for inflation to happen there has to be a level of impulsivity which compels people to act on it and create a scenario in which money chases goods thus enabling vendors and retailers to rise the price. Matter of fact this is happening less and less and there are are some secular trends which favor deflation over inflation, they are just beginning to produce their effect upon the global economy :

1) Aging demographic, people become less impulsive as they age

2) Population (even young people) are increasingly risk averse compared to the past and you can see this everywhere, not only in finance, people live in the NOW less and less and thus are less impulsive, below some non financial trends

* a) Cigarette consumption is down

* b) Drugs consumption is down, especially stimulants

* c) Alcohol consumption is down

* d) ER visits due to bar brawls and domestic injuries are down

* e) Violence all around is down

* f) Sexual intercourses per year is down

* g) Number of female sex partners per male is down

* h) Age of first sexual intercourse is pushed in the 20s, whereas people would already fathered 100s of kids back in the Middle Ages

* i) You have 80 yr old people still buying 30 year govt. bonds investing ""for the future"" whlist they are literally about to die and become nothing for the rest of time

* l) Space is our frontier very much like the Ocean was for the people in the Bronze age....we have lost zero people in space, ZERO! And zero ships, that alone means we are playing it too conservative out of fear

* m) Finally I know i'll get a lot of flak for this but the lockdowns, honestly we would have never locked down in the 80s 90s 00s... for a disease which statistically trims a few months off people lives

3) The rise of platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, Trivago which eliminate price slippage and enable vendors to front run their competitors by lowering the price by a fraction of a penny. This eliminates holes in the price making, and enables the consumer to sort by price. Eliminating slippage and  price holes is a huge blow to inflation. We've seen nothing yet, e-commerce is just a few percentage of the total purchases in the US and it will reach 100% in the coming decades, plus **if you exclude platforms like trivago and fiverr we still don't have an Amazon for services, that would completely eviscerate inflation**.

Given that the rate of interest follows inflation/deflation this means that if left alone the interest rate will follow suit and head into the negative. 

**And here lies the problem, interest rate cannot go into the negative because people and companies would rather withdraw money from the bank and hold them in the form of banknotes which would NOT carry the negative component. That could potentially signify the return to the stoneage of Banking, the end of fractional reserve and the collapse of the financial system. Suffices to say that government will not allow this to happen.**

The big question which is also the base of the investment thesis being presented here is : 

**How will they avoid financial armageddon?**

**The answer is by artificially manufacturing enough inflation to move away from the Zero area and thus have the Interest rate follow suit and move away from the Zero Lower Bound.**

Note that this move is disconnected by monetary policy consideration and solely done to propel the financial system away from the Zero bound and contrast deflationary pressures which are still in the very beginning and have a lot of energy yet to unleash (think of deflationary pressures as an Cat-5 Hurricane which is only now forming offshore Cabo Verde and will hit Florida in 3 weeks time).

Also note that how is inflation artificially manufactured is not important , there are in fact various way of doing this, namely: helicopter money, QE for the people, stimulous checks, central banks monetizing government deficits and so forth.

**It's not important because the goal is always the same: inundating consumers with cash in the hope that they feel rich enough to start consuming again (acting on the impulse of purchasing again) and stop saving/investing (being fearful of the future and behaving in a risk averse manner)** 

So what's the play in the markets for the aforementioned scenario?

Government bonds carry a so called coupon, which is the rate of interest those bonds pay semi-annually to the holder. In almost all bonds (exception being the Inflation Protected Bonds) the coupon represents the nominal rate (not to be confused from the real rate which is nominal rate-inflation rate) . The coupon is dependant upon the prevailing rates which was in place when the bond was issued by the Treasury.

We've been in the proximity of the Zero Lower Bound for a whole lot of time after 2008, after a short rise during the Trump presidency COVID happened and we're back again at Zero.

This is a huge opportunity because all the bonds being issued by the G-20 Government since 2008 basically all have a coupon which is proximous to Zero.

As said earlier G-20 governments/Central Banks will be forced to manufacture some inflation and that would carry the Treasury bonds rate upwards as well (because savers would not bid over each other anymore for the privilege of lending to the Government at 0.25% because that would not protect them against inflation anymore)

What happens when inflation is manufactured and Treasury begins to issue bonds with a coupon which is more in line with an inflation which is rising (opposed to the strongest deflationary forces mentioned above)?

It means that the bonds issued 2008-present begin to look less attractive because they carry a coupon much smaller compared to the one of the newly issued bonds. When a bond become inconvenient to hold, people start looking for exits and buyers are hard to come by, in other words the price of the bond collapses 
(when the price of a bond collapses its yield rises).

As per the title says this thesis implies shorting bonds which were issued 2008-present because if the scenario outlined in the thesis is compelling, then investors who hold those bonds will head towards the exits and at the same time they won't find many buyers given that newly issued one will incrementally have a higher coupon to match the raising inflation manufactured by G-20 Governments and Central Banks 


.

Potential risks in the thesis: 

1) Central Banks actually go negative and banks manage to avoid passing the negative component to their customers. They get squeezed and on the brink of failure, but G20 governments keep bailing them out . The banking sector would become de-facto nationalized 

**Counter Example:**

1) Central Banks go negative and banks pass the negative component to their customers. But banking being so important for the global economy and having globalization completely taken over the economy, then people will swallow the pill of negative rates on their deposits . After all when you withdraw money and store it in the form of cash you can do nothing but a fraction of what you are able to do if you have money in the bank (even if you collect a negative rate) . You can't move money anywhere if not in the very close physical proximity, thus if you are an individual or a company your purchasing options would be limited at the physical proximity vendors where you can physically bring cash (in the form of banknotes) to and pay them with banknotes. Also you'd have to protect the loot as it's an open invitation for brulgaries .

So what's the trade for this counterexample?

It's the opposite, understanding that the Central Banks don't have to manufacture inflation to go negative, hence they will go negative by following the deflationary pressures mentioned above . So today's bonds paying 0,458% are a bargain compared to what's about to come, hence migth as well go long on them","self","https://redd.it/lblbvd"

I need opinions from people smarter than me.

NACCO Industries ($NC) is a coal miner that is pivoting their business away from coal mining and to a miner-for-hire fee-based management structure. Basically they let someone else own the land and take a fee based on the tonnage of material extracted and delivered to the land owner. This is a small but growing segment of their business making up a negligible amount of their revenue in 2018, 30% in 2019, and 31% through Q3 in 2020. This is a very small company with total revenues across all segments being $135m in 2018, $140m in 2019, and $105m for 9 months ending in Sept 2020. 

Currently, their main material is limestone which they extract from 20 quarries owned by 10 different customers. 

However, in 2019, they signed an exclusive contract with Lithium Americas ($LAC) to be the exclusive miner of the Thacker Pass lithium development in Northern Nevada. $LAC has been in the news a lot for the Thacker Pass project and it's stock is up over 300% in the last 12 months. The development is believed to be the largest lithium deposit in the United States and is estimated to have a little over 3 million tonnes of lithium. Last month, LAC and NC received approval from the Bureau of Land Management to begin construction of the mine. $NC is fronting $50m to build the mine which should be ready to begin production in 2023. 

In the technical report made to the BLM, LAC/NC estimated 300% growth in the demand for Lithium from 2017 to 2025 with an estimated price of $12,000 per tonne (prices now are between $9,000 and $10,000). The report also says they expect to extract 30,000 tonnes in the first 3.5 years and then 60,000 tonnes for the next 42 years (If we're doing the math, that's $360m of lithium per year for the first 3.5 years and $720m per year thereafter). 

Let's remember that they are only being paid a fee per tonne of ore extracted and those are numbers for the refined lithium. The lithium is estimated to have a concentration of .33% meaning to pull 60,000 tonnes of lithium, you would need to mine 18 million tonnes of ore. The details of the contract signed with LAC have not been disclosed so we don't know how much revenue to expect from this operation. This is where the opportunity lies, in my opinion. 

If we look at their existing limestone operation as a guide (those contracts are also not public that I could find), they extracted 10.2 million tonnes in 2019 and 11.6 million tonnes in 2020 creating $8.9m and $9.4m in revenue respectively. From what I can find, limestone is currently valued around $30 per ton meaning they received about 25% of the value as their fee. I don't think we can expect 25% but hell, even 5% of the value of this lithium would double the contract mining segment's revenue and increase the total company revenue by 10-20%. 

The big takeaway here is that we have A LOT of uncertainty. We don't know what lithium prices will look like, we don't know what the fee structure of the contract with LAC is, and we don't know what the costs of this revenue will be. 

HOWEVER. This stock is currently trading under 60% of book value. It's at a P/E under 7. They have nearly no debt and over $100m in cash (some of which is earmarked for the mine construction undoubtedly). The downside on this seems very small with an upside that looks very, very promising. The risks associated with the future uncertainty seems more than offset by the valuation. They've got cash, cash flow, and a growth story in front of them as they change the trajectory of their business away from coal mining and hopefully use Thacker Pass as a springboard to other major projects.  

Admittedly, I know nothing about miners or the materials industry. Am I completely off base here or is this a diamond in the rough?

edit disclaimer: I opened a small position in $NC earlier this week when I found it. I plan on increasing that position if it withstands further scrutiny so please poke holes in my thesis.","self","https://redd.it/ld7fuv"

&#x200B;

On SPACs:

&#x200B;

>See, how can I put this kindly? I can't, so I'll say it. The narrative, the story that we see around WallStreetBets, that we see around SPACs, the story is that this is democratization of markets, it's bullshit and the the people who are presenting that as their message are bullshitters. I can't say it nicely so I just had to say it that way. It is just, its another story, that's what Wall Street has always been and frankly it's what I think it will always be. \[...\] Do I like what Wall Street did in reaction to Reddit? To change the capital posting rules at the clearing house overnight, to give Stevie and Gabe and other guys a day to throw the ballast and trim their sails so they could survive? No, that's bullshit too. There's a lot of it to go around but what really eats at me \[...\] it's the mendacity of the people who say either ""Oh, no, its our liberty, this is the best of all possible worlds that we give all of our money to Ken Griffin"", or similarly its the people who say ""Oh, no, we need a transaction tax now, that's clearly what we need to do here"" or ""Oh, no, this is democratization of markets. And by the way come put your money into my SPAC or into my ETF of SPACs"". I call them raccoons. I mean they are huckster animals that financial services are frankly infested with. Always has been, always will be but by golly if you see it you got to call it out.

&#x200B;

In answering comment about people getting hurt investing in volatile equities;

&#x200B;

>A lot of people have been hurt but welcome to the world man and these people are not your friends. Right, these people are not your friends. You are being used, you are not being treated as autonomous human being. You are being used as fodder and that was clearly true in the GameStop. And look, we went back, we've been analyzing the language, the linguistics of what you saw on WallStreetBets and what you see is that about a couple of months ago the language changed, the linguistics changed. There was absolutely, absolutely, a planned effort, I liken it to the, I call it the snowball theory of markets, to start a snowball at the top of the hill and to be positioned for where that snowball could end up, before the avalanche could end up and trying to roll some snowballs down the hill. You don't know which of these snowballs is going to take off or which is going to click as a meme but you do it enough and one of them is going to click and this democratization, you know, to the moon, diamond hands, stick it to the man by buying GameStop calls. This was absolutely a plan, it didn't happen organically and it sure ain't part of some democratic uprising. 

&#x200B;

Finally, answer to the question what is the meta narrative that country most needs to grapple with, most needs to understand and most needs to digest in order to get to a view of reality that corresponds to their model;

&#x200B;

>I think the most important thing, and I'll use a poker analogy here, you know the old line that if you don't know who the sucker is at the table after 30 minutes, it's you. The important thing here is not to stop plying poker, not to say ""Oh my god, the game is rigged and I'm out of here"", it's not to get off the grid and, you know, live out in the wilds of Alaska. The important thing here is to preserve some distance in your mind and in your heart between yourself and what you are told. To recognize that everything in markets and everything in politics is somebody shaking their finger at you and trying to tell you how to think about the world, what multiple should you put on this, what is the story we are going to put around the markets or this election or what have you. And its not to say you don't act in markets and elections. You vote, you invest, you do all that but you don't take these stories into your heart. You maintain a critical distance so that you maintain your autonomy of mind. If there's one message out here, its to do that. To think critically about everything you are reading here.

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering the largest defense contractor in the United States; Lockheed Martin (LMT). This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so sorry in advance if it's dense.

**Business**

Lockheed Martin is a well-known federal defense contractor. Lockheed is responsible for some of the most storied and powerful fighter jets in the world such as the F-16, the C-130J Hercules, the F-35, and many more. They're also a very influential missile producer with offerings including the PAC-3 system, the THAAD System, the Javelin Missile, and the Hellfire Missile.

Lockheed gets 74% of its revenue comes from the US government, 25% of its revenue from international governments and 1% was from commercial and other customers.

Their operations can be broken up into 4 distinct segments: Aeronautics (40% of revenue), Rotary and Mission Systems (25% of revenue), Missiles & Fire Control (17% of revenue), and Space (18% of revenue). Let's take a closer look at these segments.

**Aeronautics**

This segment includes advanced military aircraft and unmanned drone production. This is probably Lockheed's most storied segment and is where a majority of people know them from. The F-35 program made up over 69% of the aeronautics segment's net sales in 2020 and is the crown jewel of Lockheed Martin's aerospace offerings. Production of the F-35 is expected to continue for a long time given the US government's inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft, commitments from 6 other international governments, and interest from other countries.

The drone part of this segment is very promising. Drone spending is expected to have a CAGR of 19.8% through 2023, and seeing as Lockheed is the largest drone producer in the US, they stand to benefit significantly.

In 2020, Lockheed Martin delivered 120 aircraft including 46 to international governments. This segment got 69% of its revenue from US government customers and 31% of its revenue from international governments.

**Missiles and Fire Control**

This segment provides air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, and ground precision strike weapons. Some of their famous offerings include the Patriot Advanced Capability system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. They also have some more cutting-edge (and expensive) offerings such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the Infrared Search and Track fire control system.

**Rotary and Mission Systems**

This segment provides commercial helicopters, surface ships, radar systems, cyber solutions, and simulation systems. This segment got 72% of its revenue from the US government, 25% came from international governments, and 3% came from commercial customers.

**Space**

This is the segment we know the least about as a lot of its operations are classified. The main customers of this segment are the US Air Force, the US Navy, and the National Guard. The US government accounted for 87% of revenues and the rest came from international customers.

This segment produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. One of the largest programs in this segment is the Trident II D5 Flett Ballistic Missle, the Space-Based Infrared System, and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. I can see massive tailwinds making this a very profitable segment.

**Revenues**

Lockheed brought in revenue of $65.398 Billion in 2020, a 9.34% gain YoY, a 30.88% gain from 3 years ago, and a 61.33% gain from 5 years. I think these numbers are absolutely staggering considering the performance of other Aerospace companies this year (Raytheon's revenue contracted 26.55% YoY and General Dynamic's revenue declined  3.62% YoY).

Switching over to COGS, we have COGS of $56.744 Billion in 2020, an 8.82% gain YoY, a 30.90% growth from 3 years ago, and a 57.49% growth from 5 years ago. While these increases may seem large, I'd argue that in the Aerospace industry, it's only natural that COGS growth will follow revenue growth. The only thing I'd want to see when it comes to this is revenue growth outpacing COGS growth which it has in Lockheed's case.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we see a 2020 total of $6.833 Billion, a 9.63% gain YoY and a 112.04% gain from 5 years ago (I left out 3-year growth because they had just spun-off a company meaning we get a growth rate of 248.46%).

**Margins**

Lockheed Martin currently has a net margin of 10.45%. Their net margin has expanded by 17.54% in the last 5 years. Comparing this margin to their peers, Raytheon is currently operating at a -5.55% net margin and General Dynamics is operating at an 8.35% margin.

**Cash On Hand/Debt**

Lockheed Martin currently has cash on hand of 3.16 Billion, representing an increase of over 108% YoY. The amount of cash they've stockpiled makes me think they may be gearing up for an acquisition, or (much more likely) continuing to pay done debt.

Speaking of debt, Lockheed Martin has been paying down debt significantly for the last 5 years. They've shrunken debt by 18.42% in the last 5 years and 13.64% in the last 3 years.

**Free Cash Flow**

Lockheed Martin has had a growing FCF for a while now. In the last 3 years, they've grown FCF by 41.22%, and grown it by 92.88% from 5 years ago.

**Dividends**

One of the most surprising things I found about Lockheed is its dividends. Lockheed currently pays a 2.99% annual dividend ($2.60 quarterly) that they've grown for 18 consecutive years. In the last 5 years, they've grown the dividend by 59.34% and maintain a payout ratio of 40.75%.

For me, the fact that they pay such a hefty and sustainable quarterly dividend was just an affirmation that Lockheed has been undervalued by the market.

**Price Ratios/Other**

Lockheed has a TTM PE of 13.24x. This compares well with the current average industrials PE of \~32x. Considering the growth rates we've observed in the last 3-5 years, I feel like this is a pretty low PE, although I recognize the short-comings and general unreliability of the PE ratio when it comes to valuation.

What I find really interesting about Lockheed is just how efficient they are at generating capital. They have an ROE of **149.38%!** This number is even more insane when you consider their peers' ROEs. Raytheon has an ROE of -5.53%, General Dynamics has an ROE of 23.00% and Northrop Grumman has an ROE of 32.03%.

**Conclusion**

I'm really bullish on Lockheed. I think they've been undervalued by the market just because they're a member of a sector with some laggards. That being said, I would love to hear some second opinions as I'm not as experienced as many of you are.","self","https://redd.it/lefmsf"

**SQBG - Sequential Brands Group**

Current Market Cap: 27M

Share Price: 16.31

\*\*\*Note: this is a very leveraged company in an out of favor industry\*\*\*

**Introduction**

Sequential Brands Group is a brand management company that licenses several apparel and shoe brands to wholesalers and some d2c sellers. These brands are mostly sold at major big box brick and mortar retailers and Amazon. Some brands include: Jessica Simpson, AND1, AVIA, Ellen Tracy and GAIAM. Large shareholders include Chairman William Sweedler and Martha Stewart. The company is heavily leveraged (450M) and has seen its share price suffer over the last several years. 

**Why spend time on this equity stub?**

Near term catalyst. The company has aggressively reduced costs and has packaged itself for sale.

**Recent history**

In mid 2019 SQBG sold its home division, which included the Martha Stewart Living and Emiril Legassi brands. It later announced a focus on cost reductions. This consisted primarily of examining lease expenses and headcount reduction. Prior to the sale of the home division, operating expenses were \~70M and the stated long term goal was 30M. In later 2019, an announcement stating exploration of strategic alternatives was made. This was in response to receiving unsolicited interest in some of their brands. Ultimately, no sale transpired and the share price expectedly suffered greatly.

2020 was very difficult for anyone relying on brick and mortar sales. A few highlights from SQBG: 

3/20 - Company started working with a lender (Wilmington Trust) due to inability to comply with certain covenants. These were waived until the end of the year. 

3/20 - Took asset impairment charge on brand value   
11/20 - CEO and CFO left the company. Chairman William Sweedler (13% shareholder) is filling a “Principle Executive Officer” role and an interim CFO has joined. She has experience in M&A and is hired temporarily.  CEO position will not be filled.

11/20 - Bought out the lease for their expensive NYC corporate main office. This was the vast majority of their lease obligations.

12/20 - Issued press release stating relaunch of strategic alternative search in order to “Fully maximize shareholder value”.

12/20 - Lender waived covenants  until Feb 22, 2021.

**This is not a fire sale**

Management has successfully cut expenses and the company is now cash flow positive. The expense reduction initiatives have been successful and we are near the previous 30M run rate goal. The vast majority of lease obligations have been eliminated.

Reported shareholders equity is 27M. This follows the 2020 impairment charge taken during the early phase of Covid-19 store closures. Note, there is no mechanism to increase this equity in case value returns or increases. This therefore represents what management thought the brands were worth at the time of impaired sales and earnings. Shareholders equity is coincidentally equal to today’s market cap. Additionally, the company has 300M in NOL’s and shouldn’t pay taxes for sometime. 

**A quick look at the valuation**

Mkt Cap 27M

Cash 13M

Debt \~ 450M 

EV \~ 464M

q3 EBIT 16.4M; annualized = **65M** (q4 likely stronger)

EV/EBIT = 7.1x

The home business (Martha Stewart Living and Emeril Legassi) sold for EBIT multiple of 8x (excluding a 40M earn out). 

8x multiple  =  **70M equity value** 

*(8x 65) -450 =70*

Competitor(s).

This is an out of favor industry. Major competitors include APEX (delisted, solvency questions) and Iconix. Iconix is most similar. After a recent run-up in share price, Iconix trades at EV/EBIT = 10.5x. 

10.5x multiple = **232.5M mkt cap** 

**Connecting the dots**

Sequential Brands is now a company with no CEO, no CFO, and no corporate HQ.  Expenses have been aggressively cut. What we are left with is a nice lean package ready for sale. Their lender is providing extensions and therefore presumably believes a sale is at least possible. Furthermore, they likely do not want to be handed the keys to this brand management company. Management (Chairman owns 13%) is highly incentivized to get a deal done before 4/2021, as after that date the lender takes the board seats.

**Discussion**

During the worst in-person retail environment of last year, the company took an impairment charge related to brand valuation. Net debt, this corresponds to today's market cap. We can use this value (27M) as a bottom valuation, as sales have since recovered. In 2019, Sequential sold its home division at an 8x EBIT multiple. If we apply this multiple, we see a market cap of 56M. We should note that the current brand composition achieves a higher margin (>65%) than the home division(\~50%). If we use the most similar competitor’s multiple (ICON), we see a much higher valuation. To summarize, it's not clear what a sale will produce. However, we have a very motivated management team on a short timeline and a company tee’d up for a sale. If a sale happens, we have downside protection with upside optionality depending on the sale multiple. 

RISK: If a sale fails to materialize, the company will be in the hands of a creditor and valuation will likely suffer greatly.

**Business Description**

CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership that makes and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. They are the only pure play publicly listed North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. They operate two facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas, and East Dubuque, Illinois. CVR Partners’ primary product is UAN, a value-added nitrogen-based fertilizer. The proximity of the manufacturing facilities to end markets gives them a $15-$25/t freight advantage vs. imports ([UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html)).

**Opportunity**

Production of UAN is a high fixed cost business. The operating leverage allows for outsized profits in a favorable commodity market. The price of nitrogen fertilizers tends to slightly lag crop prices - primarily corn and beans. When the price of corn is high, the incremental yield from fertilizing generates more revenue than the cost of the fertilizer. This incentivizes farmers to use more fertilizer. In December 2020, the price of corn rose to a 7-year high and is ~$5.50 per bushel. [Corn futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html) are forecast to stay above $5.00 per bushel through the summer. [Q1 UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola-swaps.html) prices followed in January 2021 rising from $150/t to ~$240/t. CVR Partners’ breakeven UAN gate price (the point at which there are zero annual distributions to unitholders) is $169/t UAN. Note that this implies a UAN NOLA (Futures Price) of $144-154/t when you factor in their freight advantage. This analysis does not include an in-depth forecast of commodity markets. For simplicity, I’ve assumed current commodity future prices remain constant. Use the sensitivity table at the end for returns at your own assumed UAN price. 

**Forecast**

Q4/20 will be terrible. Using the [UAN River Points spread](https://my.stonex.com/s/subcategory?language=en_US&commodityId=9056), CVR Partners gate price was about $150/t UAN. This isn't enough for a distribution. I estimate that there will be a cash burn of $10-$15MM for the quarter. Not good, but Q4/20 is in the rearview mirror now. What makes CVR Partners compelling is when we look at how the market has evolved for 2021. My 2021 forecast assumes pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html). The average UAN NOLA is $213/t for H1 and $171/t for H2. Assuming this pricing for end products, UAN will generate $5.37 per unit in distributions in H1. Were it not for the scheduled turnaround (plant maintenance) at Coffeyville in Q3, there would be another $1.87 in H2. However, a conservative 28-day turnaround leaves us with an additional $0.42 distribution in H2. If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, current commodity prices support 2021 distributions of $5.79 per unit after all maintenance, turnarounds, and service of the current debt is accounted for.

**9.25% Callable Notes**

CVR Partners has $645M principle 9.25% coupon senior secured notes due in 2023. The notes were issued to fund the acquisition of the East Dubuque plant. These notes are callable in June 2021 without a penalty. The current market yield for single B issuers is ~5%. If CVR Partners are able to refinance the 9.25% senior secured notes with a high yield issue at 5%, this will save them $27M per year in interest and generate an additional $2.47 in distributions per unit. On previous conference calls, management have indicated their intention to refinance these notes in June 2021. With a simple dividend discount model and a 10% cost of equity capital, the incremental CAFD from refinancing the debt is worth more than the current share price. I believe this forms a value floor for the current units and mitigates the inherent commodity price risk.

**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea, Ammonia) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer in the spring will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

**Conclusion**

In the 3 years prior to the pandemic, CVR Partners traded in a range of $25 - $42 per unit with UAN prices sub-$200. On the back of rising crop prices, 2021 fertilizer forecasts are looking strong going into the spring planting season. CVR Partners offers pure play exposure to North American nitrogen fertilizer and is positioned well to benefit from current prices. Refinancing the senior secured notes provides significant additional unit value that can be crystalized independent of future commodity prices. At the current unit price, the risk vs. reward is very favorable.

**This Howard Marks quote below about ""sticking to your discipline"" inspired me to dig into the data a bit to see how much truth there is to it.** My comments below. Interested in any feedback!

""There are a lot of ways to make money. Growth investors, value investors, momentum investors, traders. You and I think fundamental investing and buying things for less than they're worth is the most dependable of those... Techniques go in and out of style. And sometimes if they work too well for too long then they stop working merely because they worked too well for too long; their end is self-created. Barton Biggs published a book in the first decade of this century called Hedge Hogging. And he had a section where he talked about the most famous investors, and how much time they spent in the dog house. We all have to accept that no approach works all the time. And certainly no approach is the best all the time. It rotates. And we should come to a conclusion about which way is the best and we should hold to it strongly - and accept the fact that it will be out of style from time to time. Accepting a philosophy and sticking to it is much better than having no philosophy and dabbling with each one when you guess it's going to work. I always say if you stand at a bus stop long enough you'll get a bus. But if you run from bus stop to bus stop you may never get a bus. And I think that's an important thing for people to accept, nothing will work all the time.""

Of course there's truth to this and intuitively it makes sense. This got me curious though. **What does the data look like for some kind of measured trend-following strategy?** Say, for example, we compared these four approaches.

A. An S&P index fund 1994-2021

B. A US value index fund that whole time

C. A US growth index fund that whole time

D. An approach that shifts to value or growth, based on what outperformed in the previous year.

I'm curious enough to investigate this question so I'll follow up with results. I'm going to guess that C did best, followed by D, followed by A, followed by B, though I'm keen to see what the data says.

Grains of salt:

1. Keep in mind that trend-following benefited from extended periods of outperformance by one style or the other during this period (growth outperformed 1994-1999, 2009-2012, & 2017-2020; value outperformed 2000-2006). Who's to say there won't be more alternation year-to-year in the future?
2. What Marks considers ""sticking to a discipline"" is not the same thing as sticking to a factor, though I think factors are an ok proxy for a thought experiment. The crux of his point is that investors are better off sticking with a good discipline then following every trend they hear about, which is surely true.

These caveats aside, here's what I found.

**UPDATE #1:**

Wow! Interesting results. Here's how these 4 portfolios compare, dating back to January 1994 (when some of these Vanguard funds first came out).

Compound Annual Growth Rate = ((final $/beginning $) \^ (1/# of years)) - 1

1994-2021:

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 11.2%
2. **Trend-Following Portfolio (either value or growth) 10.91%**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 9.98%
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 8.94%

FYI, I created the ""trend-following"" portfolio using the dynamic allocation tool from the website portfolio visualizer. For each year, the ""trend-following"" portfolio is either set to growth (VIGRX) or value (VIVAX) - based on whichever factor performed better the year prior. The trend-following portfolio is: 1994 Value, 1995-2000 Growth, 2001-2007 Value, 2008 Growth, 2009 Value, 2010-2013 Growth, 2014 Value, 2015-2016 Growth, 2017 Value, 2018-2021 Growth.

Here's a chart of the trend-following portfolio (""Dynamic Allocation"") vs the S&P 500 (""Static Allocation"") from 1994 thru today. https://pasteboard \[dot\] co/JOfTYbr.png

**What's the takeaway here?**

**The point of this backtest is not to advocate any particular trend-following approach (though it actually doesn't look like a bad strategy!). It's to challenge the notion that investors need to stay rigidly consistent in a discipline to outperform.** If they have reason to evolve their approach with the times, perhaps they should.

All the best investors investors have experienced periods of underperformance. For those who want to give themselves a chance to perform among the best quartile/quintile of investors, sticking with a single style may be your best bet! There's a reason the growth portfolio outperformed the trend-following portfolio a bit; missing out on a rotation by definition ensures you won't have the best returns possible. Just keep in mind, (at least from a factor perspective) if you stuck to your principles and guessed wrong during this period, you would've ranked last. **If your goal is to give yourself the best chance possible to outperform the market, catching the bus a year late might not be such a bad approach**.

At the very least, this suggests that it's probably not a good idea to do the opposite! Meaning, frequently shift away from the style that's in favor assuming a near-term reversion.

**UPDATE #2**

To stress test this trend-following idea a bit, I've re-run the backtest in a couple ways.

**1st challenge: Begin the backtest in the worst possible year (2000)**

First, let's start the backtest in the worst possible starting year. Let's set the first year to 2000, with the trend portfolio starting out fully in growth just in time to get slammed by the tech bubble. This made it a lot closer, but the rank order of the portfolios actually stayed the same.

2000-2021:

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 6.85% CAGR
2. **Trend-Following Portfolio (either value or growth) 6.66%**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 6.42%
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 6.35%

The trend following portfolio remains above-index.

Here's a chart for this timeframe. https://pasteboard \[dot\] co/JOffvDJ.png

**2nd challenge: Assume a tech-bubble event in 2021**

To challenge this idea in another way, let's assume there's a tech-bubble level crash in 2021. This essentially represents the worst-case scenario for the trend-following portfolio, since it would be fully invested in growth in 2021.

In 2000, the S&P lost 9.06%, growth (VIGRX) lost 22.21%, and value actually **gained** 6.08%.

Let's say the same thing happens in 2021 and re-calculate CAGR.

If there's a tech bubble type year in 2021, here's how the 4 strategies compare from 1994 through the 2021 tech bubble.

1994 - 2021 (assuming a tech bubble level collapse this year):

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 10.45% (down from 11.2%)
2. **Value/Growth Annual Trend-Following 10.16% (down from 10.91%)**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 9.83% (down from 9.98%)
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 9.39% (up from 8.94%)

**Whether you assume catastrophe for the first or last year, a trend-following approach would have outperformed the market over the last few market cycles. If you want to shoot for the top spot on the leader-board, sticking it out on one side of the spectrum or the other might be the way to go, but it's also the way to bottom spot, too.**

As a value investor who's come around to holding major positions in GARP stocks like AMZN, MSFT, FB, & GOOGL in recent years, this is encouraging to me.

""We shall conclude with a practical observation that is based on experience rather than theory. When the general market is high  there are always a number of individual issues that appear definitely undervalued by objective standards and consequently even more attractive in contrast to the inflated level of other  stocks. The analyst may be tempted to recommend these as unusual opportunities. Not only may the “neglected security” continue neglected for the remainder of the bull market, but when the downturn comes it is likely to decline in price along with the general market and to fully as great an extent. In a word, beware of “bargains” when most stocks seem very high.""

* He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)
* As of early 2021 all 100 companies have posted a 100% return
   * (Share price at end of 2019 - Share price End of January 2021) / (Share price at end of 2019)

I thought that statement was bonkers, so I took a list of NYSE + NASDAQ companies \~ 6500, excluded SPACs/warrants and anything that through an error in google sheets (lazy I know), which left around 5000 equities.

* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a >100% return from their 52 week low
* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 500 have posted a >500% return from their 52 week low

So I try to rationalize these as buying opportunities as a result from COVID but when I filter the 5,000 equities to only include companies w/ a TTM EPS of <0 **I am left with 2500.**

So 2500, or \~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS <0).

What blows my mind is of these 2,500 ""unprofitable companies"" :

1,795 have had a >100% return from their 52 week low500 of the have had a >50% return YTD

WTF?

* 50% of all publicly traded NASDAQ/NYSE companies are not profitable
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Result = 2500
* Yet 35% have posted a 100% return from their 52 week low
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 + only list equities where ((current price - 52weeklow)/52weeklow) > 100% )
   * Result = 1795
* And 10% have had a **2021 YEAR TO DATE RETURN OF > 50%**
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 + only list equities where ( (currentprice - price on 1/1/21) / price on 1/1/21 ) > 50%)
   * Result = 500

I mean guys, do this yourself if you don't believe me - it's literally 5 GOOGLEFINANCE functions a bunch of pivot tables in excel.

What I dont have is a relative basis for comparison, e.g if these numbers are normal in a pre-covid environment, e.g. 5 years ago, 10 years ago, etc.

I mean I love a good rally, and i'm definitely in some risky small caps but when I see companies like SOUTHWEST AIRLINES posting negative quarter-over-quarter earnings, yet it is trading back at pre-pandemic levels I have come to one of two conclusions:

1. **My math is wrong and I am in a moron**
2. There will be a ""major correction"" in 2021

I would love to get feedback from the community at large, especially from the contrarians and old timers. Also, if one were to ""capitalize on a major correction in the next 12 months"" what would you recommend? Buy VIX?","self","https://redd.it/lk6c44"

The Company is the largest independent supplier of OLED DDICs which power the display screens, and focused on high frame rate phones. It’s tied to the hip of Samsung and LG and a big winner in the OLED space especially with 5G and will most likely beat their Q4 guidance. OLED and chip manufacturers are fully sold out as per guidance from several semiconductor companies.

For each phone with OLED, there is 1 DDIC. For a rollable or foldable OLED screen, there are more than 1 DDIC chip on average. The Company is also getting into laptop, TV, and auto OLED screens which all use more than 1 chip (given larger size).

**Q4 2020 Guidance Beat**

Q4 '20 revenue/profits are likely to surprise, here’s why: in their most recent analyst presentation, they said their Q4 guidance put out in Q3 was based on LOWER manufacturing capacity from their foundry partners. That allocation went up.

From the analyst call: ""Our Q4 revenue guidance range was based on allocation from foundry partners for OLED as well as internal Fab 3 ramp-up. We were able to secure greater supply than we originally expected.""

&#x200B;

[MX Guidance on Additional Foundry Allocation](https://preview.redd.it/flb34pst9uh61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ade06f843071dd22ec8fb9f8039c8573ae2c4f)

The supply crunch is affecting 8"" fabs and the Company focuses on using 12"" foundries which are less tight, and that explains why Magna Chip was able to receive more allocation.

In addition, there is likely strong forward guidance given improved margins below...

**Supply Crunch and Potential Acquirer?**

Synaptics, a $3.7bln market cap company that dominates the adjacent semiconductor touch chips for OLED screens (called TDDI, used in all AAPL phones) in their earnings call on Feb 4 said there is a supply crunch in OLED DDICs and a potential for ""a tactical opportunity"":

""Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed..\\\[On\\\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity.""

&#x200B;

Synaptics acquired an OLED DDIC company in the past (8-9 years ago) and did not make much out of it, focusing on the touch aspect versus the IC chip. However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for the Company.

HIMX, another company operating in the display panel space (albeit not in OLED), has said that the transition from LCD to OLED screens is happening fast and sees OLED DDIC s as a major opportunity: ""As we have repeatedly indicated, traditional smartphone DDICs are quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED....We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small- and medium-panel driver IC business in 2021.""

&#x200B;

[HIMX Earnings Call Feb 2021](https://preview.redd.it/zhyh84d0auh61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ff6863f36bca877e2c153b3143f20fc3bdf473)

In fact, HIMX said that given the ""helplessly tight"" semiconductor situation. **""We can very often transfer the cost increase to customers and a bit more.""**

**This is YJ Kim's (MX CEO) comments from Q3 earnings that supports many design wins with next generation 5G smartphones:**

5G momentum: We are enjoying the booming 5G smartphone industry especially with High Frame Rate (HFR) OLED DDIC. In Q3, we were awarded 8 new design wins, and 7 of them were 5G and HFR models using 28 nm process. You may recall that our revenue from 5G smartphones counted for about 20% of the total OLED revenue in 1H 2020. In Q3, 5G revenue represented about 40% of the OLED revenue. According to the market data, the global 5G smartphone shipment in 2020 will be about 200 million units, and it will likely to be more than double in 2021.

**Conclusion**

For a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -> drastically undervalued at \\\~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...

Recommendation: Shares are more attractive given the options are somewhat thinly traded.

**Some news articles** (from another [u/wallstreetbets1999](https://www.reddit.com/u/wallstreetbets1999/)

Magnachip has a good chance to get into the iPhone13, as Samsung is the sole supplier of OLED LPTO panels to the iPhone13 (noted below), and Magnachip has one of the best OLED DDIC drivers, the 28nm chip that supports HFR, 120hz and LPTO as noted below.

Some background on Magnachip Semiconductor as they are the leading independent supplier of OLED DDIC and they tapped out the industry leading chip, the 28nm OLED DDIC back in 2019 for the current transition of 5G smartphones that are adapting OLED panels, as noted in a recent press release.

Raj Gill from Needham noted back then this chip could make it into the next generation of iPhones.

May 1, 2018 – Magnachip upgraded by Needham and company citing

“Importantly, while still unknown, we believe MX is in a good competitive position to be a second source to Apple for the OLED DDIC next year as it is taping out a 28nm OLED DDIC with exceptional low-power."" Link below.

Listen to the Needham Growth Conference with Magnachip CEO

They recently participated in the 23rd annual needham growth conference on January 12th. A lot of this analysis is based on this call. Link below to the recorded call with Raj Gill from Needham and YJ the CEO of Magnachip. Start listening from 15:30 as Raj Gill asks questions.

Registration is easy….just put in your info no account is created, it takes you straight to the presentation from YJ Kim of Magnachip.

Listen to the whole thing of you like…Q&A starts at 15:30 which supports my thoughts on a Q4 beat and possibly an iPhone13 OLED DDIC driver design win later as noted below.

At 20:20 in the interview Magnachip’s CEO YJ Kim states and I am paraphrasing “Q4 guidance was based on numbers given from my foundry partners, Global Foundries and another foundry partner. We were able to get more supply from both of our foundry partners as a result of our C-level and my direct customer putting weight on the foundry partners”

At 21:35 Raj Gill and YJ Kim discuss that Magnachip is working with a 3rd foundry partner to expand capacity for OLED DDIC drivers. In my option this will raise the target numbers for fiscal year 2021 for their OLED DDIC business and I suspect this 3rd foundry partner is TSMC as noted by DigiTimes below.

TSMC in talks for new orders for OLED driver IC (subscription required to read the whole article)

Monica Chen, Hsinchu; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES

Wednesday 18 November 2020

TSMC is in talks with a Korean client for manufacturing OLED driver ICs using the foundry's 28nm high-voltage process, according to industry sources.

The new orders would further tighten TSMC's 28nm process capacity, which has seen strong demand despite its higher quotes than those offered by other foundry houses, the sources indicated.

At 35:40 in the conference Raj Gill from Needham references an article that Samsung will be the exclusive supplier for LPTO OLED panels to iPhone13. and he asks JY KIM – what does that mean for your business? YJ Kim responds and I am paraphrasing “We support LPTO display requirements with our display chip already. In addition we have a strong relationship with the top OLED panel makers” Raj Gill is most likely referring to this article in the Korean Press from 01/06/2021– TheElec.com - Samsung to be the exclusive supplier of LTPO OLED for next iPhone 13

Magnachip could very well have the 28NM - OLED DDIC chip design win with Samsung panels / LPTO with Magnachip's OLED DDIC.

This is YJ Kim Magnachip CEOs comments from Q3 earnings that supports many design wins with next generation 5G smartphones:

Paper from late January 2021 quantifying the impact of Robinhood traders on the market. Interesting to see some numbers on this. I've pasted the Abstract & Conclusion below; see the link above for the full paper. Comment with any thoughts.

## Abstract

Retail trading activity has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper quantifies the impact of the retail investment boom on the US stock market within a structural model. Using account holdings data from the online trading platform “Robinhood Markets Inc.” and 13F filings, we estimate retail and institutional demand curves and derive aggregate pricing implications via market clearing. The inelastic nature of institutional demand allows Robinhood investors to have a substantial effect on stock returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their negligible market share of 0.2%, we find that Robinhood traders account for over 7% of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns during the second quarter of 2020. We furthermore show that without the surge in retail trading activity the aggregate market capitalization of the smallest quintile of US stocks would have been over 30% lower. Lastly, Robinhood traders are able to affect the price of some large individual companies that are being held primarily by passive institutional investors.

## Conclusion

This paper investigates the effects of retail trading activity on the US equity market within a structural model. To quantify the respective impact of retail and institutional demand on the US equity market, we use the Demand System Approach to Asset Pricing introduced by Koijen and Yogo (2019). We find that the majority of all institutional investors - who hold over 60% of the market - have inelastic demand. Because they respond inelastically to price changes, the small retail sector can have substantial price effects. We show, that over 7% of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns during the pandemic can be attributed to the demand of Robinhood traders. They furthermore alleviated the stock market crash during the first quarter of 2020 by 2%. By buying the small cap stocks that institutions were fire-selling they provided considerable liquidity to the US stock market. Robinhood traders also boosted the recovery in Q2 by adding 1% to the aggregate stock market valuation. Given our approximation of their assets under management, this implies a multiplier effect of 5. The price impact of Robinhood traders is concentrated towards small cap stocks and the consumer staples industry. However, they are able to affect the price of some large companies, which are being held primarily by passive investors. Our analysis shed light on the intricate relationship between retail and institutional investors. The Demand System offers a feedback mechanism in which one agent’s demand shock reverberates on another’s demand function through market equity. We show that when institutions react sluggishly to non-fundamental price changes, the mechanism stifles and retail demand shocks can have substantial impacts on stock prices. Our findings have important implications for policy makers. Large scale policies, such as the 2020 CARES act, have the potential to move prices considerably far from their fundamental values, if households invest rather than consume their share. Moreover, the prominent role of Robinhood traders in driving returns evokes concerns about the future role of retail trading in equity markets. If - facilitated by novel fintech solutions - the retail sector continues to grow its wealth share, the extraordinary volatility observed during the pandemic may turn out to be the new normal.","self","https://redd.it/lm657c"

The current share price is at the high end of my most optimistic estimate of its fair value. By my estimate, the current price assumes very strong growth, compounding, for the next 5-10 years. I've seriously considered selling some of this position over the last week because it is by far my largest position, but I've held myself back because I like the company and plan to hold it for a long time.

At the same time this company has been continuously diluting their shares over the last 5 years and this has always been my biggest concern as I don't like to see my ownership diluted. However, at the current valuations I am now starting to realize that if the company starts to issue more shares, it will benefit me and I should continue to hold. They already have a shelf registration in place, so I imagine they are already selling more shares.

I've pretty much always operated under the assumption that any share dilution will be bad for owners, but now I'm realizing that isn't always the case and that extremely high valuations can be very beneficial to current owners and are not always a reason to sell. Some approximate numbers for this case:

 - Current market cap = $1,200
 - Estimated forward net income per year = $62

Let's assume over the next 10 years the net income remains the same. In this case, my total income over the next 10 years would be $620

Now let's see what happens if we dilute the shares by 10% (note, I'm going to assume no cost or effect on share price of the dilution)

 - Market cap after dilution = $1,320
 - Cash from issuance = $120
 - Estimated forward net income per year = $74

We are assuming that the money that we raised can return 10% per year so that our new 10 year income number is $740. We are diluted by 10%, so our share of profits are now $672.72, about 8% higher than if we hadn't sold more shares. Even if the extra cash isn't put to profitable use, but management wastes half of it then returns the other half back to shareholders at the end of 10 years, our share of the profits would still be $618 at the end, almost no worse off than if management hadn't issued more shares at all.

I think in this case there can still be an argument made to sell. As the dilution occurs and the market corrects back to a more realistic valuation I am expecting the price to fall. I could sell now and buy back in at a lower price, but I think psychologically I will do better if I just hold. I imagine that there could be a case where I sell out and the stock never drops again and I never buy in again.

**Business Description**

CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership that makes and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. They are the only pure play publicly listed North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. They operate two facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas, and East Dubuque, Illinois. CVR Partners’ primary product is UAN, a value-added nitrogen-based fertilizer. UAN is a seasonal product with the primary application taking place in the spring planting season. The proximity of the manufacturing facilities to end markets gives them a $15-$25/t freight advantage vs. imports ([UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html)).

**Opportunity**

Production of UAN is a high fixed cost business. The operating leverage allows for outsized profits in a favorable commodity market. The price of nitrogen fertilizers tends to slightly lag crop prices - primarily corn and beans. When the price of corn is high, the incremental yield from fertilizing generates more revenue than the cost of the fertilizer. This incentivizes farmers to use more fertilizer. In December 2020, the [price of corn](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/corn-price) rose to a 7-year high and is ~$5.50 per bushel. [Corn futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html) are forecast to stay above $5.00 per bushel through the summer. [Q1 UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola-swaps.html) prices followed in January 2021 rising from $150/t to ~$240/t. CVR Partners’ breakeven UAN gate price (the point at which there are zero annual distributions to unitholders) is $169/t UAN. Note that this implies a UAN NOLA (Futures Price) of $144-154/t when you factor in their freight advantage. This analysis does not include an in-depth forecast of commodity markets. For simplicity, it’s assumed current commodity future prices remain constant. Use the sensitivity table at the end for returns at your own assumed UAN price. 

**Forecast**

Q4/20 was terrible. CVR Partners gate price was about $139/t UAN. The partnership lost $10MM in OCF. Not good, but Q4/20 is in the rearview mirror now. What makes CVR Partners compelling is when we look at how the market has evolved for 2021. The 2021 forecast assumes pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html). The average UAN NOLA is $236/t for H1 and $187/t for H2. Assuming this pricing for end products, UAN will generate $109MM in EBITDA in H1. Were it not for the scheduled turnaround (plant maintenance) at Coffeyville in Q3, there would be another $60MM EBITDA in H2. However, a conservative 28-day turnaround leaves us with an additional $48MM EBITDA in H2. If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, current commodity prices support 2021 EBITDA of $157MM. Using a historical multiple of 8.0x EV / EBITDA implies a share price of ~$60.00 per share.

This valuation approach is more conservative than the CAFD I used previously. The valuation used previously (10x CAFD) implies a 9x EV/EBITDA multiple. I’ve moved away from the CAFD because I expect that there will be a lot of noise in the 2021 CAFD which skews the underlying performance. The noise will be driven by: 1 – buybacks have reduced CAFD ($10M in 2020 and another $10M expected in Q1/21). 2 – Reserves for debt refinance fees and potential reduction in principle outstanding. 3 – Transaction/structuring fees to monetize the tax credits. See below for more details on these. I’ve provided calculation summaries and sensitivities on each driver so that you can easily use your own assumptions and come up with your own view on value. 

**A Gift From The Government**

In January 2021, the US government approved [Section 45Q](https://www.projectfinance.law/publications/tax-credits-for-carbon-capture). Section 45Q provides tax credits for carbon capture. CVR Partners sequesters about 1 million metric tons of carbon per year. They indicated on their Q4/20 call and in the [2020 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425292/000142529221000007/cvi-20201231.htm) that they are exploring options to monetize these tax credits. The form of this structure is still unknown, but it seems they will try to time this with the refinancing of their debt in June 2021. If they can monetize these credits, the estimated value of the credits from 2021-25 (the period the current regs cover) is $103MM @ 10% discount rate. If they can claim credits for previous sequestration from 2018-2020, this is an additional $53MM. The total value of these on a per share basis is between $9 and $14 per share.

**9.25% Callable Notes**

CVR Partners has $645M principle 9.25% coupon senior secured notes due in 2023. The notes were issued to fund the acquisition of the East Dubuque plant. These notes are callable in June 2021 without a penalty. The current market yield for single B issuers is ~5%. If CVR Partners can refinance the 9.25% senior secured notes with a high yield issue at 5%, this will save them $27M per year in interest. On previous conference calls, management have indicated their intention to refinance these notes in June 2021. With a simple dividend discount model and a 10% cost of equity capital, the incremental value from refinancing the debt is worth the current share price. This forms a compelling value floor for the shares.

**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea, Ammonia) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer in the spring will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

**Conclusion**

In the 3 years prior to the pandemic, CVR Partners traded in a range of $25 - $42 per unit with UAN prices sub-$200t/t. On the back of rising crop prices, 2021 fertilizer forecasts are looking strong going into the spring planting season. CVR Partners offers pure play exposure to North American nitrogen fertilizer and is positioned well to benefit from current prices. Regardless of the commodity forecast, there are several uncorrelated catalysts that generate substantial value independent of fertilizer prices. They are summarized below:




Value Driver| Equity Value $USMM| $ per share
---|---|----
Operations Under Current Commodity Prices| $642| $61.16
Monetize 2021-25 Carbon Credits	|	 $103  	| $9.81  
Monetize 2018-20 Carbon Credits	|	 $53  	| $5.08  
NPV of Savings From Debt Refinance |	 $274  |	 $26.13  
Total Potential Equity Value	|	 $1,072  	| $102.17  


**Potential Strategies**

**Common Units**

An investment at the equity at the current share price could result in up to 4x return on investment using the base assumptions. If macro trends persist - these trends tend to be multi-year on capital intensive, cyclical industries - this has great short and mid (1-3 year) potential with limited downside if you believe that just the Debt Refinance is possible. 

**Options**

Management has indicated that they intend to refinance the debt as soon as the bonds are callable at par (June 2021). They also plan to monetize the carbon capture credits at the same time and potentially use the proceeds to reduce debt. This creates a unique situation where all 3 major catalysts will be known by the time Q2 results are released in the 1st or 2nd week of August 2021. Purchasing options with Aug 20, 2021 expiry is an efficient way to gain leverage on these defined catalysts. You can use the sensitivities provided and the Value Driver table to come up a value using your own assumptions. Even if only part of the value is realized here, there is potential for massive gains.

Not much to pull apart here, but I will, because I love a good TPG faceplant. So, the valuation which is, apparently more than DISH? All of dish. Including Sling and 5G assets. I’ve been thinking dish is undervalued, myself. But maybe I have more faith in Charlie’s 5G than everyone else.

So my first thought is that TPG is TPG-ing again. I can’t possibly imagine how they came up with that number. AT&T also gets 4.25 billion of Jr preferred units with a 6.5% PIK. Not a PIK toggle. TPG’s contribution is 1.8bil which has them levered less than 5:1 by my back of the napkin math. Is this a good business? Because that’s what you would commit to a good business, not a dying one. Am I missing something about linear TV?

I think this is good for AT&T in terms of spectrum auction financing and just... getting rid of the business unit, albeit slowly. They need cash for the 5G auctions.

Without splitting out revenue for DTV, but given that it’s losing subscribers like they’re fleeing the Titanic, I’m going to assume it’s not doing especially well. And it really shouldn’t be, because it’s a bad service, in my subjective opinion (as someone who has cancelled it). Maybe losing just a tiny bit of money?

I’m sure the new entity will report up. But I think this is a step in the right direction for T, and I’m glad they found a buyer. Nevertheless if TPG wants your assets, you can assume your assets are crap.

I’m sure there’s more analysis to come, but as someone who has been hoping for a debt reduction at AT&T, I’m happy. And as I said I love a good TPG faceplant.","self","https://redd.it/lswbbr"

Financials is a pretty safe/obvious pick.

Something less known is that energy stocks perform pretty similarly in rising and falling interest rate environments. Over the last 50 years, energy returned 12.1% when rates were falling and 10.1% when rates were rising. Over the same time, the S&P returned 15.2% when rates were falling and 5.8% when rates were rising.

Both sectors also still look pretty undervalued.

Today I'm going to be doing a DD into Charter Communications ($CHTR). They have seen a surprisingly large appreciation for such a large-cap company, so I figured I'd do a bit of digging.

**Business**

Charter is an internet service and cable provider operating throughout 43 states. They offer services to both commercial and residential customers through Spectrum on a subscription basis. Spectrum strives at driving synergy across products by selling bundles of mobile, internet, and cable services together. This strategy has paid off as over 56% of customers subscribe to any one of these bundles.

The average residential customer spends $111.15 per month and the average commercial customer spends $165.60 per month.

Spectrum's operations can be broken up into 3 segments: Internet Services (52%), Video Services (36%), and Other Services (12%). Let's take a closer look.

**Internet Services (52% of Revenue)**

This is a fast-growing segment that's seen massive tailwinds due to COVID-19. They saw 11% growth YoY. Most of that growth occurred because of a savvy promotion they did for students. While there is a lot of competition against established giants like VZ and T, I still think they can eke out growth in their commercial and small business internet offerings.

**Video Services (36% of Revenue)**

Yikes.

It's no secret cable is a dying medium. Fubo, Hulu, Prime Video, and many others take customers from this segment and promise to continue to do so. Spectrum Cable lost 484,000 customers in 2019 and managed to maintain steady revenue from this segment through price increases which will quicken the pace of customer outflow further. If Spectrum doesn't diversify or spin this segment off, it could be nasty.

**Other (12% of Revenue)**

This segment includes the newly established mobile internet service product (88% revenue growth YoY), voice services (-6% revenue growth YoY), and advertising sales (8% revenue growth YoY). This segment could see significant growth if Spectrum plays it right. As everyone knows, competition in the mobile service industry is fierce. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile Sprint are all players that promise to force operating margins down and competition up. The same goes for advertising services as well.

I think the thing you should take away from this segment is if Spectrum plays their hand right they can have a big success on their hands, and if they don't, this segment's going to be a huge flop.

With all the segments covered, let's move on to the fundamentals.

**Revenues**

[TTM Revenue Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/x6ldqlt7zik61.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=71050440ad6d4fdaa43f8238617ee30713662a88)

Charter has enjoyed positive revenue growth recently. YoY they've grown revenue 4.90%, over the last 3 years they've grown revenue by 15.44%, and have enjoyed revenue growth of 392.31%. In 2016, CHTR closed on their acquisition of Time Warner Cable, so the 5-year number is misleading.

Switching over the COGS (cost of goods sold), it's slightly lagged behind revenue which is good. COGS grew 4.39% YoY, 14.15% in the last 3 years, and 759.23% over the last 5 years. Again, this COGS increase is affected by the TWC acquisition.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we're shown a pretty inconsistent mess.

[Net Income Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/o9etf8dnzik61.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3932fbd7565bdae4a8a62887653bde58ac42d3)

We see a lot of spikes and downturns throughout the first 3 years followed by a consistent and large increase in the last 2 years. To quantify that, we've seen 92.14% Net Income growth YoY, 161.78% growth over the last 2 years, and -67.47% Net Income growth in the last 3 years.

**Margins**

CHTR currently has a 6.70% current Net Margin. This compares well with the 3.64% margin seen a year ago and poorly with the 23.80% margin seen 3 years ago.

**Assets/Debt**

CHTR has total assets of 144.19B, cash on hand of 1.28B, long-term debt of 77.95B, and total liabilities of 110.48B. Subtracting long-term debt from total liabilities, we see that CHTR's COH cannot cover its short-term liabilities.

[Assets Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/12e1yk8ezik61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=235fd5de56af7dfd6118a6a79af121c6362bbbe8)

[Liabilities Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/6hkxzm2hzik61.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=3793358a2e9a96d449c2597f3a80d011618c0c7c)

Looking at trends, we see that both liabilities and assets rocketed following their acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Following that initial spike, assets have slowly decreased and liabilities have slowly increased.

**Dividends**

CHTR doesn't currently pay a dividend, however, I can see it paying one in the near future for a couple of reasons. First of all, they have the Free Cash Flow to support one. In Q4 2020, CHTR brought in 1.65B in Free Cash Flow. Comparing this to Comcast which pays a 1.76% dividend and only brought in 1.52B in Free Cash Flow, I think it's not outlandish to say CHTR could easily afford to pay a 1-2% dividend.

The other reason is that they're in a defensive sector with poor growth prospects going forward. Cable is declining and the other sectors they're in are low-margin and high-competition. The only way they're going to be able to attract shareholders in these market conditions is to pay a handsome dividend.

**Price Ratios/Other**

CHTR has a current PE of 40x, which is higher than the average telecom sector PE of 29.65x. In the same vein, CHTR has a PEG of 2.1x which is decent considering the abundance of frothy valuations in today's market. CHTR has a current ROE of 9.40% implying that they're moderately efficient at generating income.

To further put that ROE number in perspective, Comcast has an ROE of 14.40%, AT&T has an ROE of 9.06%, and Dish has an ROE of 14.02%.

**DCF**

I calculated 2 scenarios. The first was assuming they continue the current year's revenue growth and grow 4.9% annually. I used a 7.5% Discount Rate for this scenario and, under those conditions, I got a fair value of $682.38 representing a >10% upside.

In the second scenario, I used far more conservative, and, in my opinion, more realistic inputs. I assumed a 2.5% revenue growth rate and a 7.5% Discount Rate. Using these new inputs, I got a fair value of $556.87 representing a downside of -10.1%

**PE Valuation**

Using a PE Value of 49.95x (the average PE over the last year), I get a fair value of $771.23 which implies a potential upside of 24.63%.

**Valuation Takeaways**

Averaging my conservative DCF price target with my more optimistic PE valuation, I get a probable fair value of $664.05 which implies a potential upside of 7.30%.

**Risks**

For any business of any size, there are risks. Here are some of the biggest ones for Charter:

1. Competition - The industries Charter operates in are highly competitive. Some of the largest and most established companies in the US (such as AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast) operate in direct competition with Charter. This has and will continue to draw down margins.
2. The Decline of Cable - Charter is very exposed to Cable which is losing customers at record paces. Anyone that still wants to retain cable services with one company or another has ruled out Charter because of their price hikes aimed at short-term revenue preservation.
3. Inability to Respond to Innovation - Being as large and as archaic as Charter means that any product changes they make occur at a very slow pace. This leaves them susceptible to any innovation that may occur in one of their operating segments.
4. Large Debt - Charter has a large amount of debt that they have to pay interest rates on. This amount of debt restricts Charter's ability to deploy large amounts of capital and makes potential creditors weary of lending them more money.
5. Warren Buffett - This is probably the least important risk, but it could have a large impact on the stock price. Charter is one of the most expensive stocks Warren Buffett owns and that makes it likely he'll begin trimming his stake at some point in 2021.

**Conclusion**

Despite its size, Charter is far from a safe play. Its large debt and exposure to cable are unappealing. Couple that with no current dividend, slow rates of growth, high competition, and a low margin of safety and you get a stock to stay away from.","self","https://redd.it/lvrk7c"

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger both preach the approach of buying wonderful businesses at a price that makes sense relative to the discounted cash they will produce and I agree with that, but Buffett's best returns in his career were when he followed the approach of Benjamin Graham of buying stocks under net current asset value(NCAV) or net-net working capital(NNWC). It seems Buffett only changed his approach after realizing that it was not possible to make high returns on that method with big money. Also many other investors seem to employ a style in-between the two methods of buying businesses that are going through a rough time and in the words of Dr Michael Burry ""seem like roadkill"" and then sell them when they return to normal methods.

Well my question is: what method do you think Buffett would use? What would you use? Which one will reduce the probability of principal loss the most? Which one will produce the highest returns repeating it for the long run? Would love your thoughts.","self","https://redd.it/lxhsg3"

Quite interesting (some charts in the link)

// **What Could Possibly Go Wrong? (Real Estate Edition)**

The excitement over rising yields and reflation has brought an analytical backlash. Both Albert Edwards, the famously bond-bullish and stock-bearish investment strategist at Societe Generale SA, and Joshi of BCA Research produced notes suggesting that the low for bond yields isn't yet in. In other words the deflationary slump has yet to run its course, and the rise in yields will itself provoke a final downswing. Edwards warns that “by going all in on that bet now, investors have likely gone too big, too soon, and are very exposed to a downside shock.” He agrees that we end with inflation, thanks to the Fed’s desperation to kindle it, but not yet.

Meanwhile Joshi makes an important argument that I have heard little about. In short, he reminds us that global real estate, all bar about 10% of which is residential, is worth far more than the world’s entire supply of stocks and bonds. At some $290 trillion, it’s even worth far more than the world’s annual gross domestic product:

This is important because housing has boomed on the back of low yields just as much as stocks — in fact, probably more. As Joshi shows, real estate prices have vastly outperformed rents, which have risen roughly in line with nominal GDP. Just as stocks’ P/E multiples have been buoyed by low yields, so house prices have been supported by startlingly cheap mortgage finance: 

 The implication is that we are all leveraged to low bond yields. As Joshi’s chart below shows, the implied rental yield paid by property has moved in line with yields on long U.S. and Chinese bonds. An increase in bond yields that in turn causes a drop of 10% in the level of global house prices isn’t hard to imagine. That would be a wealth effect of almost $30 trillion, or about a third of global GDP, and a sledgehammer to the world economy: 

Thus, Joshi argues that such a decline would inflict one last deflationary downdraft. That by extension means not betting all out on inflation just yet. He suggests the crucial stress point would come when 30-year yields reach 3.75%: 

>*where is the pain point? Our answer is that if inflation fears lifted the average US and China 30-year bond yield to 3.75 percent (from 3 percent now), it would constitute the change in trend that would unleash a massive countervailing deflationary impulse from falling house prices*

If any of this seems counterintuitive, look at the bizarre state of affairs where an entire generation seems to be unable to afford to buy a house, and adults are continuing to live in the parental home for many years after leaving school. That’s a clear indicator that housing is artificially expensive. Bringing prices down would be a great way to alleviate some of the ugliness and division in society — but it’s hard to see how that can happen without an accident. //

Would love to read the mentioned research done by Albert Edwards and Joshi.","self","https://redd.it/m07z4b"

**Comment below if you happen to know of any particularly brilliant small hedge funds.**

Bonus points for small hedge funds that meet any of these criteria:

* they focus on small & micro-cap stocks
* they're less than 5 years old
* or they have under $100 million AUM (below 13F requirements) but still disclose holdings on their website/in shareholder letters anyway.

As a side note, I'm perfectly able to sort hedge funds based on size & past performance, so I'm more interested in tips on small hedge funds that may not show up towards the top of lists for 1-year, 3-year, or 5-year past performance.

**On Small Hedge Funds vs Large Hedge Funds:**

I've recently familiarized myself with the research on size vs performance in hedge funds. It's not an easy subject to study since selection bias and survivorship bias are hard to week out, but based on available studies it seems like small hedge funds have historically had a statistically significant edge on a style-adjusted & risk-adjusted basis. If you're interested in this subject, I'd encourage you to look into it independently.

**Intuitively, it makes sense that hedge funds would exhibit diseconomies of scale since 1) large funds are less flexible to hunt for ideas among less-liquid small & micro-cap names, and 2) performance incentives decline which tends to decrease strategy distinctiveness (active share).**

Interestingly, **hedge fund \*age\* may also be negatively correlated with performance**. Here's one of the better recent papers on that question. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3169312](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3169312) If you take a look at [Table XI](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack/status/1372424915614326786) from the paper, you'll see **young AND small hedge funds perform best of all** in their sample. If you look at [Figure 1](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack/status/1372427669216854017), you'll see **they're also the most consistent year-to-year**. Their sample includes all available hedge funds, including defunct funds to mitigate survivorship bias, from 1994-2016. 

To quote Warren Buffett:

>""If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. **It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.** I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.” (Businessweek, 1999)

Ok, but why does this matter?

Because in 13F disclosure season there's plenty of attention on big name superinvestors, but a lot less so on smaller, newer hedge funds. To the extent that small hedge funds have a structural advantage, a smart approach may be to collect consensus holdings of leading small hedge funds - especially for small-cap investors.

**In any case, my reasons for selecting small funds for my sample aren't contingent on the diseconomies of scale thesis. I choose small hedge funds for my sample because small funds are more able to invest in less liquid small cap stocks. The goal of this research project is to create a list of small cap stocks to inform how to prioritize fundamental research.**

I focus on the smallest quintile of stocks because that's where there's the most inefficiency and opportunity for extreme outperformance if you're right. If small funds have a tail wind due to their wider opportunity set and stronger performance incentives, that's just a bonus.

**If you'd like to follow along or see a list of top small/micro cap stocks held by small hedge funds, the best way is to sign up for the email list in the pinned post here.** [https://twitter.com/WWSubstack](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack)

I share a weekly email that tracks any new analysis on top micro cap stocks held by hedge funds from quality sources on MicroCapClub, FinTwit, Morningstar, hedge fund letters, etc. I put a lot of work into that but it's free. Crossing fingers that enough members sign up for my paid monthly/quarterly research to make it worth my time.

Outside of great small hedge funds, if you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to share below. Thanks for the ideas.","self","https://redd.it/m7t654"

To be fair, it's not in their SEC filings, but quarterly earnings, presentations, etc. will discuss it. I believe their DCF measure has its roots in previously-popular MLP structures, which aren't nearly as in favor today. (separate discussion)

There are a handful of adjustments I see managements make to this figure from a more normal (GAAP) based income measure. The largest is to only deduct sustaining capital expenditures and not the full depreciation charge. 

**My question for the group is, is this economically reasonable?**

I'm conflicted, but my views are:

- Once a pipeline has been put in the ground, sure, it could be a while before you do large replacements. This means you depreciate the asset over a long period, usually decades and 50+ years seems possible.

- This large period of depreciation does produce cash flow that will be greater than GAAP earnings would imply.

- Eventually though, you have to replace the pipe. You may do it for various reasons such as a pipeline reversal, to transfer different products, expansion of the infrastructure, and so on.

It seems a little disingenuous to me for companies to present it this way, but the incentive is there - they want investors seeking yield and a higher share price.

As a newcomer, I could be wrong on this so it would be great if others can guide me on how to think about this more fully.","self","https://redd.it/m87ttr"

But I was discussing it in another thread, and did a sample scenario. Here's what I found:

********************************

Consider two companies, A and B. Both companies are exactly identical (market cap, net income, shares outstanding, etc), but company A opts to issue dividends while company B prefers to buy back shares. They both do so with all the earnings they make. 

Let's put some numbers to it: 

Year 0 (these apply to both companies)

Market cap: $20 billion

Earnings: $1 billion

Number of shares: 1 billion shares

Price per share = $20 (mkt cap/share count)

Earnings per share = $1 (earnings/share count)

PE = 20

At the end of year 1, company A issues a 5% dividend ($1 billion total distributed = total earnings) while company b buys back 5% of the shares (again, totaling $1 billion). Market cap and earnings remain constant.

Company A: 

Nothing changes. 5% return to the shareholder. PE still equals 20.

Company B:

Market cap: $20 billion (same)

Earnings: $1 billion (same)

Number of shares: 950 million shares (5% reduction)

Price per share = $21.05 (mkt cap/share count)

Earnings per share = 1.053 (earnings/share count)

PE = $21.05 / $1.053 = 20

Return to shareholder of company B = $21.05 / $20 = 5.25%

────────

I'm not sure why the price per share return on the buy back exceeds that of the dividend. I'd think it'd be the same. Maybe there's something to do with owning a larger stake in the company, but you could buy more shares in the dividend scenario, and only walk away with 5% more share in the company. 


What an I missing here?


************************

Edit: From u/ghale

>I believe the answer is that in the buyback situation you are forgetting the shareholders who sell back to the company. They get nothing except the price per share! Thus the same amount of rewards are distributed over the remaining shareholders. In the dividend case there are no shareholders who sell back, so the reward per share appears lower. The total reward paid to shareholders remains the same however.

I think this answers it.","self","https://redd.it/mdaif9"

I sketched out my understanding of the balance sheet movements below, and would appreciate someone familiar with the accounting critiquing it:

Let's say they sell you a phone for $400 which you pay for in installments. There's also an early trade in option, for which the carrier has to hold back a portion of the $400 as a guarantee obligation. It recognizes the rest as revenue (assume it's all profit).

A: $400 receivable...

L: $100 guarantee obligation...

E: $300 retained earnings

If you exercise the early trade in option right away, the carrier loses the receivable but gets your phone which they presumably sell for cash. How then does the guarantee obligation get extinguished? Does a gain on sale of $100 flow through the income statement and into retained earnings, like so:

A: $400 cash from sale of returned phone...

E: $400 retained earnings?

Separately, if you securitized the original receivable, the purchaser would take the gross receivable of $400, deduct the $100 early trade in guarantee obligation, leaving $300 in net receivables. The purchaser would advance $200 in cash and hold the remaining $100 for overcollateralization, recorded as deferred purchase price receivable. In this case, what asset sits across the $100 guarantee obligation?

A: $200 cash...

A: $100 deferred purchase price receivable...

A: $100 of some receivable not securitized, held against the guarantee? Or does this disappear from the asset side and extinguish the guarantee obligation? Or flow through as a loss on sale and reduce retained earnings?...

L: $100 guarantee obligation...

E: $300 retained earnings...

I don't know how much effort it will be to explain everything, so if I'm really off base, any resources you can direct me to would also be helpful. Thank you.","self","https://redd.it/mdq83b"

I own MoneySupermarket shares, purchased on 26th March 2021. The below write-up constitutes the research I undertook before deciding to make that purchase. These are my own reflections on the company as an investment prospect and are definitely not investment advice.


###Summary

I believe MoneySupermarket (MSM) is a stalwart in an industry with clear competitive advantages (evidenced by high returns on invested capital), selling at a discount to intrinsic value (roughly 20% below my valuation), with potential further upside, low downside risk, and a relative discount to both similar companies and the market as a whole.


###Business Overview

MSM is primarily a price comparison website allowing users to compare prices of insurance and credit cards. In addition to this, they run a website called Travel Supermarket which compares holiday packages and MoneySavingExpert which is one the UK's most popular sites and provides impartial financial advice.


The business model for all three sites is that MSM sends potential users to a third-party site to buy insurance, holidays, energy tariffs etc. and those companies pay MSM a commission for the referral.


The company also recently acquired a start-up called Decision Tech. They are a SaaS company offering the tech for price comparison platforms to other websites. (E.g. I have a blog and want to include a price comparison page for energy bills, I could use Decision Tech to implement that.)


The main moneysupermarket.com website accounts for the vast majority of the revenue, accounting for 88% in 2019. Breaking the total revenue down, insurance accounts for 49%, money (e.g. credit cards) 22% and home insurance 18%. Other, which includes travel and MSE accounts for 12%.


The industry has high fixed costs- marketing accounted for 59% of costs in 2020, with a further 21% of costs in staffing which are made up of tech, product operations and administration. Given the large investments in marketing and tech, economies of scale are clearly an important factor in the industry.


###Competitor Situation

The largest competitor in the UK price comparison game is comparethemarket.com (CTM), who are definitely the largest player by market share. In the 12 months ending June 2019 they earned £433M in revenue compared to an estimate (using average rev for 2019 & 2018) of £332M for MSM’s main site, putting MSM 23% behind.


The next largest competitor is gocompare.com, owned by Goco Group until recently being sold for £594M to Future plc. GoCo earned £12.7M from £152M of revenue in 2019, putting MSM’s main site 155% ahead.


This is followed by confused.com (owned by Admiral) who reported £112.7M of revenue in 2019, putting MSM 195% ahead.


Whilst CTM compete on the same entire offering as MSM, confused.com mostly compete just on car insurance.


There are other competitors such as uSwitch (2019 revenue of £134M) who compete more on energy and broadband deals.


###Growth

Over the five years prior to 2020, the group’s CAGR of revenue was 9.4% and earnings CAGR of 13%. Their profit margin has grown slowly but surely over the years, from 22.5% in 2015 to 25% in 2019.


When broken down by segment, the growth is somewhat more volatile due to peaks and troughs in availability of deals, regulation and various other factors (2019 5 year CAGR): Insurance: 6.4%, Money: 7.9%, Home: 25.1%, Other: 9.6%.


The company believes that the core market (car, home, and travel insurance) still has a lot of headroom for growth by increasing the frequency with which existing users switch and the penetration of people using price comparison sites. They forecast this growth at 4-5% annually (once back to normal trading levels after COVID).


In addition, they believe sufficient growth opportunities exist outside of this core market through their B2B offering and in digitising mortgages. The CEO has also stated that he sees a number of opportunities to improve existing customer retention through better CRM, auto-switching, and improving personalised recommendations for switching on other products.


Due to fixed costs, earnings have historically grown at a quicker rate than earnings as shown by the 5 year CAGR comparisons and the profit margin expansion that has occurred over the last decade.


###Risks

I believe MSM to be a relatively low risk investment: they have no debt, they have a long operating history and track record of consistently growing revenue and earnings with the only exception in the last 10 years being last year due to COVID. There are however some risks:
- Recession: although car insurance is a legal requirement, travel insurance and credit cards are not. When the total availability of credit decreases and personal finances are tighter, there will be less demand for travel insurance and less availability of credit card deals. | There’s not much that can be done about this risk, but I believe that due to the high profit margins of the business and lack of debt, there is little risk of the business going under during a recession (as evidenced by the still respectable level of profitability through 2020).

- Market share loss: If they don’t grow or keep their brand awareness, MSM could lose market share to its competitors. | This is the risk I am most concerned with. Comparethemarket.com and Go Compare both have had more consistent branding with well recognised mascots (Aleksandr the meerkat and Wynne Evans aka The GoCompare Man). MoneySupermarket on the other hand have had a number of catchphrases and advert themes over the years and no easy to recall frontman like its competitors. As addressed above, marketing is the biggest expense in this industry, so if they are not as effective at generating incremental customers with their marketing as their competitors, they will lose out. The newly placed CEO acknowledged in the most recent earnings presentation that their brand needs to be able to ‘hold its own’ against well-established peers and that they are in the process of reviewing whether their current creative is able to do that, so he is at least aware of the problem and taking action. In addition, the business is working to improve customer retention through better CRM campaigns (e.g. emailing users when their tariffs are up for renewal), which should also improve their effectiveness at driving traffic to the site.

- Regulation: Regulation on prices in any of the insurance markets or energy could negate the need for price comparison sites. | This has always been a risk but has so far not transpired. As mentioned above, MSM has consistently grown revenue and earnings over the course of the last decade. In fact, they have pointed out where regulation has changed previously, it brings bills top of mind and acts as a reminder for users to compare prices. It’s hard to quantify this risk, but I find it unlikely to be a substantial issue given that it’s not hampered performance yet and due to the fact that MSM offers a range of price comparisons, not just one.

- Insurers pull out: Insurance companies could decide to stop sharing their offering on price comparison sites. | As with the point above on regulation- price comparison sites now have a long operating history in the UK and so far this has not been a problem. The insurance companies clearly view price comparison sites as either a profitable acquisition channel for their products or at the very least a necessary evil to prevent themselves losing market share against competitors, which could be a very real outcome given the high proportion of people who report using price comparison sites when considering switching insurance providers. I see no reason why this will suddenly change, unless it comes in the form of regulation leading to no differentiation in price and therefore no need for price comparison sites.

###Valuation

Ignoring this year's earnings, which were impacted by COVID (although still leaving the company with £69M in earnings), and instead focusing on 2019’s earnings of £97M, the PE ratio at the current market cap of £1.44 billion is 15.


A quick benchmark against Go Compare’s sale to Future plc for £594M on 2019’s earnings put that PE at 47, 3.2X higher than MSM. However, it’s worth noting that on a price to revenue basis for 2019, the companies are much closer to even with MSM at 3.7 and Go Compare at 3.9. That being said, given the fixed costs mentioned multiple times above, I believe the PE comparison to be more meaningful (Future plc may believe they can make some synergy savings, but I don’t believe they can meaningfully achieve the same profit margin as MSM without substantial revenue growth).


To contextualise a PE of 15, I estimate that the index in which MSM sits, the FTSE 250, has a CAPE ratio today of around 17 (using the latest figure for the CAPE ratio I could find- July 2020 = 14 and multiplying by 1.234 to incorporate the 23.4% increase in FTSE 250 share price since mid-July 2020).


My personal valuation methodology is to discount Buffett’s definition of owner earnings at a rate of 10% to get an absolute value and compare the relative discount to other companies whose fundamentals I believe I understand well.


I believe owner earnings to be marginally higher than reported earnings as capital expenditures on PPE and technology have been slightly below the depreciation and amortisation expense. The majority of that expense is made up of amortisation of intangibles, and the majority of capex is tech investment. It’s my belief that even when accounting for this the valuation is again conservative as some element of the tech investment should be considered growth and not maintenance.


I arrive at a 22% discount to intrinsic value assuming all capex is maintenance and starting with 2019’s owner earnings (£97M reported earnings + £2M adjustment for owner earnings) = £99M, and applying a growth rate in earnings of 8% for 10 years, followed by a 3% growth rate thereafter.


I’ve used an 8% growth rate based on the company’s market growth assumption of 4-5% combined with the historic average increase of earnings above revenue (revenue growth for 5 years pre-COVID averaged 9.4% vs earnings average growth of 13.0%). I also believe that the growth rate has the potential to be higher than this if the business is particularly successful in its B2B or mortgage initiatives.","self","https://redd.it/megsl8"

**Business Description**

CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership that makes and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. They are the only pure play publicly listed North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. They operate two facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas, and East Dubuque, Illinois. CVR Partners’ primary product is UAN, a value-added nitrogen-based fertilizer. UAN is a seasonal product with the primary application taking place in the spring planting season. The proximity of the manufacturing facilities to end markets gives them a freight advantage vs. imports ([UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html)). The Midwest UAN price traded at a $48/t premium to UAN NOLA in Q1/21. 

**Opportunity**

Production of UAN is a high fixed cost business. The operating leverage allows for outsized profits in a favorable commodity market. The price of nitrogen fertilizers tends to slightly lag crop prices - primarily corn and beans. When the price of corn is high, the incremental yield from fertilizing generates more revenue than the cost of the fertilizer. This incentivizes farmers to use more fertilizer. In December 2020, the [price of corn](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/corn-price) rose to a 7-year high and has remained at an elevated price. [Corn futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html) are forecast to stay above $5.00 per bushel through the summer. UAN NOLA prices followed in January 2021 rising from $150/t to ~$278/t for [March delivery](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola-swaps.html). CVR Partners’ breakeven UAN gate price (the point at which there are zero annual distributions to unitholders) is $169/t UAN. Note that this implies a UAN NOLA (Futures Price) of $144-154/t when you factor in their freight advantage. This analysis does not include an in-depth forecast of commodity markets. For simplicity, it’s assumed current commodity future prices remain constant. Use the sensitivity table at the end for returns at your own assumed UAN price. 

**Fertilizer Business Forecast**

The 2021 forecast assumes Q1 actual pricing and the remainder of the year uses pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html). The average gate price for the year is $232/t. If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, current commodity prices support 2021 EBITDA of $220 MM. Using a historical multiple of 8.0x EV / EBITDA implies an EV of $1,758 MM.

I’ve provided a sensitivity table at the end so that you can change the assumptions and come up with your own view on value. 

**A Gift From The Government**

In January 2021, the US government approved [Section 45Q](https://www.projectfinance.law/publications/tax-credits-for-carbon-capture). Section 45Q provides tax credits for carbon capture. CVR Partners sequesters about 1 million metric tons of carbon per year. They indicated on their Q4/20 call and in the [2020 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425292/000142529221000007/cvi-20201231.htm) that they are exploring options to monetize these tax credits. The form of this structure is still unknown, but it seems they will try to time this with the refinancing of their debt in June 2021. If they can monetize these credits, the estimated value of the credits from 2021-25 (the period the current regs cover) is $103MM @ 10% discount rate. If they can claim credits for previous sequestration from 2018-2020, this is an additional $16MM.

**Another Gift From The Government?**

On March 25, 2021, a new [bipartisan bill](https://carboncapturecoalition.org/carbon-capture-coalition-applauds-introduction-of-bipartisan-senate-carbon-capture-utilization-and-storage-tax-credit-amendments-act/) was introduced to the Senate. The bill is sponsored by 6 senators from each side. The proposed bill would change the 45Q CO2 tax credits in 3 important ways: 1) Extends the eligibility period from 2025 to 2030; 2) Sets the new linearly interpolated 2030 tax credit at $75/t in 2030 (from $35/t in 2026 currently); 3) allows for direct tax credit claims from the asset holder which eliminates the need for them to enter into structures with counterparties to receive the credits. It is assumed that this bill will be an amendment to the next Covid bill. It remains to be seen if/when this will pass but the bipartisan sponsorship makes it likely. If the bill becomes law, the value of the CO2 tax credits jumps from $119MM to $316MM. The breakdown of value is as follows:

**9.25% Callable Notes**

CVR Partners has $645M principle 9.25% coupon senior secured notes due in 2023. The notes were issued to fund the acquisition of the East Dubuque plant. These notes are callable in June 2021 without a penalty. The current market yield for [single B issuers](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_high_yield_b_effective_yield) is ~5%. If CVR Partners can refinance the 9.25% senior secured notes with a high yield issue at 5%, this will save them $27M per year in interest. On previous conference calls, management have indicated their intention to refinance these notes in June 2021. With a simple dividend discount model and a 10% cost of equity capital, the incremental value from refinancing the debt is worth the current share price. This forms a compelling value floor for the shares.

**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea, Ammonia) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer in the spring will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

I wrote a DD on a company which can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lt4p75/wlfc\_a\_true\_value\_opportunity\_in\_the\_airline/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lt4p75/wlfc_a_true_value_opportunity_in_the_airline/)

I won't go into huge detail as you can find what you need there. Basically, my hypothesis was proven true and the company tendered a take-private offer, but here's the thing: the offer is bullshit.

They offered cash considerations of $42/share while the intrinsic value of the company is far, far higher. In fact, on February 10, 2020, when the company's intrinsic value was largely the same, they had worked themselves up (since mid-2019) to offer **$62.50/share**. WTF? This is like a 48% premium.

Here is the SEC filing with them offering $62.50/share just over a year ago:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018164/000110465920013072/a20-7229\_1sc13da.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018164/000110465920013072/a20-7229_1sc13da.htm)

Here is the current BS SEC filing:

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1018164/000101816421000019/wlfc-20210319.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1018164/000101816421000019/wlfc-20210319.htm)

So, we have a company who's intrinsic value has largely unchanged but we are getting massive differences in offers. Management has wanted to take this company private for like a decade (I found an interview from 2008 where the CEO laments about how much he hates being a public company) so I know they are motivated to take it private. What are your guys' experience with situations like this? Does management always lowball, the committee responsibly counters, and they work their way up the price ladder until finally shareholders accept? Or, is there a very real possibility shareholders will get fucked here and they will get away with murder?

I am currently assessing the risk of my position. Barring another crisis which decimates the airline industry, the downside is the floor offer of $42/share they have offered, but the ceiling is around $62/share. I just want to know your guys' experience with situations like this and whether or not it's likely shareholders will get a fairer offer or not.","self","https://redd.it/mk2fgy"

Japan-based designer, licensor and producer of consumer products, including brand names such as Hello Kitty and Gudatama.

Hello Kitty is ranked as the #2 highest-grossing media franchise of all time globally, ahead of Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, Super Mario and Winnie the Pooh. Yet the stock is languishing at relatively low levels after the founder's son Kunihiko Tsuji passed away in 2014. 

The company has three separate segments that reinforce each other: self-produced consumer goods, licensing and theme parks. New characters are developed and tested in the theme park segments and sold through the self-owned stores, and finally licensed out to third parties if they are successful.

We believe that Sanrio represents an asset that hasn't yet been fully monetised. The grandson Tomokuni Tusji started taking over day-to-day management of Sanrio from 2019 onwards. His turnaround plan includes the following: setting up an overall marketing department, new digital initiatives such as the Sanrio+ app, a new animation and gaming business with a new Hello Kitty movie coming out. Also new collaborations with Levi's, Razer, Uniqlo, Balenciaga etc. 

Alt-data suggests that the business is picking up momentum. Google Trends data, Subreddit statistics and Instagram likes are all rebounding sharply in the key US and European markets. 

While the theme park and the directly owned stores have suffered from COVID-19, Japan is now in a full vaccination drive that is likely to normalise day-to-day life by the end of 2021. 

Difficult to value Sanrio, but if the turnaround momentum continues at this pace, it is not difficult to envisage significant upside.

China's third-largest telecom operator has been sold down significantly on 5G capex fears, COVID-19, and US sanctions on investor ownership of the shares. At 0.33x EV/Sales, it is now among the most inexpensive of any telecom operator globally.

While the telecom business is competitive, revenue is recurring and the regulator has in the past been relatively hands-off. It is an SOE, and the government is reliant on the dividends paid by its state-owned companies. That makes us confident that they will continue to earn a satisfactory margin.

While the operating margin was only 3.7% in 2020, we think there is significant upside to this number. First, China Unicom has now entered into a partnership with China Telecom to share all 5G capex and base station running costs, thus significantly lowering each company's expense burden from this generation onwards. Second, the capex has been front-loaded and the number of 5G subscriptions is only now starting to accelerate the company's blended ARPU growth. Third, we are most likely in the later stages of COVID-19 with life in China more or less back to normal, meaning individuals will spend less time on household WiFi and instead use wireless data to a higher extent than during the pandemic.

Assuming the operating margin comes back to a level of 5.4%, we foresee an upside of +64% to a 10x EV/EBIT, which is where the stock has traded in the past.

Key Implications?","Strategy",1.0,1,0,0,0,0,"At first blush, David Wichmann's (“W”) departure from $UNH CEO role looked abrupt and the choice of his replacement a head scratcher, but you have to dig a few levels deeper to understand the motives for the Board and the important implications. 

[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/unitedhealth-s-wichmann-to-earn-2-years-salary-bonuses-post-retirement](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/unitedhealth-s-wichmann-to-earn-2-years-salary-bonuses-post-retirement)

1. W was CEO for 3.5 years which is very short compared to the average S&P 500 CEO tenure of 10.2 years. It’s even more exceptional given that prior to W $UNH had had only 3 CEOs in its 40-year history. 

’77 – ’89 Richard Burke (12)

’89 – ’06 William McGuire (17)

’06 – ’17 Stephen Hemsley (11)

’17 – ’21 David Wichmann (4)

2. The Company in its press release did not allow Wichmann to include a statement nor any other Board member congratulated him on his 23-year career with the Company. *UnitedHealth said that Wichmann decided to retire after the pandemic reaffirmed the importance of family for him.* 

3. Ok, so there is little doubt that W was fired. Key question is why? On the surface things were looking pretty good, earnings grew 18.8% ’17-’20 cagr, stock price was up by a similar amount. 

4. Looking one layer deeper, one can say that W was riding on the success of the platform put in place by his predecessor. There is some support for this in the #s – W cut capex % of cash from ops to 11% from >16% in prior periods. On an inorganic basis, he acquired DMG, Equian and CHNG (pending), but none of these were transformative like Catamaran or Amil. 

5. This happened while $UNH peers were successfully catching up. So, from the outside one can speculate that W lost the lead UNH had over its peers. This is significant since $UNH had been several years ahead of peers in its thinking about an integrated healthcare offering. 

6. Next, another unpleasant news came to the fore during W’s tenure. A whistleblower at UNH leaked Steve Nelson’s criticism of Medicare for All. 

[*https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/)

7. This put an unpleasant spotlight on $UNH’s back:

8. Surprisingly, even though Nelson was shortly thereafter let go, W did not come out strongly against Nelson. In fact, he continued to push back against Medicare for All. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-warns-medicare-for-all-would-destabilize-us-health-system.html

9. Finally, a competitor, $CNC started its UK expansion in ’17 and has continued to make further inroads. Why is this relevant? Note, $UNH has had international ambitions for a long time. The 2012 acquisition of Amil hasn’t gone well. Perhaps UK is/was a better market and $UNH is not the first mover? 

[https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene)

10. In conclusion, I think the $UNH board made the right decision. $UNH’s needs to build up its traditional lead over peers and needs to execute on a long-term vision. This vision needs new solutions for better care at lower costs and providing insurance to the un-/under-insured. As importantly, $UNH needs to act boldly and urgently to address the competitive threat from $AMZN, $TDOC and the like. 

11. Is Andrew Witty the right choice to take on these important challenges? The Board definitely thinks so as they’ve been progressing his alongside W as if they’d anticipated this day the moment W was named CEO :)","self","https://redd.it/mnrm97"

//""But there's one investment firm that, for better or worse, seems to  have nailed the new dynamic: ARK Investment. The point was brought home by Twitter user u/ttp_cap in a [thread](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/23510724.83446/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS90dHBfY2FwL3N0YXR1cy8xMzgwNjM0OTYxNTk0Njk5Nzc2P3M9MjA/5e43c5987e5554587e2fe91dB6b0fe3eb) that cites one of our [Odd Lots podcast episodes](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/23510724.83446/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDItMTEvYXJrLXMtaGVhZC1vZi1yZXNlYXJjaC1vbi1ob3ctdGhleS1maW5kLXRoZS1uZXh0LXdpbm5lcj9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDEyMjFfTUtUJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIxMDQxMiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWFya2V0c2FzaWE/5e43c5987e5554587e2fe91dBea197228)  with Brett Winton, who heads research at ARK. In it, Winton outlines   the firm's iconoclastic approach to investment research, noting that for analysts: ""If you are wrong that's fine, as long as you are uniquely wrong ... If you're uniquely wrong everybody thought you were crazy anyway and so it's not priced in ... If your forecasts were on average worse but unique, that is better than having forecasts that are actually closer to the actual truth but the same as everybody else.""

In other words, capturing the collective imagination with an unusual  bull-or-bear-case could be more effective than mounting a  middle-of-the-road argument that might be right, but looks a lot like the consensus. As [u/ttp\_cap](https://www.reddit.com/u/ttp_cap/) puts it: ""In a world where fundamentals + valuation take a back seat  to narrative and momentum, normalizing an absurd moon-shot bull case is extremely important for some stocks,  especially if the past performance of those stocks has been largely  grounded in narrative and momentum."" //","self","https://redd.it/mprm72"

The company's largest shareholder, well-known value investor Phoenix Asset Management, is pushing for a general meeting to remove the Executive Chairman. Multiple well-known funds and large private investors have acquired significant stakes seeing the potential for this vote to pass unlocking substantial amounts of value for shareholders.

The underlying fundamental value is compelling. Dignity has a dominant position in the crematorium market. This section of the market is  growing, as more clients opt for cremations over burials. Competition  within this sector is limited because no-one wants to live next to  crematorium and the capital investment required to build new facilities  is often significant. In most parts of the UK, there is only one  crematoria in the area.

The  company's funeral home strategy has been catastrophic: acquisitions  produced very little volume growth, and aggressive pricing invited a  full investigation from the CMA (now concluded). Pricing has now been  reset, that is in the comps going forward, and with a renewed focus on  shareholder value this division can return to a greater level of profit.

Phoenix  Asset Management own 30% of the company, Granular Capital owns \~10%,  and several well-known centimillionaires own stakes between 3-7%.  Phoenix is, primarily, not an activist fund but will intervene in  management if required. They already have someone on the Board. The  final straw, allegedly, was the discovery of low-integrity sales  practices within the pre-paid funeral division which the Executive  Chairman failed to act on. Phoenix are now pushing for a  spin-off/partial sale of the crematoria division which will realise  immediate value for shareholders, provide the funds to retire debt, and  rebase strategy within both divisions. Phoenix estimated that the value  of the crematoria division in this scenario would be £1bn, roughly 3x  the market cap. This seems bullish, although possible given their  superior information about the business, but even a cursory valuation  suggests a value in the region of \~£750m.

Given the current shareholder list, it seems that management  will have to concede defeat before it comes to a vote (the only reason  they haven't done so already, in my view, is that Phoenix have called  into question the integrity of executive management...in my view,  although Phoenix are not releasing the details, this was not done  lightly).

The risk here is that  the results of the CMA investigation significantly hamper operating  results of the funeral home division, and/or the company fails to  execute properly a turnaround of the funeral home division.

I  would advise that anyone interested go over the CMA Final Report. One  of the main issues for Dignity was that their prices were significantly  higher than the market. The company's acquisitions were failing  dismally, and price increases for a price-insensitive prodcut was an  easy route to growth. The CMA report forced Dignity to reduce prices  significantly, this is undoubtedly the right decision as the company's  previous strategy was not financially unsustainable but wrong.

That  being said, this division is still profitable, and the CMA's measures  to introduce price transparency will reduce future growth but does not  imperil the long-term sustainability of the company's business (the  introduction of licensing should actually help Dignity). Management are  reviewing strategy, this was scheduled for this year but likely won't  happen with the shareholder pressure. As the company comps through the  price drops, the share price will rely heavily on management creating an  effective strategy for funeral homes. This should put the company on a more sustainable  footing and could mean a return to acquistion-led growth - the funeral  home market is still very fragmented - without relying on unsustainable  tricks. To be clear too, from what I have read, the current management  team seem like the wrong people to design this strategy. If the  execution of new strategy goes wrong, there is the risk of further  pressure from regulators so it is important this goes right first time.

In  my opinion, this is one of the most undervalued companies I have seen  for some time. Shares were trading close to 200p in the summer, a market  cap of \~£100m, for a business that is consistenly profitable in double  digits and has very little competition.

The  shares have tripled since then but still look extremely undervalued.  Uncertainty is still hanging over the stock but I think, even in  the unlikely event that management doesn't change, that we get some  form of catalyst to realise value over the next six months. 

At that  point, I think it is worth taking stock, looking at management's  strategy, and asking whether this can grow long-term. The performance of $SCI, the company that DTY was spun out of, should highlight that the competitive dynamics of the industry could be favourable for shareholders. But until management clarifies the strategy, I wouldn't view this as a long-term pick.

Again, just to be clear, this isn't a full valuation or report. This is a summary of the key points, and suggestion for how to guide research. The situation with the CMA report is complex, and the report (which is, imo, essential reading) is over 450 pages, so I would advise starting there after looking at the annual reports.","self","https://redd.it/mqb2je"

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly.

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties.

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID.

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high.

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return.

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround.

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of the properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again.

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world.

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.","self","https://redd.it/mrmngs"

Investment thesis:

* Delfi's brands SilverQueen, Ceres, Delfi, and Goya have been consumed by 4 generations of Indonesians over six decades, building up significant consumer mindshare in the process.
* Indonesians have grown accustomed to the typically less-sweet and less-milky type of chocolate that Delfi is offering. In addition, the company controls a distribution system with access to 400,000 points-of-sale across Indonesia, with a 280 million population and an average age of just 30.
* Chocolate is a growth business. Global chocolate consumption has grown at a 3% CAGR over the past century. And the fundamentals are especially strong for Indonesia. The country’s chocolate consumption is only 1/4 that of Japan and 1/15 that of the United States.
* Delfi’s management team has a decent reputation. The company has paid very generous dividends over the past few decades with an average pay-out ratio of 60%+.
* Delfi’s valuation multiple remains at a huge discount to global peers at just 0.73x sales. The market cap remains a measly US$367 million. Indonesian competitor Mayorah Indah trades at 2.15x. Delfi’s forward PE multiple of 12x is half that of global peers, even though Delfi enjoys a net cash position.
* With CEO John Chuang buying shares in the open market at just below the current share price, I have a high conviction that the shares are currently undervalued.
* Over the past few years, Delfi’s financials have been burdened by a significant depreciation in the Indonesian Rupiah (Delfi reports in US Dollar). It also reduced the number of SKUs by 30-40% from 2015 onwards, hurting top-line growth but improving the potential for higher margins. Several major shareholders such as Mitsubishi and Aberdeen have been trying to sell their stakes since 2018. And finally, Delfi’s general trade segment was hit by COVID-19 in early 2020.
* Most of these factors are temporary. Several of Delfi’s brand names such as SilverQueen are in fact doing very well and in 2018-19 the company enjoyed organic growth rates of 5-10%. I think the company will resume its growth trajectory once the pandemic is over.
* I think that Delfi could eventually get acquired at 2-3x the current price, representing 20-30x PE - in line with global peers. Delfi has been approached by potential buyers several times. I think there is a significant probability that Delfi will eventually be acquired by a multinational.

($TXN)","Discussion",0.96,101,0,1,10,0,"Texas Instruments needs no introductions and is a household name in the tech sector and the broader economy. For those unaware, they are a $176 Billion company that has their hand in all things semiconductor related, their most famous product being the TI-84 scientific calculator. Needless to say, the company is very, *very* old - having been founded in 1930. 

Two fun facts: 

1) They have over 80% of the global calculator market cornered.  

2) The final remnants of the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy process was discovered to be a single account holding Texas Instrument shares valued at $50 Million. 

---

The words ""Tech"" and ""Value"" in the same sentence today are only combined in the form of a bad joke or an oxymoron. However, Texas Instruments is one of the few companies to go against this stigma, trading at a 50% discount to the average multiples for its sector. Despite this, the company has still returned 70% to shareholders for the year, with a hefty 2% dividend yield being the cherry on top. Had you bought in March of 2020, your return would be more akin to almost 100% after dividends. 

Contrasting this enormous growth in share price, the revenues of Texas Instruments have remained steady at a 5-Year CAGR of 2%. They operate in 3 segments - Analog, Embedded Processing, and Other Semiconductor Activities. These segments have had a 5-Year CAGR of 5%, -2%, and -12% respectively. [Here is a graphical representation of the historical growth of the company](https://i.imgur.com/uVths5F.png)

[Consensus estimates are off the wall here](https://i.imgur.com/MQk8tmP.png), and for no justifiable reason. For reference, [here is my own revenue build](https://i.imgur.com/GgpBoos.png) in which I used the standard deviation of quarterly revenues to project a base, bear, and bull case for each segment of the company. As you can see, my numbers are far higher than the historical CAGRs, yet even I am below the consensus estimates for Texas Instruments. I have also [projected an income statement](https://i.imgur.com/FGyiTk5.png) and my EPS is drastically below the street's estimates despite such an aggressive growth rate. I put my COGS assumptions in line with estimates to get closer to baseline but even that wasn't enough. I had to artificially boost my revenue forecasts by 5-10% just to come close. There is no logical explanation for their growth rates. The ""Other Semiconductor Activities"" segment, which is seemingly getting phased out by its declining growth rate, is suddenly jumping into the net positive double digits if the street is right. It makes no sense. 

There are well over 20 firms covering Texas Instruments, and their median estimates have Texas Instruments, a value blue chip stock that has been around for over 90 years, suddenly shifting into a growth-oriented business model and outperforming those 90 years of historicals, all of its competitors, and every benchmark available. I can't figure out what is causing this but I am very bullish on Texas Instruments regardless, and think the semiconductor space as a whole will grow exponentially in the coming years. 

If someone can help me figure out why Wall Street is doubling my own expectations for the sector, please let me know.","self","https://redd.it/mse3ax"

**TLDR; Summary**
Due to recent dramatic increases in dry bulk and container shipping rates and a large quantity of deferred cash payments incoming, it is my belief that SFL will increase their quarterly earnings (and therefore dividend) from $0.15 in Q4 2020 (excluding rig-related items) to $0.20 for Q1 2021, and it may reach as high as $0.25. Should this not occur in Q1 2021, I think it is very likely that it occurs in Q2 2021. When the dividend is increased, the share price is likely to rise above $10.","self","https://redd.it/mtcj9i"

I've modeled a company's financials for the next six years. For the sake example, assume the forecasted operating results are 100% accurate. I have the outputs feeding into a FCF DCF (both levered and unlevered; same data just feeding two seperate tabs) and I'm running into the following problem..

The company generates a lot of cash each period. Its just how their business is right now; they're profitable and capital light. So as it stands, within 3 or 4 years the comapny's cash balance begins to balloon to an unrealistic level. If this were to play out in real life, I'd expect the company to use the cash on small, continuous acquisitions (and therefore presumably grow revs at a rate higher than my original, base projection).

I could obviously model something like that in (e.g. when cash gets above 'x', assume cash outflow for acquisition and plug in 'y' incremental revs on each dollar spent), but the reason I'm spinning my wheels comes back to how I think of FCF DCFs at most basic level.

I've always thought the point of a FCF DCF is to value the cash generated BEFORE any allocation decisions are made. I.e. these are the cash flow are available to the owner/claimholder before any discretionary uses (like an acquisition in this case). 

What do you think? Would you value the company using the original output (runaway cash balance and standalone revs), or would you allocate the cash and assume incremental revs as a described above? Thanks so much in advance","self","https://redd.it/mtvww4"

(**$MRAC**). Very intrigued by their concept of the **mobile store**. They essentially have relationships with vendors like T/AAPL etc. and when a customer orders a product on the partner site, Enjoy delivers it to their home. But instead of just being a delivery service they provide the complete setup and support needed and can also sell select accessories.

I can see how this can be very attractive for less-tech savvy people who struggle with all the gadgets and making them work together.  Even otherwise, this may be a good service, depending on cost to customer, if they can provide convenience and save people from standing in line at at a T-Mobile or Verizon store.

I'm guessing Geek Squad does something similar but not sure about it. Competitive advantage here will come from being a first mover and having superb customer experience both of which they seem to be delivering on (see chart below).

Very interested to hear if anyone has had personal experience with Enjoy. I'll be following this closely as I think this is a very interesting relatively early stage concept.

A year ago we created a discord server to talk about the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, and then we decided to stay! The unofficial [r/SecurityAnalysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/) discord is a place to discuss investments and current events from all over the world, with an emphasis on fundamental security analysis. This is not a place for speculation or penny stocks.  
Since a year ago it's become an active server with quite a few professionals, leading to good discussions, idea generation and scrutiny of ideas. We also have a database and some collected resources.

With the Berkshire annual meeting this weekend we'd like to invite anyone with an interest in security analysis to join us and hopefully stay as well.

I currently hold shares in ASML, I’m very optimistic about the company’s future but I am concerned that the sentiment around semiconductor shortages has driven up their market cap beyond that justified by their future earning potential. 

I’ve updated my DCF to try and find support for the current valuation. In some cases I think I've been overly optimistic in an attempt to justify the current price, but it’s quite a stretch to do so.

I’m trying to justify holding this stock so any feedback is appreciated. If you are still bullish please let me know which assumptions are invalid, where I have been overly conservative or any mistakes.

**Assumptions**

These assumptions are largely based on ASML’s 2018 report (link at the bottom) for which they will be giving an update on their investor day (Sept 29th). Given the changes in the semiconductor sector between 2018 and now it’s possible this is slightly conservative now, so in some cases I have inflated these values.

I have estimated installed base mgmt income will continue to grow at \~5% on average per year.

I have estimated system prices based on the current average NXE:3400 unit cost and estimated the future models price reflects the improvement in performance (\~15-20% for 3600 and \~70% for a EXE:5000). I haven’t modelled the 3800 as this is unknown, but perhaps that could see an additional 10% increase in ticket price.

I haven’t discounted these prices in future as I believe robust demand coupled with lack of competition will enable ASML to maintain prices.

**System Sales**

I’ve very crudely modelled unit sales based on ASML’s 2018 report as well as previous production ramps (e.g. that High-NA EUV will ramp similarly to EUV, although slightly less aggressively due to the constraints on the Zeiss side). I’ve projected a continued decline in DUV immersion sales and a significant ramp in EUV. I haven’t really bothered modelling dry DUV units and just put a flat 2000.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4oi4s36iaw61.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e5910fe579df19ff2bfda77b00ff2ac4a415d8c

These sales numbers align fairly well with my expectations of Samsung, TSMC and Intel’s significant capex projected up to 2025. This would see ASML taking \~$60bn logic sales up to 2025 of their committed \~$200bn capex, which seems close to their recent spends \~30-35% going to ASML.

**Financials**

Based on the unit sales and assumptions above I’ve modelled earnings below. I have modelled a gradual increase in gross margin from the current 50% up to 55% in 2025 to reflect the high demand and shifting product mix towards EUV.

https://preview.redd.it/uu1om337iaw61.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=e481499ad00960c9766ffd1543b82b47c85c6c36

These align fairly well with the upper end of ASML’s 2018 estimate for 2025 sales (14-25bn), which I am confident they will hit given the extreme demand and their near-perfect execution to date.

**Valuation**

I’ve modelled the intrinsic value of ASML in 4 different ways. Using 2025-terminal earnings (which I am relatively confident in and 2030-terminal earnings, which I have much less confidence in. For each I have modelled using a perpetual growth rate of 2% or an exit P/E of 25.

I’ve used a fairly generous discount rate of 6% as I believe ASML to be highly reliable and relatively low risk. I also think current low interest rates and low equity risk premium justify a lower discount rate.

https://preview.redd.it/y46ir3aziaw61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=7336882f59001ac72fd3a7ef5e9ba61d62b00c9e

All of these models put ASML’s intrinsic value below current market cap. To change my assumptions to get closer the current market cap requires one of a few things:

**Significant growth in system sales** \- this feels somewhat unlikely, I don’t think they will have capacity for this and are constrained by Zeiss on the optics.

**Significant growth in system prices** \- perhaps in the short term if Intel/TSMC/Samsung are all desperate to get EUV capacity, but that seems unlikely to persist.

**Increased perpetual growth rate** \- This is probably the biggest unknown and the potential for the greatest value. There isn’t a roadmap beyond high-NA (except increasing beyond NA=0.55) but ASML seems best equipped to lead whatever comes next in lithography.

**Conclusion**

These models suggest ASML is currently overbought, which feels like a strong possibility given the amount of hype around semiconductors in general and the huge amount of capex planned by the EUV foundries.

If this current market elation is part of a continued growth trend for significant semiconductor demand and corresponding capex then perhaps my model is too conservative.

If however this is just a cyclical uptick and the semiconductor foundries will experience a period of digestion once supply constraints are met then perhaps ASML is indeed overbought.

[https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/298365-its-not-a-semiconductor-shortage-its-demand-delirium-poor-planning/](https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/298365-its-not-a-semiconductor-shortage-its-demand-delirium-poor-planning/)

The biggest unknown in my mind is beyond 2030. If we really don’t find a way past current lithography/silicon limits then what does that mean for ASML and its customers. EUV has perhaps one more swing with some higher NA (\~0.75) solution but then we hit physical constraints (in lithography and silicon) - it’s hard to know what position this puts ASML in.

**Discussion**

* What happens beyond 0.55 NA, will we see ‘higher-NA’, I know higher values have been considered but come with a whole host of challenges, but what comes after that?
* Will competition for EUV capacity between Intel, Samsung, TSMC in the coming \~2-3 years increase prices?
* Will restrictions on EUV sales to China ease, further increasing demand?
* Will China attempt to copy EUV, eroding ASML’s monopoly?

I’d like an excuse to hold this stock because ASML is the gatekeeper to almost all significant trends (AI/ML, computer-vision, autonomous driving, IoT, drones, Blockchain/Crypto, cloud), however I think the current price represents overexuberance for semiconductors in general and ASML specifically.

I’d be surprised if there wasn’t a better entry point by 2025 as supply constraints on semiconductors ease and foundry capex declines and it seems unlikely ASML earnings will grow quick enough to justify the current price.

What happened? One of the risks I mentioned, the possibility of the company being hit severely by the Coronavirus epidemic became a reality. In hindsight, something that could have been expected. Results for the entire year have been terrible. Today the stock dropped 13% on results that showed a net loss for Q1. This Q1 loss I theorize is due to a lack of ordering supplies for the new year, primarily due to product stock from last year still remaining. According to the company, recovery is underway. According to Q4 there does seem to be a slight uptick. Further results are necessary, but it's safe to assume 2021 is going to be a terrible year, recovery to old values in 2022 is the most optimistic scenario possible.

Further bad news came in the form of growth (or lack thereof) in new medications, as the company is reliant on diversification in order to retain it's profitability in the future beyond 2026. The company is still developing it's Insulin products, but the various products in the form of Vascular Disease medications are not growing at favorable rates.

The company's future value, as of yet, has lost a relatively small amount in my view. Value probably went from roughly HKD45 to perhaps HKD30 considering the growth that will be missed for 2020/2021. Since the stock price has not gone above HKD15 or so, the stock has still been a good buy.

Actions to take now depend on risk profile. A possible risk with HKD15 a share investment is that the majority shareholder has been continuing it's aggressive purchase of shares. It's entirely possible that this shareholder could decide to take the company private (if possible) for less than HKD15/share. This is also China, the risk being fleeced with a bankruptcy (which the majority shareholder would, under normal circumstances, never allow to happen) is not outside of the realm of possibility.

My strategy will be to wait for a further drop in price, and in case of an increase I would be willing to sell the shares I own around HKD8-10. I was merely waiting for the Q1 results, so that I had the assurance that 2021 was, indeed, going to be a bad year. Hopefully price will crash to rock bottom so there's great value to be had, as I ultimately believe the stock to still be greatly undervalued. It just won't realize it's value until possibly 2024-2025. Kewei Granules patent expiring 2026 will be closer, although my theory is that this won't immediately affect the company, and they still have a good few years of aggressive growth left for this product. I could be entirely wrong here. As the company has seemed (in the past) to be resistant to financial turmoil, the coming crash (Which I believe will happen... when I do not know) will hopefully prove to not affect the company severely.

The coronavirus is still on the table when it comes to risk. I have full faith that the Chinese will tackle this virus, even in the event of vaccines turning out the be less effective over the long term. China will most likely not allow the virus to ever make it's return, unlike many other governments in the world. 2-month lockdowns without mass hospitalizations will most likely not affect the company greatly. Worst case scenario, however, could result in wishing that one would have invested in JD or Amazon instead.

Valuable numbers right now are particularly the Book Value/Tangible Book Value per share. With roughly 6.60 HKD Book Value and 3 HKD Tangible Book Value per share (Around 1.1/2.5 Ratios) it's clear that a price below 6.60 HKD would be great, and below 3 HKD is probably too good to be true. Who knows how far and hard it will drop, however.

Would be happy to discuss any flaws in my reasoning, or any new ideas. I am sorry that this has not been a very ""number heavy"" post. But I find that Sales/Profit figures are simply best described as ""Bad until recovery from Corona sets in"". The company's fundamental business model has not been affected.","self","https://redd.it/n25rhp"

But I feel like the thesis holds up even if you remove the speculative part. Anyways, here it is: 

At \~ $65 a share, eHealth (ticker: EHTH) , an insurance brokerage in the Medicare Space, represents an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity and represents an opportunity to buy shares that are possibly artificially depressed. On April 29th, EHTH had their earnings call and had overwhelmingly positive results. They are showing improving fundamentals, beat top line estimates, and beat earnings estimates. On April 30th, their price jump 10% and then on that same day, see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price. I believe that the stock price didn't stay up because:

* Negative Sentiment from the Muddy Waters Report still lingering (including misunderstanding accounting, I can comment on this more in the comments)
* Momentum traders who see the stock price plummet and think it'll continue to plummet
* Possibly HIG Capital who might be pushing the stock price down so that they get a favorable conversion price when converting preferred shares to equity

**Who is eHealth?**

eHealth is an insurance brokerage. Insurance companies use brokerages like eHealth and its competitors to sell insurance to individuals, families, and small businesses. As long as the people stay active (aka pay their premiums) to the insurance companies, the insurance companies pay a commission over to the brokerages. So the more people they enroll into a plan, and the longer they stay, the more they earn.

eHealth operates their business in two segments: (1) Medicare, and (2) Individual, Family and Small Business. The Medicare segment represents the majority of the business and constituted approximately 89%, and 88% of revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Medicare-related health insurance plans including medicare advantage, medicare supplement, and medicare part D prescription drug plans.

The biggest bulk of their business is from the Medicare Advantage Insurance Plans so I’ll talk about that market really quickly. Medicare Advantage is a health insurance alternative to the Original Medicare. These Plans may have lower out-of- pocket costs than Original Medicare, which is why people prefer this over the original. Generally, people aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare.

So how big is the total addressable market? Well, according to their annual report, there are “10,000 people on average turning 65 **every day** over the next ten years”. This translates to approximately 3.65M new potential enrollees per year. eHealth and its competitors all claim that the market is growing quickly and that they’ve barely tapped the market. In 2020, eHealth approved only 387k members (approximately 1% of people eligible). Its direct competitors, GoHealth and SelectQuote, have made similar claims about the size of the market and have comparable market share.

Additionally, eHealth has ecommerce platforms that organize and present health insurance information in various formats that enable individuals, families, and small businesses to research, analyze, compare, and purchase a range of health insurance plans. As each year passes, new annual cohorts of eligible seniors become more tech savvy. As the market transitions online, eHealth’s cost of acquisitions decreases.

**So what is eHealth worth?**

As briefly mentioned eHealth spends money upfront to acquire a new member for Insurance Companies, and throughout the life of the policy, the insurance companies pay eHealth in the form of commissions. In light of the business model, the key metrics the company uses for each business segment is:

* Approved Members - represents the number of individuals on submitted applications that were approved by the relevant insurance carrier for the identified product during the current period.
* Lifetime Value (LTV) – Estimated Monthly Commissions x Estimated Months the policy will be active
* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – Average cost to acquire a new member through different channels such as the ecommerce platform or through TV ads.

Using the averages for these metrics from 2017 to 2020, I do the sum of the parts valuation below:

Valuation

I think the valuation might be conservative because:

* The multiple I used is low relative to my expectations of growth
* CAC should decrease relative to historical because more members are being acquired through the ecommerce platform rather than more costly channels
* Management has expressed that they are trying to control the fixed expenses and historical have shown it go down as a % of revenues YOY.

**Why do I think HIG Capital is holding the stock down?**

Now we get to the speculative part. Since the stock’s big drop in late January (missed Q4 earnings estimates), the stock has been trending upwards. Notable upward pricing movements have been caused by SEC filings revealing that some well -established activist value funds (Starboard Value and Hudson Executive Capital) have entered positions into EHTH. Then, on April 29, EHTH ended the day on $70 a share and released its Q1 earnings results after hours. It was overwhelmingly positive. EHTH outperformed and beat its top line and earnings estimates.

So what happened on April 30th? The stock price started off strong and rose 10% to about $77 a share and then started cratering by 9:40, ending the day at $71 a share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8rjrliw3px61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23ce053cae15319bef808a91c3aee7177b464e48

Why? HIG Capital just so happens to finalize its $225 million investment of convertible stocks in EHTH on April 30th. See the filing date below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vq4obp7x3px61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=1222060e32d8c2470e27bc70d374f3824b1dae91

Reading the terms of the agreement, it looks beneficial for HIG to have EHTH’s stock price be depressed until May 31st. The reason is because of the conversion terms. After May 31st, HIG gets to convert their investment of $225M preferred stock into equity based on the following formula:

Shares of Equity = Accrued Value of Preferred Stock/Conversion Price

Per the investment agreement, the conversion price is 125% X the Arithmetic Price Average for 120 days following January 29, 2021, subject to a max of $90 and a min of $50. So the lower the conversion price, the more shares of Equity they get. Conversely, the higher the conversion price, the less shares they get.

Further evidence of this can be seen in abnormal trading volumes since the day of the earnings report:

I’m speculating that it’s HIG doing it because there’s no other noticeable market participant (other than MW) that would want to push the stock price down. Additionally, I think it’s only one party than a coordinate group of individuals all coincidentally pushing trades at the same time to cause several Millions of dollars’ worth of EHTH stock to be traded at any given time. I mean, the amount of money from these trades is almost $20M.

**So what?**

Anyone buying shares would be able to buy shares of EHTH at artificially depressed prices. Furthermore, if enough demand pushes the price high enough, then it could push HIG's conversion price to increase, causing less of the value to be accretive to HIG and more to common equity. So if the stock price goes up, equity investors gains on two fronts!

**Risks:**

Investing has risks and you can lose money. From a fundamentals standpoint, EHTH:

* Might not be able to maintain or Increase its approved members or LTV
* Might not be able to maintain or decrease its CAC
* Might be affected negatively by other externalities such as regulation

Additionally, HIG might be able to pull off a conversion that’s value accretive from equity investors to them.

Finally, my thesis on HIG is highly speculative and I could be completely off on this one. It really could be because there are other big investors that don't believe in EHTH anymore...

**Disclaimer:**

I may have made mistakes in my analysis or I might have missed information. You should do your own research. Nothing in this post should be construed as investment advice and is purely for entertainment purposes. I have call options in EHTH. Also, I’m not a great proofreader so I might have typos…

**TLDR:**

* Valued EHTH at more than $100
* Speculating that HIG Capital is artificially pushing the stock price down because of its investment in preferred stock
* They want to keep the stock price depressed to they can convert for more equity shares and have more value accretive to them
* Because of their hanky-panky, we are presented with an attractive opportunity to buy the stock at depressed prices and potentially push the stock price up high enough that it’s more value accretive to us than to HIG","self","https://redd.it/n6xx68"

Betterware de Mexico is a leading direct-to-consumer marketplace and platform business in Mexico that sells home organization and cleaning products. It is the first Mexican company to ever directly list on the NASDAQ. Betterware’s product portfolio falls under 6 categories (ranked according to % of sales): kitchen (35%), home (20%), bathroom (12%), laundry & cleaning (11%), commuting (11%), and bedroom (11%). The company sells its products through a unique two-tier sales model that consists of 59,700+ distributors and 1.2+ million associates with a 20% household penetration across Mexico.

Betterware has 60% gross margins and returns on tangible capital, generates abundant free cash flow, and pays a 4% dividend. The business grew at over 50% annualized over the last 5 years and generated $350 million in revenue and $77 million in net income in 2020. The founding family oversees operations and owns half of the company, a stake worth over $750 million USD. The company is expected to continue growing well above 40% a year for the next several years thanks to a long growth runway remaining in Mexico and nearby Latin American countries. The stock trades at a very undervalued 14x earnings at a $1.7 billion market cap due to lack of investor awareness. We believe the company is worth at least 100% to 150% more.

**- Business History -**

Betterware began as the Mexican subsidiary of the British company Betterware Limited. Betterware Limited sold a variety of household products in the UK and decided to expand into Latin America. Unfortunately, the venture performed poorly because the British parent did not tailor the business model to fit Latin America’s unique cultural and demographic characteristics (which will be explained later). This created the opportunity that led to Luis Campos, Betterware de Mexico’s current chairman and 50% owner, acquiring this subsidiary and establishing it as Betterware de Mexico. Mr. Campos was uniquely positioned to revitalize this distressed company due to his extensive background in consumer goods businesses in Latin America. His storied career included being the former chairman at various multinational corporations, including Hasbro Mexico, Sara Lee Mexico, and Tupperware Americas. Mr. Campos completely reshaped the business to fit Latin American culture and laid the groundwork that enabled the company to achieve its spectacular future results.

Under his leadership, Betterware’s revenue and EBITDA grew over 60-fold and 120-fold, respectively, over the last twenty years (23%+ annualized). In addition, the company’s distribution network grew from 200 distributors to over 59,000 and from 5,000 associates to over 1.2 million. In March 2020, the company went public via SPAC. Dr. Martin Werner, the former head of Goldman Sachs’s LatAm investment banking division, led the deal. In its first calendar year as a public company (2020), Betterware grew revenues by 130% and EBITDA by 147%. The business’s growth, profitability, and execution have been stellar under Campos’s oversight. Looking ahead, Betterware is aiming to expand globally, starting with other Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, and Colombia.

**- Business Model & Competitive Advantages -**

As mentioned earlier, Betterware employs a direct-to-consumer sales strategy. In contrast, in traditional retail, products move in the following sequence: manufacturer → wholesaler → distributor → retailer → customer. Betterware’s model involves none of these middlemen or external parties between the company and its customers. As a result, the company is able to offer extremely affordable prices across its product portfolio (average item price is $5). Customers order products, and Betterware controls the entire process ranging from manufacturing to distribution (via the distributors and associates) to the final product sale. Betterware designs products in-house, manufactures them in Asia, and delivers them to distributors. Both distributors and associates deliver the products directly to the customer. This allows the company to minimize its shipping and last-mile delivery costs. 

Betterware sells its products through 9 catalogs a year that are published roughly every 6 weeks. The catalog is accessible via a 100-page physical booklet, the e-commerce site ([https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/](https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/)), and the iOS/Android app. The firm is constantly innovating and introduces around 300 new products each year while replacing underperforming products. The e-commerce site launched in December 2020 and helped accelerate sales that month by 301% YoY and EBITDA by 417% YoY.

Products are delivered from the company’s distribution center to the distributor through whom the order was placed. The distributor has groups of associates who work for them, and the associates deliver the products to the customer. Therefore, the company itself has 0 last mile delivery costs, as its distributors and associates deliver the products to the final consumers. This is one key competitive advantage in Mexico due to last-mile delivery costs being exorbitant, especially to rural areas.

Four other factors further solidify Betterware’s competitive position in the market:

First, Betterware offers payment flexibility by accepting both cash and credit. 70% of transactions in Mexico are made in cash, while only 30% are made on credit. In addition, less than a third of Mexicans have a bank account and even less use a debit or credit card. This makes the ability to accept cash important, as well as problematic for many other e-commerce retailers who have attempted expansion in Mexico and Latin America. At the same time, the ability to pay via credit on Betterware’s e-commerce site is also important because it allows the company to have direct exposure to the trend of financial transactions becoming increasingly digital around the world.

Second, the company’s platform continues to grow in its scale and reach over time. The firm has grown at over 20%+ annualized for 2 decades, with annual growth accelerating in the past 5 years in excess of 40%. With 1.3 million total distributors and associates, Betterware products are now sold by nearly 1.5% of Mexico’s working population. As more people continue to buy products, the company is also able to better introduce new items that will be in demand thanks to the ability to analyze the millions of transactions taking place.

Third, the business performs exceptionally well during economic downturns. Many Mexican residents become associates or distributors to earn additional income during a recession. Furthermore, due to the low average product sales price, customers are likely to cut other areas of spending from their budgets before reducing their Betterware purchases. As a result of these two attributes, the business model is extremely resilient to recessions.

Last but not least, Betterware is run by a high quality founder-led management team. The Campos family owns 18,438,770 shares, a 50.1% stake worth over $700 million USD today. They have not sold a single share since the company went public, despite the value of their stake rising from \~$144 million. Additionally, the Campos family takes no compensation directly from the company. Instead, their entire $33 million USD annual income is derived from the company’s dividends. Because of this, the Campos family is aligned with the interests of current shareholders.

**- Cultural & Geographic Relevance -**

Betterware’s business model is tailored to perfectly fit Mexico’s unique cultural and geographical dynamics. For starters, family is one of the most important elements in Mexican society and is an essential safety net of help and protection. Families are typically large, especially in the rural communities that dominate Mexico’s population. Furthermore, decorating and maintaining a home is very important, as family gatherings are a large part of Mexican life.

These characteristics point us back to the two reasons why the British sales model was ineffective. First, their approach was impersonal. Associates were assigned to specific residential neighborhoods and dropped off physical catalogs in every mailbox. Residents could write down their orders and leave it back in the mailbox. Since the associate had no personal connection with these potential customers, this was not an effective strategy. This is why the change in Betterware’s sales model, implemented by Luis Campos, worked so well. As a result, a Betterware associate is usually a customer themselves first, then sells products to family, co-workers, and close friends. Given the strong family ties and loyalty among these groups, many people make a strong effort to order Betterware products through their friends or family members. 

Second, the original product catalog tailored more to the average British consumer rather than those in Mexico. To rectify this, Betterware focused its product portfolio on items that help organize, save space, or maintain a clean home because of the cultural importance of family and the home in Mexico and Latin America.

Thus, Betterware succeeded where its British parent failed, by capitalizing on Mexico’s family-oriented culture and creating a product line that focused on home organization and cleanliness.

**- Valuation -**

Betterware generated $350 million in revenue, $104 million in EBITDA, and $76.5 million in net income. The business also has 60% gross margins, 60% normalized returns on tangible capital, and net cash on the balance sheet. 2021 guidance points to $500 million in revenue, $148 million in EBITDA, and $112 million in net income.

At a $1.4 billion market cap, the stock trades at 12.5x 2021 earnings. This is an incredibly low valuation for a company that has grown at 40%+ annualized for the last 5 years and 135% in 2020. Furthermore, the management team, which has a reputation for being conservative, has guided to 45% revenue growth for 2021. This is likely extremely understated as the business exited 2020 growing at over 300% YoY, and 3rd party sources indicate that growth has remained elevated. The company also announced its annual dividend for 2021 of \~$67 million USD, which is roughly 66% of 2021 free cash flow, based on management’s guidance. With the business growing in excess of 40% a year, the dividend should keep growing annually. A 5% dividend yield is usually found in stable, mature, or distressed companies, not in asset-light platform businesses growing at high rates. Betterware also trades at 50% to 75%+ discounts to other Latin American platform and DTC businesses like MercadoLibre and Tupperware.

Additionally, Betterware has a strong runway to maintain its  growth. First, it only has 20% market share in Mexico and is expanding into surrounding Latin American countries including Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Second, Betterware only has about 20% wallet share at the moment. The company expects to grow this by introducing new products into the catalog to capture more of a typical family’s spending on home-related items.

Asset-light platform businesses with high growth tend to trade at large multiples and often for good reason. Betterware has all of these characteristics and profitability. It is also returning cash to shareholders via the annual dividend. If we assign even a 30x earnings multiple on Betterware’s 2021 earnings, it is over a $100 stock vs. $38 currently. Even ignoring the 135% revenue growth and even higher profitability growth in 2020, companies growing profitably at 45% a year tend to trade well above 50x earnings. At that price, BWMX is a $150 stock. To reiterate, all of these multiples are based on management’s forward guidance, which is extremely conservative.

We expect BWMX shares to increase from $45 to $100$120 in the next 6 to 18 months. If the market rewards BWMX in the same way it has other platform/marketplace companies, we can expect an upside target of over $200.

Q1 report was last night....blowout numbers again....stock has barely yawned.

**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights ($USD):**  


* $144 million revenue (+205% YoY)
* $46 million EBITDA (+287% YoY)
* 31.8% EBITDA margin (vs. 25% Q1 2020)
* $32 million net income (+339% YoY - excluding currency hedging YoY, +578% growth)

**FY2021 Guidance (+10% from last update)**  


* $552 million revenue (+60% YoY)
* $164 million EBITDA (+57% YoY)
* $124 million net income (+62% YoY)
* $106 million free cash flow (+77% YoY)
* $70 million USD dividend, remains same (3.9% yield)
* 14x P/E
* 10x EV/EBITDA

\- Guatemala expansion revenue up 382% YoY with 25% EBITDA

\- On track to expand into Peru and Colombia over next 2 years

Majority of 2021 CAPEX is related to the new headquarters/distribution center and other technology growth investments tied to that. Normalized free cash flow would be at least $10 million higher than shown here.

Here are some pics of the new facilities posted on the Twitter page of the governor of Jalisco (Mexican state where the new HQ/logistics operations are located):

Harbor Diversified (OTC: HRBR) is one of the strongest risk-reward opportunities on the market today. Harbor diversified is a non-operating entity that owns Air Wisconsin – a U.S. domestic regional airline that remains undiscovered and undervalued by the market. A 400% upside to the current share price of $1.84 is easily achievable based on the company’s existing economics being fully understood and realized by the market.

**Mispricing**

* This opportunity exists because of the dynamics surrounding how this security became publicly traded and the fact that it is an illiquid micro-cap security trading on OTC markets.
* Air Wisconsin (AirWis) became Harbor Diversified, Inc. via a merger in 2011 with Harbor Biosciences, a cash-burning pharma business with substantial NOLs and deferred tax assets for the profitable AirWis to take advantage of.
* HRBR went dark and ceased to publish filings with the SEC, leaving investors unaware of the merger. Nine years later, an investor Travis Martin learned of this merger and filed a lawsuit demanding that HRBR release financials, as they had >300 shareholders.
* Consequently, HRBR released its 2019 10-K in July 2020, revealing an **undiscovered airline IPO** that lacked the fanfare and marketing of a traditional IPO process.
* Over the past few months, we have learned about the company in bits and pieces via quarterly filings, with the 2020 10-K being released on April 1, 2021. **Given these facts, AirWis trades at 1.2x 2020 EBITDAR, 0.5x 2020 revenue, 3.3x 2020 earnings, 0.7x year-end 2020 book value, and generates a 61% free cash flow yield.**

**Business**

* HRBR is a holding company that now consists solely of AirWis and the NOLs of the pharma business ($19.1 million of DTAs); the remainder of the pharma business was liquidated.
* It owns 64 CRJ-200 aircrafts and flew four million passengers annually pre-pandemic.
* The company operates under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with United Airlines (UAL), in which AirWis serves as a United Express regional carrier.
* AirWis operates routes to 36 cities across the US, all of which depart from or arrive at two UAL hubs: Chicago O’Hare and Washington Dulles.
* Market cap of $100 million and generated $185.9 million of revenue in 2020 at a 23.3% EBIT margin and a 41.6% EBITDAR margin.
* $76.9 million of net cash and trades at **0.5x today’s book value**. AirWis generated $1.11 in FCF per share in 2020.
* Trades at 1.2x 2020 EBITDAR, **0.5x 2020 revenue**, 2.5x 2020 earnings, 0.7x year-end 2020 book value, and generates a 61% free cash flow yield.

**Industry**

* Regional airlines provide aircraft, fleet maintenance, and crew; the larger airlines pay for fuel and aircraft insurance, sell tickets, and plan routes. A typical contract compensates the regional airline on the basis of operating statistics such as number of departures, timeliness, customer satisfaction, and available seat miles (ASM).
* Regional airline industry relies primarily on leisure travel. This industry will benefit immensely upon the economy reopening, with pent-up leisure travel demand serving as a tailwind for the latter half of 2021 into early 2022.
* Air Wisconsin strategically anticipated this by announcing 5 new routes departing from Milwaukee: to Charleston, South Carolina; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; Portland, Maine and Savannah, Georgia.

**AirWis has strong unit economics because of the UAL contract**

* On an ASM basis, AirWis earns $90 in EBITDAR per ASM, compared with \~$20 for regional CPA peers Skywest Airlines and Mesa Airlines.
* In October 2020, AirWis’s contract with UAL was renegotiated and incentive-based components were suspended, tying the economics of the contract entirely to the operating statistics plus a fixed payment, regardless of flight volumes.
* The contract provides an extension until February 2023, with two renewal options to 2025 and to 2027. Pre-contract renewal, AirWis earned $35 per ASM, compared to \~$20 for peers. **It is clear that AirWis had superior contract economics before the pandemic and obtained even better terms with UAL during the pandemic.**
* AirWis saw more favorable EBITDAR margins with an astonishing 41.6%, far outpacing Mesa’s 13.1% and Skywest’s 11.2%.
* AirWis’s contract economics are stronger than peers because of the history between the two companies and the flight route economics. AirWis has been flying as a United Express carrier since the early 1980s and pioneered the concept of codesharing as a regional air carrier. Their relationship with United is far more entrenched than Skywest’s, who started serving UAL in the early 2000s, and Mesa’s, who started serving UAL in the late 1990s.
* Furthermore, AirWis’s flight routes out of IAD operate at near monopoly status with greater passenger density, given that United is the only airline with a hub at Dulles (comparatively, Mesa and Skywest operate primarily out of more “crowded” hubs, e.g. LAX, where UAL, DAL, and AAL all share a hub). AirWis’s routes out of IAD have shorter distances comparatively, yet still command price premiums given the monopolized status of these routes. **Thus, given the long and favorable history of service between UAL and AirWis, and the fact that the routes AirWis serves operate as monopolies with high passenger density, AirWis has been able to achieve superior contract economics than peers.**

**Government support has provided substantial cash**

* AirWis received a total of $42 million from the US government in 2020 from the CARES Act PSP1 and another $10 million from the PPP loan.
* This year’s strong earnings, largely driven by government support and reduction of lease expense, enabled AirWis to increase its cash balance from $69 million to $130 million during 2020 without raising any debt aside from the PPP loan.
* AirWis will receive a further $60.1 million in 2021 from the US government through PSP2 and PSP3, according to the US Treasury. With this government support, AirWis will earn 1.0x its market cap in net income this year.
* AirWis is extremely unlevered compared to peers, sitting at a net debt/EBITDAR of (1.0x) compared to peers Mesa and Skywest with 5.0x and 8.8x, respectively.
* As of the announcement of PSP2 and PSP3, **AirWis has $72.9 million of net cash (incl. leases).** **This towering net cash balance will create the opportunity for AirWis management to deliver cash back to shareholders via a special dividend or share repurchases**.

**AirWis will become profitable on a normalized basis due to lease purchases**

* In 2021, earnings will be stronger than in 2020, but these numbers are not indicative of AirWis’s future earnings power due to the enormous amount of impending government support.
* On a normalized basis, using 2019 flight volumes, AirWis will generate $20 million in annual unlevered net income, for a \~8% net income margin. This margin improvement is substantial over pre-pandemic levels, which were razor thin when factoring in one-time add-backs. The improvement is purely driven by the elimination of $40 million in annual rent expense with an incremental step-up in depreciation. **This move by management was clearly margin-accretive for the business; normalized earnings will be profitable.**

**Valuation – Book Value Approach**

* Year-end 2020, AirWis had $2.12 of book value per share. For today’s book value, we add back current and long-term deferred revenue ($43.2m), which will come in as earnings in 2021. We also add back the $10m PPP loan, which is forgivable. We arrive at an adjusted book value of $3.09 per share. On top of this, AirWis will receive $60.1 million from PSP2 and PSP3 to offset payroll in 2021. Adjusting for PSP2 and PSP3, we arrive at our base case of $4.19 per share.
* Furthermore, pre-owned CRJ-200s sell for $1.3 million. Even if HRBR were to liquidate, selling the 64 aircraft at 75% of the market price would generate enough cash to cover the market cap. Adding in the $76.9 million of net cash would yield a share price of $2.51.

**Valuation – Earnings Power Approach**

* At normalized net income of $20 million, applying a 10x multiple and assuming a dollar-for-dollar conversion of $76.9 million in net cash, we arrive at a $5.84 share price.
* At 14x, we obtain a $7.30 share price.
* **The discrepancy in price and value for this business is too large to ignore.**

**Catalysts**

* The primary catalyst for a rerating is capital allocation. The majority shareholder in the business is Richard Bartlett, who controls 26% of shares outstanding.
* Inside ownership is 36%, demonstrating strong alignment of incentives. Management has chosen to stay in the dark for 9 years, but after posting strong financial results and attracting substantial investor interest, they cannot remain in the shadows.
* Management has announced a share buyback program, where they will set aside an additional $1 million each month to repurchase shares. \~$13 million, an astounding 20% of market cap, has already been set aside for the program.
* While shares have yet to be repurchased, management is creating a war chest whose value will soon be unlocked by shareholders. Another capital allocation-related catalyst would be the announcement of a special dividend.
* **With $76.9 million in net cash and a $65 million market cap, simple capital allocation decisions surrounding a dividend or repurchases would prove to be imminent and tangible catalysts, prompting a proper multiple rerating.**
* The “call option” catalyst is an uplisting to a major stock exchange from their current OTC existence.
* An additional catalyst is the release of the next quarterly filing. The disclosure of $60.1 million of government funding from PSP 2&3 causing net cash balance to explode from $6.8 million year-end 2020 to $76.9 million today will be an eye-opening result to investors.

**Conclusion**

HRBR is worth base case $5.84 and bull case $7.30. The share price will increase as a result of upcoming earnings announcements, which will point out the fact that the business received a $61m check in cold hard cash from the government earlier in 2021. Dividends and share buybacks will provide further upside potential. Overall, Air Wisconsin provides one of the strongest risk-reward opportunities in the market today, with a substantial margin of safety with downside protection.

The company had the unfortunate luck of going public at the end of March 2021 and faced a very tough tech IPO market to say the least. Nonetheless, Vizio’s reputation as a hardware company masks its small, but rapidly growing and extremely profitable advertising business that has grown at over 100% a year since it was established in 2018. Taking advantage of its large market share in TVs, the company is finally ramping up its ability to monetize the millions of daily users of its SmartCast operating system (found on every Vizio television). Essentially, Vizio is getting paid every time a user turns on the TV (and more) and is following a template already established by Roku. Vizio sold 17.1 million smart TVs between 2018 and 2020 and grew its active SmartCast accounts from 3.6 to 12.2 million accounts over that same time frame (a strong 70% conversion rate). 

To put the contrasting economics into perspective, in 2020, Vizio’s hardware business had 10% gross margins, contributed to 93% of total sales and 62% of total gross profit, and grew 7% YoY. Meanwhile, its SmartCast platform/advertising business had 76% gross margins (up from 60% in 2018), contributed to only 7% of total sales but 38% of total gross profit, and grew at 132% YoY. The growth in the high margin platform/ad business propelled total net income to expand more than 4x from $23 million in 2019 to $103 million in 2020 ($41 million of which was in Q4 2020 alone). Growth should remain strong for years to come, as the company has barely scratched the surface with monetizing its SmartCast platform.

At its current market cap of $4.6 billion (\~$25 a share), Vizio trades at 2x sales, 20x forward earnings, and has over $300 million in cash with no debt. As investor awareness improves regarding the high growth software platform, the stock's multiple should expand significantly and narrow the valuation gap with peers like Roku. Shares are easily worth 2x to 4x the current price. The company offers investors a compelling opportunity to gain exposure to the connected TV advertising market, which is projected to grow from $9 billion to $28 billion between 2020 and 2025. For a little preview of what VZIO could become (but on a smaller scale), take a look at a 5-year graph of ROKU ($18 → $300+).","self","https://redd.it/n98del"

The company is the 3rd largest player (by a large margin) in the fragmented connected fitness industry. The business, led by a new CEO, has executed on a transformational turnaround in its business model. It has shifted away from being a cyclical fitness equipment maker and towards becoming a high margin, subscription-oriented connected fitness company. The redesigned products have been selling extremely well, and the connected fitness subscription numbers are growing at triple digits (albeit from a small base). 

The company is valued at less than 1x sales, 7x earnings, and has 20% of its market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. The stock trades at over a 75% discount compared to public and private peers including Peloton, NordicTrack, Tonal, Tempo, and more.

Q1 numbers reported yesterday afternoon.

Excellent numbers and forward guidance confirms my viewpoint that the company has transformed its business, and at-home fitness is not going anywhere.  


I am also hopeful that they can capitalize on the fact that their treadmills aren't killing children and injuring adults (referencing the mess Peloton has found itself in).

  
**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights:**  


* $206.1 million revenue (+121% YoY) 
   * \+143.3% YoY excluding divested Octane Fitness commercial business (sold last October)
   * Blew past Q1 guidance of $145 million to $165 million (+55% to 75% YoY)
   * highest quarterly sales in 35-year company history
* $30.4 million net income (vs. $2.2 million Q1 2020)  

* $0.93 earnings per share (vs. $0.07 EPS Q1 2020). beat estimates by over 100%
* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to +50% YoY sales growth (+51% to +62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription service 

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings. 

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

  
I have been frustrated that the market was not giving this company much credit over the last 9 months. But as they keep executing quarters like this, there's no way the stock can stay down here in a single digit P/E.","self","https://redd.it/na1sv5"

With this information, we might be able to better identify if that is something we are facing at the current time and how to prepare., if that is something that is coming.

Specifically, I have a foreign issuer with an exchange traded security in their own country and a listing in the US markets as a pink sheet. The reason I'm considering both is that a pink sheet option is simpler. To buy on their own exchange, I have to incur added fees to convert into their own currency, and then higher trading fees. If I can use the pink sheet listing, then I avoid some of those costs in the process. 

The specific questions are:

1. Volume appears quite low, sometimes trading only once every few days. Is there more to understand with this? Are there possibly market makers that routinely arbitrage across geographies? If I were to place some orders, I just want to make sure it's not that much worse than going through the hassle of buying through their own exchange. This applies to the purchase, and in some years, it's also relevant on the sale.

2. How should an investor confirm that the pink sheet listing is *actually* the company they want, and not a fake or misleading listing? Foreign issuers (I've seen this a few times now) don't always list all the exchange listings on their website or in their annual report.

Earlier in the week I wrote about a hyperinflation mastersheet I was working on:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GA3bKSz5PMbZKaLKazA4dYUhDXMgN7G7lq1sIyPww9s/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GA3bKSz5PMbZKaLKazA4dYUhDXMgN7G7lq1sIyPww9s/edit?usp=sharing)

To recap, the idea is pretty straight forward. The sheet will collect data from many hyperinflations over the course of history to analyse a few things:  


*1. Is it possible this is something we are possibly facing?*

  
*2. What is the ideal form of self-defence? What also is a hiding place that traditional capital mightmiss? e.g. Foreign companies with lots of debt in USD. British American Tobacco trading at 10 times earnings with tons of dollar denominated debt- I see you bro!*

&#x200B;

The reaction to my previous post was two fold:

**1. It was a complete over-reaction.** I understand this reaction, but disagree completely. Over the past ten years, central banks have embarked on unprecedented money printing in the form of QE. What is QE anyways? QE was a phrase invented by [Richard Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Werner) an oxbridge graduate who had an idea for dealing with depressed Japanese banks in the early 90s. His thinking was: if you create money and it lend it to small businesses around the country, you can stimulate growth. Werner's explicity warned that you should *not* create currency to invest in assets, or lend exclusively to big institutions, or else you get massive asset bubbles. But this is exactly what has happened. By deviating from this playbook, central banks have been playing pumping up the markets and turning them into a massive casino. The idea of prudent central banks managing the inflation below 2% target is bogus. They basically put all their chips on red and shut their eyes from 2013 onwards. They are not even following Werner's original vision for QE.

*Many criticised the post and said they would wait unti CPI hits 5%. That is a reasonable response. But I think it misses the overall picture. The scale of the money printing is enormous, unprecedented and has historically lead to hyperinflation many times over. Whether the CPI hits 5% this month is not significant. We are going down this road whether it happens next month, or in five years time. If you look at cycles of fiat currencies throughout history, the final stretch of the cycle almost always involves excessive money printing and then hyperinflation. It is therefore far more likely than you might think.*

But what is the history of currency debasement? The Song Dynasty invented [invented fiat currency in the 1000s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) From 1000-1368, the Song and successive Yuan dynasty all dabbled in cracking out the printing press. It always ended up with hyperinflation. In 1700s, [John Law](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/John_Law_inflation_in_France) convinced the French court to try unbridled currency creation to solve all their problems. This was the first major experiement with paper money in the west. Law did not generate hyperinflation, but instead very very high inflation. He chose the path of deflation instead of printing and printing. During the French revolution sixty years later, they went full-blown John Law and got their hyperinflation. Interestingly, [they called the  printed money that was handed out ""stimulus"" back then as well.](https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/economic-ideas-inflation-price-controls-collectivism-french-revolution/)

*All of these instances look very similar to what central banks are doing today.*

The second criticism I got was:

**2 Lyn Alden, Dalio and other have already covered this.** This is a very fair point as well, but I still believe the mastersheet is justified. Lyn Alden is a widely read and respected analyst. If inflation unfortunately does ramp up, a lot of folks will be glued to that report. The point of the mastersheet however is also to identify sectors or hiding places that might not be so well-known. Hyperinflation is after all a game of capital chasing hiding places and then authorities reacting. It is a game of cat and mouse.

Another point I would add is that the focus of her work has not been on hyperinflation specifically and that is important. During hyperinflation, authorities become desperate and close down many escape routes. For example, gold was a great investment during the inflation of the 1970s and Lyn also recommends buying gold. I have found that gold is almost always banned during inflations and pretty early on as well. Another rational decision during hyperinflation would be to hide in foreign equities listed on your stock exchange. But authorities typically put in place strict capital controls to stop this happening.  Again, the hyperinflation mastersheet will allow you to assess whether that is a rational deicions.

To summarise, I have not found very many reports or analysis that focus exlusively on hyperinflation which is why I am doing this. So my pitch is this:

If you are interested in contributing to the hyperinflation mastersheet, learning about whether we might possibly be facing this and about hypothetical self-defence options, get involved.

I set up a discord for the project here if anyone is remotely interested.

If we thought we had anything interesting, we could share it with the rest of the sub

Warren and Charlie always talk about the best deals in China. Well I think I found it. The stock has gone from 2.25 to 6.50 since the beginning of 2020 and is still trading at less than cash minus liabilities.



They are a  Chinese Chemical company. They are  located in China and does all of its business in China, but their headquarters are in Nevada and is listed in the Nasdaq. 

 I like this company just because of how cheap it is. It is a “value investment” It’s currently selling at a 65 Million Market Cap. Cash Minus all liabilities alone the company is worth 78 Million. Assets minus all liabilities is worth over 250 Million. 

This company manufactures and sells Bromine and Crude Salt, they also have a chemical factory that creates many chemical products using the bromine. The company is selling for so cheap because for over the last 3 years the company has been forced to shut down all of their factories due to new environment regulations. Prior to the regulations this companies' factories were in the middle of cities and the chemicals were literally running down the street and into the city.

The last 3 years they have had to demolish some factories and move to a more secluded area and also made major upgrades to some factories that were allowed to stay in place. This has cost over 100 Million dollars so far, but the end is in sight. 

Prior to shutting down factories the company had revenues of 162 Million and 34 Million in Net Income. in 2016 they had 149 Million in Revenue and 36 Million in Net Income. If they can get back to half of these levels, then the 65 Million market cap is extremely cheap.

They have a total of 7 bromine and crude salt factories, 4 of them have been approved. Third quarter, 6/1/2020 to 9/31/2020 was first quarter in 3 years where they've had 4 factories running the entire quarter. They posted their first profits in three years in Q4 2020.

The price of Bromine in China is at an all-time High which is very good for this company. China is an importer of Bromine so it's easy for the company to find buyers. Hoping the last 3 factories will get approved soon, there's a chance they don't ever get approved but the company seems optimistic they will get approved.

They just started building the chemical factory, hoping it will be up and running early 2022. The chemical factory had the largest revenues and profit margins in 2015 for the company. The company expects the profit margins to be even better when it's finished with the upgraded facility.

In 2015 the Revenues were

Bromine- 52 Million
Crude Salt - 10 Million
Chemical Products- 99 Million

2015 Net-Income by segment 

Bromine- 11 Million
Crude Salt- 1 Million
Chemical Products- 33 Million


The company will continue to eat through cash until the chemical factory is built, I believe around 30 Million left. With 94 Million cash and only 16 Million liabilities they have plenty of cash to fund this.

My only reason for believing it's risky is the chances of it being a fraud. I think the chances are low. Their independent accountant is Morison Cogen. They are registered with the PCAOB which makes me feel decent about it not being a fraud, it is possible, but a lot of people would have to be in on it or at least ignorant to it. All of which is possible. 

My concerns with the company are again the chance of fraud. This company is very cheap however China does not allow them to repurchase shares because they don't have any operations in the USA. They issue a few shares every quarter, so I watch this to make sure they are not giving away too much of the company. They are trying to work around this. Our current relationship with china is a risk but I don't think it will have much effect long term. The fact that the company is so small and in China the stock is very volatile.

Overall, the company is selling for 65 Million and I think it's worth somewhere between 85-300 Million, depending on how profitable they can be. 

The 1Q results will be reported on Monday and I expect them to be near break even because the company was shut down for 6 weeks due to environmental regulations. But with the price of bromine so high I expect a great Q2 and Q3. The next couple years could be great.

I like this company personally but wouldn't feel that comfortable risking others in it. At one point I had 99% of my net worth in it. It's not great but it's really cheap.

Price is currently at \~6$ per share, market cap 740M. Price has been recently hit as US government contracts have not been renewed, and half of their revenues come from government contracts. There is a lot of negativity around prison stocks, and big banks have also declared they are not going to fund debt of private prisons companies.

PE=5.3, Operating Margin 10%, EV/EBITDA 9, Debt/Equity 3.9.

I am trying to value this stock. I have 3 ways to calculate intrinsic value:

IV1: FCF is \~300M in the last TTM. Revenue and CF in the last years have been really stable. Given that the operations will be cut in half (as I stated above), let's suppose they will have half of the FCF for the next years, i.e. \~150M. Considering no growth, and 10% discount rate, a simple DCF gives an intrinsic value of 1,470M, i.e. 12$/share (2 times the price it is now!).

IV2: However this does not consider debt. To consider debt I usually calculate the net debt: total liabilities less cash, which is \~3,270M. I then subtract the net debt to the calculated intrinsic value, which is 1,470M less 3,270M... which is negative! So my usual analysis tells me this company is valued less than 0! This might be too conservative maybe? I know that REIT usually have high debt (I think 3.6 on average...), and it is normal.

IV3: Third way is to calculate liquidation value. They have 3.6B of assets (total asset less goodwill) vs 3.5B of total liabilities. So asset less liabilities is  \~100M, i.e. 100M/122shares outstanding gives 0.82$/share, much less then the price now...

**Question 1: how should I value this company or REITs in general?**

Management has decided to not issue the recent dividend, to repay debt. This is a good sign and shows responsibility from the management. Since most of the investors were in for the dividend (it is a REIT...) the price has been hit after the announcement.

Before the end of the year, they need to decide if they want to keep being a REIT (which means they HAVE TO issue dividends) or not. The second option I think is better because it allows them to deleverage, and I think it is good for shareholders as well.

**Question 2: How do you think the transformation from REIT to a non-dividend paying company will be perceived by the shareholder? Will they dump the stock as when they cut the dividend last quarter? Or will it be a catalyst for a stock price jump?**","self","https://redd.it/nhns3t"

* I own shares of Support.com.
* If Support.com's share price goes up high enough, I might sell my position.

**TL;DR**: Even though Support.com (SPRT) might not have the greatest business model out there today, and even though its latest adventure into the crypto currency world is speculative, shorting the stock might be a very bad idea for many reasons, including a great team, high insider ownership, a strong balance sheet, and low liquidity.

Starting off with a brief history of Support.com might sound boring at first, but let me show you that it is quite important in this case. Support.com was founded in 1997, with one of its founders being Marc Pincus. If that name doesn't ring a bell yet, let me help you out: he's the guy that later brought us hours of joy with FarmVille, that Facebook game that got hugely successful, as he was also the founder of Zynga in 2007. Back then, one of Support.com's early investors was SoftBank, and its initial goals were quite ambitious: they wanted to create self-healing software. Please don't ask me what that is, but to me it sounds rather high-tech and artifical-intelligency. 

The first few years looked bright, at least from a valuation point of view: the company went public in 2000 at a $1.5bn valuation. Fast forward to today: the company has a market cap of roughly $60m and its ambitious initial focus have faded since. Today, the company basically offers phone support services to enterprise customers. And with customers I mean: two customers. At this point, you might say: this actually does sound like an awful company, why the heck shouldn't I short it?

Let me tell you why.

Support.com has $46m of current assets and total liabilities of $7m. If you completely disregard any value of its non-current assets (which you very well might), one could imagine that Support.com would be able liquidate its business, pay back all of its creditors, pay out the remaining cash to the shareholders and close up shop. As there are roughly 24m shares outstanding, this case would give you about $1.63 per share. The biggest fear for me would be that, for whatever reason, the company does not actually have the current assets. But I have no reason to believe that, actually, I have evidence to believe the opposite. Support.com paid a special dividend of $1.00 at the end of 2019, and I can confirm that I received that dividend. Fully paid and well on time. They actually did have the cash and distributed it nicely to their shareholders. You might be interested to hear that the share price before the special dividend was announced was at around $1.90 per share. A stock that can be bought at $1.90 paying a $1.00 (special) dividend is rather extraordinary, right? So what happened?

In 2016, Support.com reported a net loss of $27m for fiscal year 2015. They somehow managed to have that huge loss while only having revenues of $77m. At the time, the company has been living off of its cash reserves for years, burning through the money that it still had from the successful IPO many years prior. Their products were bad, their business was bad. At that time, however, a group of investors wanted to make some changes. In June 2016, they staged a coup and replaced the entire Board of Directors of the company with their own picks. They installed a new CEO, Rick Bloom, and set out to improve things. Lingering legal cases (a relic from previous management) had to be resolved, cost and profitability needed to be addressed. And they did a terrific job: Only two years later, in fiscal 2018, they were profitable. Or more accurately: they would have been if they didn't have to pay a $10m fine to resolve the legal issues they inherited from previous management.

In the years thereafter, Support.com set out to transform and improve their business, which turned out to be rather difficult. Support.com was operating on a break-even level, but had a tough time growing and getting more profitable. The company tried to gain new customers, as almost all of its revenues came from two customers only, and one of those customers was winding down their business with Support.com steadily. Revenues went down from $77m in 2015 to $44m in 2020. It looks like Support.com was mostly getting rid of unprofitable business, as their margins have been steadily increasing (their gross profit was higher in 2020 than in 2015!), but they did not seem to get new profitable business. I think it is for that reason that last year, the company decided to hire a new CEO. Often in these cases, the old CEO is fired, but not in our case. The old CEO (Rick Bloom) was not ousted - he still remains one of the largest shareholders of Support.com and sits on its Board of Directors. It much rather seems to me that Mr. Bloom decided that he wasn't the right guy to do this job any more - he was great in bringing the cost down, but he did not quite succeed in transforming the business and bringing in new revenue, so he decided to look for a better man (or woman!) for the job. And, oh boy, what a better (in this case) man for the job he found.

The new guy's name is Lance Rosenzweig, and he is a outsourcing and support industry veteran. Lance himself founded a different support company in 1998, namely PeopleSupport Inc. As a CEO and founder, he grew the company to $150m dollars in revenue, brought it public, got it to a market cap of more than $500m and then successfully sold it to a competitor. After he sold his company, he stayed in the outsourcing industry and was, among others, the CEO of an outsourcing company named Startek, where he grew revenues to $650m and dramatically grew EBITDA.

My first thought, when Lance took over in 2020 was: Why would an accomplished entrepreneur and manager, who managed companies ten times its size, come and be the CEO of this small and seemingly declining company? It certainly wasn't just for the money. He was already a wealthy man, having made millions with PeopleSupport and at his previous positions. At Support.com, he got a yearly salary of $480'000: not bad, but also not actually astronomical for a CEO of a public company. He got a nice options package, though, in case he managed to increase shareholder value. My best guess, why Lance took over the job is this: He was bored, liked the challenge, and saw lots of potential. Soon after he took over, he hit the ground running and put together his ""dream team"": He hired a new Chief Financial Officer, a new Chief Operating Officer, a new Chief Information Officer, and a new Chief Legal Officer. What really caught my eye was the fact that Lance worked with almost all of them at previous companies already.

So here we have an extraordinarily well fitting manager who has proven his skills in the past for way larger companies in exactly the same industry, and he decides to work for this small, rather obscure, seemingly declining company for (relatively) little pay. Additionally, he convinces his previous colleagues to quit their jobs and work with him on this project instead. For me, this shows that he sees potential in Support.com, and he had no bad feelings about asking his previous team to work with him again - and all of them (all industry veterans as well!) agreed!

From all of the above, I see Support.com rather as a startup, than an old, obsolete company. It has put together an all-star team, it has a huge amount of cash, and it even has revenues and is basically break-even at this point. For a startup like this, professional investors are often pay way more than what this company is currently selling for. With its strong balance sheet, the share even has a theoretical bottom at $1.63. Generally, at the current share price, one gets a lot of upside and only a little bit of downside.

But that's not all!

If you take a look at Support.com's price chart, you will see that something big happened on March 21 of this year. The price went from $2.14 from the previous close to a high of $9.45. It more than quadrupled. The volume was also incredibly high: While in the previous days, usually less then 100'000 shares were traded on a given day, on March 21 the volume was over 280m shares traded. For reference: Support.com only has 24m shares outstanding.

So what happened on March 21st? Basically, there was a merger announcement: Greenidge Generation Holdings, Inc., a New York based Bitcoin mining company that owns its own natural gas powered power plant and Support.com announced a plan that the two companies would like to merge. The market went crazy over those news and pushed the share price of Support.com to new highs. The general details of the deal are, that the shareholders of Support.com will own about 7.7% of the resulting, merged company. So the current Support.com and Greenidge Generation Holdings would put each of their business into a new company, and the current shareholders of Support.com would own 7.7% of this new business. The exact numbers will only be calculated at the time when (and if) the merger is actually happening, but roughly speaking, if you hold one share of Support.com now, you will get 0.124 shares of the new company, whose ticker symbol is going to be GREE, and you won't own any Support.com shares any longer. I have seen some people being confused about this, so I would like to make one point clear: after the merger, there will be no more Support.com shares, only Greenidge shares. So if you own let's say 800 shares of Support.com today, you will, after the merger, have about 99 (800 x 0.124) shares of Greenidge. Mathematically speaking, the share price of the new company (GREE) should be roughly eight times higher then the share price of Support.com at the closing of the merger, so you don't gain or lose any money just because of the merger closing. Of course the share prices can move, and the markets can behave irrationally, but generally speaking, this should be expected. So if you own 800 shares of Support.com and their price is let's say at $5.00 before the merger happening, that package is worth $4'000. After the merger, you will have 99 shares of Greenidge, and their price should be roughly $40.32 each, so you would still have $4'000. By the way - none of this post is financial advice, I just want to warn people that shorting Support.com might be dangerous.

Regarding the merger deal, I am not quite sure what to think. I have no opinion on Bitcoin mining or crypto currencies, and I don't know what the future will hold for that industry. In the merger presentation, however, Greenidge kind of implied that they are better and cooler than two of its main competitors, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). Greenidge also already has submitted a so called [Form S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844971/000119312521149057/d166032ds4.htm) to the SEC, in which one can look up how the merger proposal came to be. It's a very interesting read, I can recommend it! In the merger negotiations between Support.com and Greenidge, there are also mentions of RIOT and MARA, and Greenidge (and some financial advisors) used those two companies to come up with a valuation for Greenidge as well. The market cap of RIOT today is $2.3bn, the market cap of MARA is $2.5bn. If we assume that Greenidge's value is also in that ballpark (I understand that some people might say that Greenidge is worth less, others might argue that Greenidge is worth more), let's say $2.4bn, and we just take Support.com's current market value, which is about $70m, then the combined company should be worth roughly $2.5bn. The new company will have about 39m shares, so the expected share price for the new company at that valuation would be $64.14. Based on that value, the fair price of Support.com should be $7.95 ($64.14 * 0.124). Today, it is at $2.85. I think it is rather undervalued.

Of course, one can argue about many of my assumptions and arguments, but I generally come to the conclusion that there is limited downside for Support.com's stock, but a pretty nice upside, and shorting the stock now might be very dangerous. Actually, there are four more points that make shorting Support.com even more risky:

1. Downward pressure on the price is limited. There are hardly any stocks to short out there anyhow, and I can't imagine where any more downward pressure on the price might come from. If you check out the [shares available for shorting](https://www.shortablestocks.com/?sprt), you'll see that one currently can only short about 100'000 shares. In the past couple of days, that number was even lower and at times there were no shares to short at all. This kind of implies, that everyone, who could short, has shorted already, so if you're holding a short position, you can't expect further downward pressure on the stock's price from additional shorters, because there are just no more shares to short. On the contrary: the people, who currently hold the shares of Support.com, have either bought them recently at rather low prices below $3.00, or have been holding for quite a long time (like me). They have gone through the price decline from $9.45 at the time of the merger announcement to $5.00, to $4.00, to $3.00, to $2.84 now. If they didn't sell at $5.00, or at $3.00 - why would they sell now at even lower prices? Especially if they might have the same thoughts that I lined out above.

2. The merger is not done yet, and the terms of the deal might even improve for Support.com shareholders. Support.com's shareholders still have to vote on the merger, basically saying whether or not they want the deal to happen or not. At some point (soon), a special meeting will be held at Support.com and the shareholders will have to vote for or against the merger. The merger can only happen when a majority of the shareholders approve the merger. This situation, that the special meeting has not been held yet, has two advantages from my point of view: First, Support.com's shareholders are protected against crazy downward movements or legal actions until the vote is done. What I mean is: if Bitcoin's price fell to 0 tomorrow, and Bitcoin mining would be rather useless as a result, and Greenidge's value would be zero, then Support.com's shareholders could still vote against the deal and continue as before. The same goes for a situation where the state of New York or the U.S. government bans Bitcoin mining and problems like that. But for all I know, Bitcoin's price could go to $1m, and I also kind of doubt that Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin are banned any time soon... Basically, all I see again is: limited downside, big upside. Actually, one more thing to consider regarding the merger is this: The terms of the deal have been negotiated back in January, February, and March of this year. Support.com and Greenidge agreed on the proposed terms on March 19th. On that date, RIOT's share price was at $60, MARA's share price was at $43. Now they are at $28 and $26, respectively. Now this might be wishful thinking, and is rather speculative, but I think there is a good chance that Greenidge might improve their offer to Support.com's shareholders. As I see it, Greenidge wants to become a public company. They have put in a lot of time and effort of making that happen - and the current market is, albeit a bit less favorable as in March of this year, still pretty nice for a public listing. So it's in their interest to make the merger happen - and for that, they might need to convince Support.com's shareholders, that the merger is a good deal for them. However, the deal's terms were negotiated in March, when the other crypto mining's companies shares were trading at double the price of today - Support.com's shareholders might have a problem with that. Greenidge could easily counter this by improving their offer, for instance by giving Support.com's shareholders a bigger piece of the merged company, for instance.
 
3. Liquidity is very low. In the last couple of days, the daily volume for Support.com's shares was around 500'000 shares a day. That's a dollar volume of less than $1'500'000. And not just that - it does not take much to make the price move. Just yesterday, for instance, it looks like there was a buyer for 100'000 shares at around 3:20 pm (NY time) and that moved the price $2.68 to $2.88. So with only $280'000, the price increased by more than 7%. I think this is a result of very few people selling, many people holding, and a huge insider ownership that is also holding. I don't want to imagine what happens to people who have a short position in this stock when suddenly good news and bigger volume comes in. I kind of think that a perfect storm might be forming here.

4. Insider ownership is huge, float is small, and short interest is very high. If you make a stock screener on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/new), and filter for stocks that are in the United States, have a short percentage of float of larger than 33%, insider holding percentage of larger than 25%, and institutional holding percentage of larger than 50%, only two stocks (of 17'252 securities in the US, according to yahoo finance) come up. One of them is Support.com. Insiders are holding a large position, and they have been holding it for a long time. Take Rick Bloom, the former CEO, now a Director, for instance: he owns more than 1.3 million shares. Interesting tidbit: He bought more than 700'000 shares in the open market back in 2019 after the special dividend was announced with his own money. A big bulk of his holding is not from receiving shares as a CEO and a Director for free, but he put his money where his mouth was. Bradley Radoff, another director of the company, holds more than 1.7m shares. They have not sold a single share since the announcement of the merger proposal - they would have had to report any activity like that on a Form 4 at the SEC. I have seen some people suggest that Support.com was a pump-and-dump scheme back in March. I can't agree with that. First of all, there was no real ""pump"", they just announced the merger agreement, which they are legally required to do. And all the holders of the company are still holding all of their shares, so no dumping, either.

Maybe, as a last point: Support.com was not very, let's say ""active"" with their communications towards investors. There were no conference calls to discuss the quarterly earnings, hardly any interview, no investor presentations... They focused on turning the company around and getting the operation in shape, and I think they have done a terrific job. If you now consider that it's in both of the companies interest to ramp that activity up, and usually that is the case around an IPO (or in this case a listing through a merger), and if you combine that with all of my points from above, I think a perfect storm might be brewing here. And I think that shorting Support.com's stock now might be a very bad idea.","self","https://redd.it/nm5h0l"

En-Japan (4849 JP) is a Japanese online recruitment company.

* It owns a large and growing platform for job advertisements, with a user-generated company review system that is the strongest in Japan by a factor of 10x. What makes the company stand out is its Amazon-like focus on doing what’s right for the user - seeking long-term satisfaction not just for their corporate clients but also for job seekers.
* The take-rate for Japanese recruitment companies tends to be high (up to 1/3 of a yearly salary). On the other hand, the average Japanese switches jobs only 1/10 as often as the average American. This disparity will probably narrow over time. Also, En-Japan’s user base is comprised of young professionals. The company will most likely be able to grow with its users as they age and achieve higher income.
* I believe that En-Japan’s new Engage platform is a stroke of genius. Similar to what Shopify has managed to achieve in e-commerce, Engage enables En-Japan to “sit on the client” and dominate the market in an era of distributed job boards.
* The Japanese job market was hurt by COVID-19 but has now started to recover. Japan’s ongoing vaccination program will accelerate this process. Full inoculation of the population is expected in early 2022. Management commentary is becoming increasingly positive. And there are clear precedents: job markets in the US and Australia now actually have more overall job postings than before the pandemic.
* Underlying growth in the domestic job board segment, recovery from COVID-19 and monetisation of the Engage platform is likely to bring operating profit close to JPY 20 billion by FY2025, implying an upside of +68% against assumed EV/EBIT of 12x.

Including a basic back of the envelope take at the possible math. Haven't included a div recap which will goose up the IRR. If this is anywhere close to reality then these are very aggressive assumptions - very high entry multiple and very high leverage!

After reading the press release on Medline website it seems to me that Medline may be retaining a much larger equity stake since the Mills are retaining full control from an economics and management standpoint. If so that can bring down the leverage considerably. This is not a traditional LBO as the news headlines are making it out to be.

Think the pf ownership structure could look something like this:

Mills 34%, BX, CG, HF 20% each, GIC 6%

As I get ready for the role, I'm hoping to train my investor mindset a bit more. With this in mind, I wanted to see if this community had suggestions for news sources and investors to follow to get a good grasp on trends and investment ideas in this space.

However, they obviously span the entire range of investment opportunities (from airlines to cybersecurity to oil and gas).

***Business Overview***

Bayer is a life science company that operates through three channels. Pharma, Crop Science and Consumer Health.

Pharma generates 43% of revenues. Bayer’s pharma operations specialize in cardiovascular and cell and gene therapy, and oncology sectors. Pharma’s revenues are majorly derived from Xarelto, Eylea, and Mirena/Kyleena/Jaydess blockbuster drugs contributing 8.1 billion EUR of Pharma’s total sales of 14.1 billion EUR. In addition, Bayer has invested in cell & gene therapy and oncology markets to prepare upcoming products. Bayer’s next blockbusters are expected to be Nubeqa, Finerenone, and Elinzanetant, operating in oncology, cardiovascular, and women’s health markets.

Crop Science contributes 50% of revenues. However, in 2020 crop science was a drag on Bayer because of lower-than-expected sales, losses from currency fluctuations and glyphosate litigation resulting from the acquisition of Monsanto.

Consumer Health (CH) generates 13% of revenues. In 2020 CH grew by 5.2% through effectively leveraging e-commerce. In addition, CH improved incremental EBITDA margins from 21% to 22% through finding product cost efficiencies and digitizing its supply chain.

Through 2020 Bayer’s share price has had significant volatility; however, it has ended down \~5% even with most of the glyphosate litigation behind the firm and robust growth in the core business through the pandemic. Bayer’s dividend yield is 3.7%; this should increase modestly as Bayer’s management has committed to paying 30-40% of operating cashflows out as dividends.

***Thesis***

There are two types of company’s worthy of an investment.

1. Companies that are undervalued because they compound at a high rate and become increasingly valuable.
2. Companies that are cheap enough where you are almost guaranteed to make a profit. Enjoy the last puff.

Bayer has the potential to become a compounder; it benefits from multiple tailwinds, exhibits economies of scale and scope and has challenging to replicate expertise in developing complex products in two core verticals, Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals. Bayer’s Consumer Health segment is a strong cashflow generator that can grow by expanding in emerging markets; high cashflow generation allow this segment to take additional leverage lowering Bayer’s cost of capital.

Right now, I would recommend an investment in Bayer now because it is cheap. Investor sentiment is at an all-time low providing an opportunity to invest in a leading health science company at rock bottom prices. Please see the assumptions tab in the attached excel file for my revenue growth expectations, and please see the DCF tab, which shows the impact of assumptions on valuation.

Catalysts for Bayer re-rating towards Comps include.

1. Concluding glyphosate litigation
2. Crop Science division's rollout of fourth generation soybean traits.
3. Commercialization of late-stage pipeline drugs Nubeqa, Finerenone, and Elinzanetant - Projection for Finerenone dived into in internal analysis

***Company Industries Overview***

Bayer operates in three different industries; its largest revenue source is the Global Fertilizers and Agrochemicals (GFA) market, followed by Pharma and Consumer Health.

*Crop Science*

The GFA market has undergone significant consolidation. Major events include Bayer acquiring Monsanto (the previously largest player in the GFA market) and the merger of Dow and Dupont, creating Corteva. GFA market is a \~$100 billion opportunity broken down into two groups Crop Protection (CP) 60% and Seeds 40%. The GFA market is critical to sustaining and growing global populations. Bayer has a strong position in both markets, with 21% and 25% market share in CP and Seeds, respectively.

The GFA market is driven by global population, available agricultural land, average crop prices, and price of inputs (natural gas and oil). As inputs to this industry are commodities, there is limited power of suppliers.

GFA producers benefit from two secular tailwinds world population rising and agricultural land decreasing. First, the global population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. Second, climate change is expected to decrease harvest yields and arable farmland in developing and low-income countries. In contrast, developed countries can convert forests to agricultural land to increase available farmland; however, developed countries cannot continue this practice indefinitely. These two secular tailwinds ensure that the GFA market grows at 2-3% annually.

The GFA market enjoys high margins, with major players enjoying EBITDA margins in the high-tens to mid-twenties. High margins are achieved because customers are highly diversified, and there are no substitutes for CP or Seeds. High R&D needed to compete in the GFA market creates high barriers to entry. This market structure enhances the need for economies of scale to spread R&D and other expenses over a large customer base; an oligopolistic market structure is seen as five leading players in the space acquire and merge to create ever-larger firms.

*Pharma*

Bayer competes in the global pharmaceuticals & medicine manufacturing market (GPMM.). The GPMM is a $1.3 trillion opportunity. The GPMM is highly fragmented, with players carving out niches in the space. This industry’s key external drivers are an ageing population, per capita healthcare spend of OECD countries, technological change, and global per capita income.

The GPMM benefits from two tailwinds: developing countries increase in wealth, and western populations continue to age. As Western populations age, spending on healthcare by OECD countries will continue to rise to meet population needs and significant increases in global per capita income increase the demand for medical products. Both tailwinds should allow the industry to grow faster than global average inflation.

Because of the extensive R&D needed to develop products, average EBITDA margins are north of 25%. High margins reflect limited supplier and buyer power. As base chemicals are the raw supplies for industry products, there is little supplier power; however, for firms that purchase patents, there is high supplier power as patents are unique and are sold to the highest bidder. In addition, products in their exclusivity period give the patent owner ultimate pricing power as there are no substitutes. However, substitutes become readily available once drugs lose exclusivity as generic versions are available at lower prices.

Bayer and most competitors meet these KSF’s; however, Bayer stands out as it has a robust biologics portfolio, limiting generic competition as generic bio-similar drugs are more difficult to develop.

*Consumer Health*

The consumer health (CH) segment is very similar to the Pharma segment. CH operates in a highly fragmented market, with an ageing populating and increases in per-capita incomes driving segment demand. Producers either manufacture CH products in-house through purchasing raw materials as commodities, leading to low supplier power or may outsource production leading to a higher power of suppliers. Buyers have significant power in this market as supermarkets and pharmacies usually carry these products and make them available over the counter, making it of paramount importance to have good buyer relationships. The threat of substitutes is also high as most CH products have significant direct and indirect competition, direct from generic’s, indirect from products with a similar outcome. The threat of new entry is low as there are significant R&D barriers to creating new CH drugs which can receive exclusivity and significant financial barriers to entry for generics that require investments in fixed assets to manufacture products.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused consumers to place increased emphasis on their health. As a result, health-related spending has increased by over 5% in 2020 vs 2019. Additionally, with consumers spending more time at home, they increase acceptance of personalized nutrition and increase purchases of healthcare items through e-commerce channels.

***Internal Analysis***

*Crop Science*

Bayer is an established leader in crop science, having a dominant position in CP and Seeds, ranking #1 in market position in three segments and 2nd and 3rd in the final three segments. Bayer’s revenues are well diversified, with seeds, herbicides and fungicides comprising 27%, 25% and 14% of sales. Comparing Bayer’s sales mix to the global agricultural input market (27% Bayer vs 15% global ag market), it becomes evident that Bayer is excessively reliant on its seeds segment. Bayer has significant revenues from the Seeds segment because Bayer acquired Monsanto, an industry leader in genetically modified seeds. Another remnant of Monsanto is a strong North American presence. As a result, 44% of Bayer’s crop science revenues come from North America, making up 24% of the global ag input market.

The main competitors in the agricultural technologies space are Corteva, Syngenta and BASF. Bayer has higher sales than all competitors in both CP and Seeds, allowing Bayer to exercise economies of scale, reducing its costs seen by its \~24% EBITDA margin vs comps, which average \~18%. Greater sales and margins allow Bayer to have a sustained competitive advantage through R&D economies of scale, having over 2 billion EUR in R&D spend comprising \~ 10% of sales vs comps which spend anywhere from 400 million to 1.5 billion EUR on R&D.

Bayer’s higher R&D spend created a robust pipeline with key new products being introduced in all three critical areas of CP (herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides), which are expected to grow crop science revenues by north of 4% annually. In addition, new product launches focusing on emerging markets have the potential to reduce Bayer’s reliance on the North American market.

Risks to the crop science division include

·       Higher losses from glyphosate litigation

·       Consumer’s voting with dollars to reduce GMOs in foods

·       Volatility in commodity markets reducing demand and margins on products

·       North American “Next-Gen” corn and soybean upgrades receive poor reception

The crop science division faces risks; however, Bayer has adequately prepared for these risks. Bayer has set aside over 13 billion EUR in reserves for litigation which is wrapping up. Well-off consumers in western countries may use dollars to vote against GMO crops; however, less well-off consumers worldwide and especially in developing countries will see significant benefits from using GMO products. Although a flawed rollout of next­-gen seeds would increase demand for current-gen products, over time, I believe that farmers will choose to use next-gen products as they increase harvest potential and profits through lower maintenance and faster/more efficient growth.

*Pharma*

Bayer’s Pharma segment is a leader in the following therapeutic areas with revenue breakdown

·       Cardiovascular – 37%

·       Hematology – 5%

·       Women’s health – 16%

·       Radiology – 9%

·       Oncology – 9%

·       Ophthalmology – 14%

Most of Bayer’s Pharma division is highly diversified in terms of available products; however, most pharma sales come from five products, comprising 9.6 billion EUR of 14.1 billion EUR in total sales.

Xarelto is the largest revenue driver for Pharma, with 4.5 billion EUR in sales. However, Xarelto’s forthcoming loss of exclusivity without another massive blockbuster coming out has reduced analyst’s expectations of Pharma’s revenues in the future. Xarelto lost exclusivity in China in 2020 and will lose exclusivity in key markets from 2022-2025, with significant revenue geographies losing exclusivity in 2024. Bayer expects to make up for Xarelto’s lost revenues by introducing three new products that it estimates will generate revenues of over 1 billion EUR each. Nubeqa, Finerenone, and Elinzanetant are the anticipated blockbusters. All three operate in different rapidly growing markets. Bayer maintains a strong product pipeline investing in oncology which analysts and the company believe will be a growth platform for the firm in the next three years. Additionally, through completing a series of acquisitions, Bayer has bought capabilities in the cell and gene therapy market expected to generate products post-2025 and signed 25 business development contracts expected to grow Bayer’s pharma pipeline.

Finerenone is particularly promising. Finerenone isn’t a general inhibitor and is better at targeting the MR receptor in kidneys than diabetes treatments such as Metformin, the current industry leader. As a result, Finerenone goes beyond the capabilities of Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors or Biguanides (Metformin is Biguanide), which manages type two diabetes but does not prevent chronic kidney disease (CKD) Finerenone is the only drug that prevents CKD.

Finerenone is a big deal because, in America alone, 12.5 million are at risk of CKD. The number is anticipated to continue rising, with obesity a pre-cursor for type two diabetes on the rise. Harvard research shows that the USA has a 34% obesity rate, which they expect to reach 50% by 2050. Age is another risk factor, with developed economies experiencing a demographic shift towards older populations provides another tailwind for Finerenone sales.

Current products meant to manage type 2 diabetes must be taken three times a day, with each pill costing from 41-71 cents. Finerenone is anticipated to cost north of one dollar per pill and can be taken twice a day. My analysis concludes to reach one billion in sales, Finerenone only needs to capture 5% of the American market. Without including revenues from the rest of the world, we can comfortably say that Bayer is understating the size of this opportunity.

*Consumer Health*

Bayer’s Consumer Health (CH) segment provides products, services, and information to improve their health. Bayer is the #3 OTC player globally, with leading positions in seven of the top ten OTC markets. In addition, CH focuses on non-prescription products in the following markets.

·       Allergy, Cough & Cold

·       Nutritional’s

·       Dermatology

·       Pain & Cardio

Some marquee products include Aspirin, Claritin and Aleve. These and other OTC products generate \~5 billion EUR in revenues. CH has achieved a growth rate CAGR of \~2% over the past five years; however, CH has grown at 5.2% in the past year and achieved EBITDA margin expansion from 20.1% in 2018 to 22% in 2020. CH plans to continue its focus on preventative care and expand its sales and product lines globally by more effectively leveraging e-commerce and marketing its products. Geographically Bayer is investing in developing a stronger brand presence in the USA, India, China and South-East Asia. By expanding in these geographies, Bayer can tap a lucrative market the is rapidly growing. The CH segment also cuts costs by achieving production cost efficiencies, implementing cost-cutting programs at facilities, and limiting investments into Capex, opting for a more variable cost structure.

***Financials***

Bayer has a strong balance sheet with \~55% of capital provided by debt. Bayer intends to pay down their debt; however, under my assumptions, this is improbable unless Bayer cuts their dividend. Bayer maintaining more debt on their balance sheet is a positive for equity investors; Bayer’s pre-tax average cost of debt is \~3.45%, and Bayer recently rolled debt at lower rates. Bayer benefits from global reach, allowing access to markets where credit is cheaper – mainly Europe. With Bayer’s cost of debt low, low exit risk, and revenue visibility into the following three years, why would equity investors want to reduce the use of debt?

Over the past five years, excluding the pandemic, Bayer has grown its revenues rapidly, increasing by 5% in 2018 and 19% in 2019. Growth has mainly come from Crop Science as post-acquisition of Monsanto; Bayer received a solid portfolio of seeds and CP products from which it could develop. As a result, Bayer has maintained a 63% groupwide gross profit margin over the past few years, down from 68% it maintained during 2016 & 2017, caused by CH, which was a drag on margins over the past two years.

Since 2018 even with rising sales, Bayer has failed to earn their cost of capital. Bayer’s cost of capital is 6.8%, earning a ROCE of 3.8%, 5.0% and -39.8% in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Bayer is on track to earn its cost of capital in the future due to significant cost savings measures and finishing up a restructuring program increasing net income.

My model using below consensus revenue growth for all segments shows that Bayer is undervalued. Bayer will benefit from multiple secular tailwinds and is well-positioned to grow in the crop science and consumer health markets. However, I believe that Bayer’s Pharma segment will represent a drag on revenues resulting in a five-year revenue CAGR of 1.36%. In my base case, EBIT margins slightly shrink from 2020-2027; Bayer cuts back on Capex while annual depreciation and amortization hover around 5% of gross property plant and equipment. I have used a 1.5% terminal growth rate when valuing the firm using Gordon growth and a 10x EBITDA exit multiple under the multiples method. I wanted to be very conservative with my financials for two reasons; first, Bayer is out of my comfort zone; second, Bayer has a history of disappointing expectations set at capital markets days. The result of my valuation revealed that Bayer is undervalued by \~17% as of May 10, 2021. I believe that the fair value for Bayer is around 63 euros per share.

**Fertilizer Operations Forecast**

The fertilizer forecast assumes actual pricing up to current (most of Q2) and the remainder of the year uses pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer.html). The average gate price for the year is $295/t (remember, Midwest sells at a premium to NOLA). If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, I’ve assumed 95% utilization for the rest of 2021, current commodity prices support 2021 EBITDA of $294 MM. Using a historical multiple of 8.0x EV / EBITDA implies an EV of $2,348 MM. [Figure 2: Fertilizer Operations EV](https://imgur.com/Ts1BXeO)
 
I’ve provided a sensitivity table at the end so that you can change the assumptions and come up with your own view on value.

**Debt Refinancing (9.25% Callable Notes)**

On June 8, CVRP announced a partial redemption for its $645MM 9.25% senior secured notes due 2023. The company intends to call $550MM of these notes leaving a $95MM stub outstanding. As expected, CVRP will use the proceeds from the 45Q monetization to pay off the remaining $95MM of the 2023 notes once that transaction is complete. [Moody’s Rating Action](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-B2-to-CVR-Partners-proposed-new-notes--PR_448068) note confirms this (You don’t need to register. Just scroll and hit “I agree”). At the same time, the company placed $550MM of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This is a fantastic rate to issue 7-year notes. In addition to reducing interest expense, these notes will secure the company’s financing needs for the foreseeable future. The result of this first step, prior to monetizing the 45Q’s, is an annual interest savings of $17MM per year. That’s an additional annual distribution of $1.62 per unit.
 
**45Q Monetization (Current Legislation)**

The company is still working on monetizing the 45Q credits. The $95MM 9.25% stub gives a good indication of where management feels the 45Q valuation floor is. My calculation has the value at $113MM for the ’21-’25 credits. I tested the value for a range of discount rates and found the escalating nature of the credits on a $/t basis reduces the sensitivity of the PV to various discount rates. For comparison’s sake, I have the ’21-’25 credits valued at $104-$124MM using 5% to 15% respectively. What will management do with the remaining proceeds? There are a number of one-off expenses they could use the funds for such as underwriting/transaction fees for the debt/45Qs, the second $10MM buyback announced, or the $4-$6MM growth capex in 2021 (see slide 14 of [latest presentation](https://investors.cvrpartners.com/static-files/c7a845cb-e529-434f-8f65-947db812a55e)). In a worst case they can reserve the funds for the one-off costs. Alternatively, they may pay it out as distributions. Regardless of that decision, taking out the stub reduces the interest expense by an additional $8.8MM. That’s cash that can go straight to unit holders in the form of an additional $0.83 distribution per year. When you add this to the annual interest savings from the debt refinance, the result is $2.45/unit of perpetual distributions that are uncorrelated with operations and commodity prices. [Figure 3: 45Q Monetization Value](https://imgur.com/hbtyLKK) 
 
**Proposed 45Q Amendment**

No major updates here. After the initial [bipartisan bill](https://carboncapturecoalition.org/carbon-capture-coalition-applauds-introduction-of-bipartisan-senate-carbon-capture-utilization-and-storage-tax-credit-amendments-act/) proposed on March 25, 2021, there have been a number of proposals and discussions on these – some positive, some negative. The fact that both political parties have incentives to continue with the 45Q credits is positive, but it’s too early to say with certainty what the 45Q regime will evolve to. I’ve included the breakdown of the proposal so that you can run your own calculations if changes are announced. [Figure 4: Proposed 45Q Amendment Value](https://imgur.com/TFhkvpw)
 
**Industry Outlook**

I’ve developed a practical understanding of the industry drivers over time but I am far from an expert. For those interested, it would be more efficient to check out CF Industries’ materials such as their presentation at Stifel’s [2021 Virtual Cross Sector Insight Conference](https://wsw.com/webcast/stifel47/cf/1723170). They’ve got a good pulse on the industry and outlook for N fertilizers. This is a quote from the Stifel conference that I believe sums up the situation:
>	
>	“…we have tightness and an imbalance in the fertilizer market, you're seeing the same thing in the grains. So whether it be corn, soybean, cotton, whatever, you have very tight stocks to use. And you'll hear us talk about we believe this is a multiyear cycle because given that it's all grains, you're not really going to see the makeup of the stocks to use that are very low right now and all those particular crops over one cycle period.
>	So where we're seeing tightness in fertilizer, you're similarly seeing that same tightness in grains. And you have this dual imbalance that's going on right now that I would say that is a bit of a surprise from the standpoint that it's probably going to take multi -- growing cycles in order for us to get through that”

**Why is UAN Still Trading For $65?**

To answer that question, you need to understand how the units went from a split-adjusted $300 per unit in 2012 to $6 per unit in 2020. An MLP’s appeal is its ability to pay a tax advantaged, stable, and high yield. These units are marketed towards yield oriented retail investors. CVRP has paid declining and inconsistent distributions since 2012. Add to that a poorly timed acquisition of Rentech in 2016 which added leverage to the balance sheet. By 2020 the company was an over leveraged micro-cap MLP that paid no distributions and appeared to be at risk of going bankrupt. If that’s not appealing enough, let’s not forget it’s effectively controlled by Carl Icahn. After the first write-up I received dozens of DMs from people with cost basis up to $270. They absolutely *hate* CVRP and their management. As soon as their investment gets back to breakeven, they all sell.

All the factors that worked against CVRP units the last 6-8 years are going to be fuel for the rise. The refinancing has put the final nail in the coffin of any lingering bankruptcy fears. Now they’re on the cusp of bringing back the core unit holder base – yield oriented retail investors. To illustrate this, I’ve put together LTM metrics from Q4/20A to Q1/22E. CVRP may not be appealing to income oriented investors now, but what about when it yields 10%? 20%? 30%? At the current price, that’s the level of distributions we’re heading towards.
 [Figure 5: Forecast LTM Metrics](https://imgur.com/yFN0neY)
 
What unit price does this imply for the yield-oriented investor? Well, that depends how much appetite there is for those distributions. I would argue that in a world where a single B creditor can issue 7-year notes for 6.125%, a 10% yield should be more than enough. [Figure 6: Implied Unit Price @ Various Yields](https://imgur.com/ouG0cHe)

There is also a sell-side component that I want to address. There has been a step-change in the market and sell-side analysts are completely asleep at the wheel. I’ve compiled the fertilizer price forecasts of several equity research teams and compared it with futures and actual prices. [Figure 7: Sell Side Price Decks](https://imgur.com/OW3AveS). Let’s ignore the fact that some of these forecasts have Tampa NH3 at 2.5x UAN which makes no sense – the cost to upgrade to UAN isn’t economic at those prices so every producer would sell NH3 instead of upgrading to UAN. It's also noteworthy that they are forecasting fall fill prices (2nd highest seasonal demand period) to decline from summer. I’ll put money on that not happening, but I digress. Not surprisingly, the further out you get, the less accurate the futures and forecasts will be. But you can see that even for Q2 and Q3, there is a sizeable delta despite Q2 prices being known and a lot of information on Q3 fill programs (Hint: It’s very tight). This delta can’t continue. I expect that we’re going to see a material revision to street price decks and corresponding earnings estimates in the next couple months. 
 
**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

**Conclusion**

The first article I wrote didn't put a lot of emphasis on the fertilizer business because the other value drivers were so significant compared to the unit price at the time. Those value drivers are beginning to materialize and the focus is shifting to the underlying business. The fundamentals of that business have unfolded far better than I ever imagined it would in January. It's clear that this is not a blip but a multi-year trend. All that's left to do is collect those fat distributions while you wait a few quarters for the units to reprice to a market yield.

But that does lend itself to looking at sectors and I like to look at values while doing that. I noticed today that homebuilders seem surprisingly well positioned after a decent pullback from an earlier upward run.

**Quick Valuation**

You can look at the sector [here courtesy of Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_residentialconstruction&o=-marketcap)

* Average P/E ratio of the top 20 largest builders is just below 12. That's absurdly low in today's expensive markets. By itself however, P/E is not a good thing to look at, but other metrics also support the strong valuations.
* Accounting for past growth, the PEG ratio is also absurdly low, at 1.4
* Debt for these companies is all relatively low. Balance sheets seem in good shape for the most part (but varies company to company)

**The Macro Environment**

* Homebuilders tend to perform best when inflation growth is slowing, but overall growth is still strong.
   * That's right where we are at right now, and we are pivoting from reflation into more of the goldilocks environment where inflation is falling off a peak, and will be mean reverting for the next 1-2 quarters. I tend to think that some of the recent consolidation is partially a product of fears of margins getting cut into due to rising input costs (lumber, construction materials, labor, etc)
* Obviously, demand is quite strong and supply is super limited in homes right now as most people are already aware. This will eventually work its way out, but part of the solution is literally building more homes. I honestly would have thought that these companies would have been priced higher given how well-known the housing shortage is.
* Millenials moving to homes & starting families is a secular trend that will likely be a component of the next 5-10 years. Maybe not an immediate catalyst, but should be good as a sector tailwind for quite some time.
* The items that are causing a lot of the inflation right now are a product of supply shocks caused by Covid lockdowns. These items such as lumber will not stay high since lumber mills and timber companies have every incentive in the world to ramp up production given the high prices they can get from selling their goods. Same is true for most other sectors.
* Zooming out over a long time frame, please look at the chart of [New Privately-Owned Housing Units Started](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST) from the Federal Reserve. Note how low this has been over the last 10 years, and the fact that we're only now back at where we were in 1998. In short, we've been seeing a significant buildup of housing shortages over the last 10 years, and are only now getting back to producing in any meaningful way. So long as we have a shortage, prices will be high, and so long as prices are high, margins will be great for homebuilders and they will be encouraged to keep building. 

**Mispricing Cyclical Risk?**

While there is never any way to prove these things, I tend to believe that the consensus view on homebuilders right now is that they're priced as if the cycle will turn for them. After all, cyclicals are usually the most expensive when their P/E ratios are cheap.

Inflation ***has*** surged over the last year, and home prices have gotten quite expensive. Higher prices have led to a relative softening of demand, although nothing outrageous. Furthermore, the stock price on homebuilders has already surged since the Covid bottom.

That being said, I don't think think the rise is over yet. Thing is, mortgage rates have not meaningfully risen, and even been falling in the last few months - [see chart here](https://www.macrotrends.net/2604/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart). And I think the inflation view is going to lose steam in the next 3-4 months, which will act as a tailwind for homebuying until it starts to kick back in.

Also, while stimulus isn't going to be reaching consumers going forward, we should see that offset by a reduction in supply chain associated inflation costs.

In short, I think that the cyclical view of homebuilders is linked to the cyclical view on inflation, which is a linear extrapolation that I think is incorrect.

**Other** **Risks**

Obviously there are some risks, some more on an individual company level, which vary.

* I would say that there could be some issues if and when eviction moratoriums start to rise and homeowners are allowed to default on their loans. IE, when the government protection backstopping credit in this industry finally rolls off, there may be some negativity.
* Homebuilders do tend to be *somewhat* cyclical, although I don't really think we're at the point that there would be risks here.  Typically the cyclical risk from homebuilders can come from rising interest rates, which I don't think is something to really think about for another 2-3 years, and even then, builders don't always respond negatively to rising rates.
* As many in this thread have pointed out, Homebuilders are somewhat cyclical, and cheap p/e's are often cheap because the cycle is about to turn. With that said, I think this is where the consensus view is quite wrong as they're just extrapolating the recent inflation moves into the future at the same rate. I'm rather confident this won't be the case (of course you can never be sure however).
* Stimulus programs + covid lifestyle changes likely did fuel some demand for purchasing new homes, which obviously won't be a part of things looking forward.
* Rising home prices \*could\* cool demand, which would cut into profits due to lower housing starts even if margins keep rising due to increased prices.

With that said, homeowner balance sheets have completely reversed since the GFC and that goes for really the industry as a whole. I blame this on PTSD from the financial crisis causing people to focus on de-risking anything relating to homebuilding, mortgages, and real estate.

**TLDR**

* Great current valuation by almost every metric you would use to value a company
* Great growth prospects on both a short term and long term basis (helps to avoid value traps)
* Strong balance sheets reduce risk
* Favorable macro tailwinds on both a short term and long term basis","self","https://redd.it/o6dag9"

*UPDATED TO INCORPORATE FEEDBACK\*\*\**

*TITLE: The Deep, Hidden Value in $TPL (Texas Pacific Land Corp) That Could be Worth as Much as 4x the Current Price One Day*

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Texas Pacific Land Corporation ($TPL) is the largest private landowner in the Permian basin.  It makes money by charging oil producers/pipelines a fee for using their land to extract oil and build facilities on the surface.  It is also building out a water sourcing/disposal business which is becoming critical infrastructure in the Permian.  The company has no debt and spends very little on capex, making the business model asset-light and extremely valuable in what is known to be a capital-intensive, cyclical industry.

**The stock currently trades at around $1,600 per share, which I believe is a fair price for the value of all PDP wells and near-term, high-visibility undeveloped wells under my base case oil forecast.**  But what you are also purchasing is the optionality that comes with TPL's undeveloped well locations.  **If we were to incorporate the value of these locations, the stock should trade at a price more like $5,579, or \~3.5x the current price.**

Stress testing the valuation model under different oil assumptions suggests that downside is limited to -28% ($1,134), while upside in an oil super-cycle scenario could be $1,819 (with $6,891 as the full valuation with all undeveloped wells).

I would expect that in the near-term, stronger oil prices, Russell inclusion, interest in ""inflation plays"", potential inclusion in the S&P, and growing awareness of the company (which should lead to broader sell-side analyst coverage) should support the share price.  Though admittedly, valuations do appear somewhat full in the near-term.

**Brief History of TPL:**

TPL has a long history after having been established in 1888 as a trust that held vast amounts of Texas land as a result of the Texas and Pacific Railway going bankrupt.  Horizon Kinetics, a long-time major investor in TPL, breaks their operating history down into stages in their [1Q21 investor letter](https://horizonkinetics.com/app/uploads/Q1-2021-Review_FINAL.pdf):

&#x200B;

>**Stage 1** for TPL, the corollary to that early stage for Microsoft, would be the first 125 years of TPL’s existence, during which it was essentially unchanged. It just received a relatively constant, modest stream of revenues from grazing fees and easements on its surface acreage, royalties on oil and gas production on properties it had divested in 1955, and periodic land sales. Grazing leases were in effect on over 95% of the Trust’s then roughly 2 million surface acres. Most of this revenue was allocated to share repurchases, which had been ongoing since 1888.  
>  
>**Stage 2** commenced roughly 8 to 10 years ago, when advances in drilling technology suddenly made available the vast, but very deep, oil and gas reserves of the Delaware Basin that had been uneconomic to reach. A public signal of that change was the June 2013 announcement of a joint venture between Chevron and Cimarex to combine contiguous acreage in the region in order to facilitate capital expenditure plans in the many billions of dollars.1  That was the starting gun. From those multi-billion-dollar drilling plans, one could readily deduce the very large volumes of oil and gas these companies expected to produce that would be sufficient to provide the level of profit they expected to earn over a period of decades. Those volumes would translate into royalty revenues to TPL, and the scale on which this would take place was simply enormous in comparison to what TPL was at the time.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6tlvrhhup9771.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=656bafdf7569bde2745b0eba6e9fd2e2e2396643

Note that I do not ascribe value to any of the future potential uses of TPL's land rights that Horizon Kinetics speculates on (i.e. solar farms, crypto mining, real estate development).  But these are obviously attractive opportunities for TPL.

&#x200B;

**Step #1: Valuing the Surface Acreage:**

The valuation of the surface acreage (excluding royalty rights) is the easiest of the three segments to value.  Land is worth something, even if it doesn't have any economic value per-se.  The easiest way to estimate the value of TPL's 880k of acreage is to look at past land transactions that don't involve royalty interests.  The table below shows that over the past few year, an acre has historically transacted at a median price of $3,803/acre.  So assuming a 25% corporate tax rate, the after-tax value of its landholdings should be roughly $2.5bn.  I then apply an uncertainty discount of 35% to account for the fact that not all land is created equal, and without disclosure, it's hard for me to know the true value of TPL's holdings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step #2: Valuing the Water Sourcing/Disposal Business:**

The valuation of TPL's water business (TPWR) is slightly more complicated, particularly because it is so new.  However, TPL provides us with useful information in their investor presentations that can help us value the business.

The water business can be broken down into two segments: disposal and sourcing.  Disposal is a service provided by TPWR for oil and gas companies to dispose of the water that is generated as a byproduct of digging up oil.  The water is either disposed of by putting it back in the ground, or treated and recycled for the oil production process.  The second segment, sourcing, is naturally that: delivering water for oil and gas producers to use while they drill.

TPL's latest investor presentation tells us that they have \~2800 mbbl/d of active salt water disposal wells (SWD), and \~2700 mbbl/d of permitted SWDs.  We also know from their March 2020 presentation that general terms for disposal are for 5-10 year contracts at a price of $0.10-$0.20/barrel, and that contracts generally renew with a 15% price hike.  Using this information, we can imply that TPL has a \~34% share of SWDs in the Delaware/Midland region (the basins where the majority of TPL land occupies).

I estimate TPL should be the dominant player in these regions, given its competitive advantage, that it owns the land.  Because it owns the land, it doesn't have to pay a royalty to another third party, which means its prices can be more competitive than others.  So I expect its market share to rise to 65% over the next 10 years.

I obtain produced water volume estimates in the Delaware/Midland regions in 2020 and 2030 from an old Raymond James report on the matter.  And I assume that the SWDs operate at a 75% utilization rate to be conservative.

**Net-net: I estimate that TPL has \~$1bn in potential royalty revenue from its disposal operations in 2030** (which I will aggregate with its sourcing revenue potential, and discount back to present value).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next step is value the sourcing business.  TPL also provides us with some useful statistics in their latest investor presentation.  We get that they covered around 1300 mbbl/d of produced water volumes (40% capture rate in the Delaware, $0.11/bbl) and around 350 sourced water volumes (30% capture rate in the Delaware, $0.45/bbl).  Note that at the moment, TPL's sourcing only covers the Delaware basin.  Given TPL's land ownership rights in Midland, I would expect TPL to grow its footprint there as well.

Similarly, as seen above, terms for sourcing contracts last between 2-15 years.  I also assume that these contracts come with renewal at a 15% price hike.  I assume a similar mix of produced/sourced water, and I assume that TPL grows its share to 65% of the Delaware/Midland produced water volumes, but 45% of sourced volumes (given there is somewhat less of a competitive advantage for TPL for sourced volumes).

&#x200B;

Lastly, I combine the two revenue streams into one.  I build in a 60% EBIT margin (achieved in 2019, which may be conservative given my expectations for the oil price and the likely operating leverage that comes with it), and a capex to revenues ratio of 20% (which might be too high given capex should slow to maintenance-type levels as the business matures).  And I assign a 12.5x multiple on the terminal value of this business.  **And discount everything back to present value to obtain a fair value of TPWR of almost $5bn.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step #3: Valuing the Oil and Gas Royalties:**

The last and most important step is valuing the oil and gas royalties.  TPL provides us with inventory information.  I've recreated that table and backed out the implied EUR (estimated ultimate recovery) of a well in each basin.  I assume a 45%/55% oil/gas mix, and I flex the natural gas price on my WTI assumptions using their relationship during the last cycle.  We can then plug in assumptions for WTI and simulate a production schedule.  Then we simply aggregate up using TPL's well count and discounting it back to present value.

The vast majority of TPL's deep value lies in its gross undeveloped resources, which are immense.  Naturally, this portion of the business has the lowest visibility, which makes it hard to want to give the company credit for it today.  Maybe over the course of 10 years, shareholders will accrue this value.

**Dr Martens PLC**

**Ticker:** DOCS

**Latest Price:** 439.60p

**Market Cap:** £4.4bn (c. $6.1bn)

Dr Martens is a UK listed company with >60 years of heritage. The company sells footwear across the world and is known for its iconic boots which encompass the signature yellow welt stitch style and the grooved sole. They predominately target the ‘young and rebellious’ type of consumer although these days their business targets many demographics, including kids. They also sell accessories like shoe related care products and variations of its signature brand.

Their timeless 1460 boot accounted for 42% of their FY20 revenues. EMEA, Americas and APAC respectively accounted for 43%, 38% and 18% of revenues. Men and Women account for roughly a 50:50 split for its products recently and historically.

The company went public in January 2021 at 370p per share. The main selling shareholder Permira retained a >40% stake in the company post IPO.

There’s not a lot of historic information going far back available but there’s enough I think to form an informed opinion. I could go on about the company but for the sake of brevity I will get to the meat of the thesis.

# The Market

As per the IPO prospectus, Statista estimates that in 2019, global retail sales of footwear were £341bn with about 12bn pairs. The industry grew 4.8% CAGR between 2014-2019 and is projected to grow 5.5% between 2020-2025 to reach £439bn. Leather footwear represented 33% of the market but the company thinks it competes in the other footwear categories too. Dr Martens has the highest share (36%) of consumers who “wear the brand for almost everything” when compared to peers.

The company calculates that there are an additional 154 million potential consumers in their countries of presence who share similar attitudinal profiles to the 16 million current consumers here who’ve bought a Dr Martens in the last two years. In assuming the current typical frequency of purchase and average spend per purchase in each market, the company estimates that these 170m total customers indicate potential headroom of >£6bn of annual sales (FY2021 company sales were £773m). Even then, the company thinks the total addressable market is a lot more than £6bn given geographical presence can be expanded outside current countries and penetration within these countries could be deeper.

# Attractive Investment Characteristics

**High returns on capital:** Returns on Capital Employed (lease adjusted, after tax) averaged 19% the last three full years of trading. Excluding Goodwill, this number comes to 36%. Cash Return on Capital Invested (lease adjusted) averaged 16% L3Y (I view above 10% as good).

**High margins:** Adjusted EBIT margins were 12.4% in 2018, 16.4% in 2019, 23.1% in 2020 and 24.5% in 2021. The company is benefitting from operating leverage as it expands. Profit margin averaged 9% last 3 years.

**Quality of earnings**: cash conversion has been solid last 3 years (and not derived from working capital tailwinds either).

**Low leverage**: massively de-levered from its days as a private company, latest FY Net Debt / EBITDA (lease adjusted) stands at 1.15x and the company is guiding for 1x at current year end.

**Cash generative enough to sustain growth/not reliant on outside capital to grow**: self-explanatory.

**Tried and tested product across the world**: the product is already accepted across many countries such as France, UK, US and China. This gives scaling significantly less execution risk than, say, a company expanding its product abroad for the first time. See demographic summary below (from the prospectus):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/104oqozjdu771.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2d549c7201f65bd2182ee90736556e79cfed6f3

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zj1ykpvkdu771.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67141aef36e928942bd16581ab9f0b4505c8523c

**Pricing power**: Going by volume of pairs sold each year, the company has been growing total numbers sold by 21% CAGR for the last 5 years. This compares to an overall revenue growth of 28% CAGR in that time which both suggests volume driving the majority of revenues and that the product has enough price inelasticity to keep growing despite price increases.

**Timeless Product:** Dr Martens boots have survived through the ages, with the waxing and waning of fashion trends and latest consumer tastes. Additionally, inventory write-downs are de-risked in that the company has less reliance on the ‘latest’ product than your average fashion company.

**Director ownership:** CEO and CFO own 1.1% and 0.6% of the shares respectively. An additional independent NED recently purchased 20,000 shares at 420p on 21st June 2021.

# Positive Drivers Going Forward

**Operating leverage to drive margin expansion:** the company benefits greatly from selling more shoes to more people. Adjusted operating margins have been trending up yearly since 2016, from 10.9% to 24.5% in FY2021. Gross margins have gone from 48% to 61%.

**Increasing Direct to Consumer through retail and ecommerce:** The company presently operates through both the Direct to Consumer (DTC) and Direct to Wholesaler markets. DTC includes e-commerce and retail sales, which together made up 43% of sales in FY2021. The company has guided that it wants to focus more on DTC going forward whilst maintaining key supplier relationships with selected wholesalers. This will likely give Dr Martens better cash management and better margins going forward. As of FY2021, e-commerce made up 30% of total sales and the company’s medium-term target is 40% for that and 60% for DTC in total. During the last 5 years, the company has increased its e-commerce sales by 64% CAGR.

**General footprint expansion**: Dr Martens is growing fast in a hugely untapped market. They are guiding to 20-25 new store openings in FY22 (latest total is 135). Sales per store growth has averaged 16% over the last 3 years albeit a substantially lower rate last year owing to the mass closure of retail. Total group-wide revenue growth has averaged 31% over the same 3 years whilst adjusted EBIT averaged 67%.

**Dividend initiation this year should increase Fund managers’ interests:** The company will initiate a dividend payout between 25%-35% of earnings going forward and I suspect this will attract many funds with income mandates towards the stock. As the company gets bigger it should attract even more market attention.

**Substantial untapped market potential:** As detailed in ‘The Market’ above, there is a huge untapped market for the company to take share of.

**Consumer tastes away from formal to casual wear:** As the trend towards less formal wear, more casual grows stronger, I think the Dr Martens boot is well poised to benefit.

# Key Risks

**Goodwill is 37% of Assets**: this is probably the biggest risk to me as an equity investor here. This is a bit too high for comfort and goodwill impairment risk needs to be taken on board when calculating the cost of equity for this company.

**Slower than anticipated growth:** it can happen. The company is guiding to high teens revenue growth in FY2022 and henceforth mid-teens revenue growth in the medium term. An estimated Earnings Power Valuation of the company shows me that prospective growth makes up c. 38% of the company’s current equity valuation which is not too bad for a fast grower. I typically try to avoid buying at prices >50% of which incorporate future growth expectations.

# Other Interesting Information

IPO selling Private Equity shareholder Permira retained a >40% in the company.

I should also mention that the company uses the franchise model in locations where it doesn’t have an angle. As of the date of IPO it had 107 additional franchise stores, primarily in China, Japan, Australia and Canada. It attributes these revenues to the ‘Wholesale’ segment.

# Valuation

I assume a number of valuation metrics to ascertain a rough measure of fair value:

* A Free Cash Flow DCF gives me a fair value estimate around 504p – 580p, upside of 15% - 32%.
* A Greenwald Franchise Valuation gives me a prospective (post franchise-fade probability) return of c. 22% on last share price.
* For those interested in multiples: The company is trading at 29x forward PE, 28x forward EV/NOPAT, 18x forward EV/EBITDA and a trailing FCF yield (excl. estimated growth capex) of 2.8%.
* Another interesting way to look at this I thought is to value the company based on the potential sales headroom of £6bn that the company has targeted. If you assume that one day they will capture this, at 25% operating margin and assuming a 25% tax rate, the company could potentially have a NOPAT of £1.125bn. Attributing a much lower and conservative EV/NOPAT multiple of 20x down the line, this would give the company a potential Enterprise Value of £22.5bn, compared to the current £4.7bn. If the company is correct they think their sales could be even more. Just another interesting way to think about it.

Happy to talk about any of the above in more detail.

In my view this is a classic Peter Lynch expansion stock caught early. Happy to provide more information on anything but didn’t want to overload. Please let me know if you spot any mistakes anywhere. Keen for any thoughts or feedback. Cheers for reading.","self","https://redd.it/o91hgm"

A former Honeywell subsidiary, Garrett has been in the turbocharger business for over 60 years. The company, which has a cult following (see image of customer tattoos at the end of this email), shares a duopoly position with #2 market leader, BorgWarner (30% market share).

Garrett was spun out of Honeywell in late 2018 under the official guise of ""business simplification."" In reality, Honeywell used the spinoff to dump over $1.3 billion of asbestos litigation claims associated with its old Bendix brake business from the 1980s. As a result, Garrett was stuck making onerous annual payments to resolve asbestos claims associated with a business that it had nothing to do with. After numerous negotiation attempts with Honeywell failed, Garrett voluntarily filed for Ch. 11 in September 2020.

Companies usually often file for bankruptcy due to either liquidity or solvency issues. In most of these situations, the poor business economics that led to the bankruptcy in the first place have not changed post-restructuring. However, a third more rare reason for filing bankruptcy exists: to restructure a contingent liability that is unrelated to the core business. In this case, Garrett filed because it had more leverage in the Chapter 11 process to reduce its Honeywell asbestos payments. After a 7-month long reorganization and competitive auction process, GTX emerged in April 2021 with the original equity intact, a cleaner balance sheet, and significantly reduced asbestos liabilities.

As a quick industry overview, a turbocharger uses a vehicle's exhaust gas to spin a fan that forces more air (and thus more fuel) into an engine than it could otherwise naturally consume. It allows an engine to generate as much or more power than a larger non-turbo engine, thereby reducing emissions and improving fuel economy (by up to 20% and 40% for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively). As a result, the adoption of turbochargers has increased significantly over the last two decades as fuel efficiency and emission standards have become stricter across the world. In 2000, only 1% of light-duty vehicles came with turbochargers. By 2019, \~50% of all new light-duty vehicles produced globally came equipped with a turbo. This figure is growing annually (excluding 2020), as turbos continue to be heavily incorporated into both pure-ICE and hybrid vehicles. Thus, despite the looming shadow of electric vehicles, the global turbocharger industry is expected to grow at a \~10% CAGR until 2027, with Asia becoming the fastest growing and largest market.

Garrett has an impregnable competitive position with high barriers to entry in the industry. In fact, Bosche and Mahle, two of the largest auto suppliers in the world, formed a JV in 2008 to capitalize on the anticipated skyrocketing demand for turbochargers and in the process, try and break the Garrett/BorgWarner duopoly. Almost a decade later, despite the turbo market's actual growth surpassing all projections, Bosche and Mahle conceded and sold the JV to a Hong Kong PE firm in 2017. The reason was that they failed to achieve economies of scale and gave up trying to invest more capital to try and make more headway into the industry. Essentially, the 60+ years of engineering, product development, and auto OEM relationships at both Garrett and BorgWarner proved impossible to beat. Furthermore, turbochargers are incorporated into engines early in the design process and years in advance, leading to very high switching costs once production begins. This also gives GTX strong revenue visibility, with 95% of 2022, 88% of 2023, and 80% of 2024 revenues already contracted. The company is also well-diversified across geographies and customers.

The elephant in the room, of course, is electric vehicles. Since EVs have no exhaust, turbochargers will be nonexistent in a full EV world. However, we are still extremely far away from that, and even as the EV market continues to rapidly grow, it will only further speed up the adoption of turbochargers as the pressure ramps up on ICE and hybrids to become more fuel efficient and powerful. Furthermore, the proposed holding period for this investment is much shorter than the time it will take for the turbocharger market to begin declining due to EVs (likely closer to 2030 and beyond).

Currently, GTX shares trade at \~6x 2021 earnings and \~5x 2022 earnings vs. 12x and 11x at BorgWarner. GTX also has 20% higher EBITDA margins than Borg (18% vs. 15%) and nearly identical leverage (1.1x vs 0.9x). GTX is also growing revenues faster than BWA and the overall industry: Q1 2021 revenues came in +19% over Q1 2019 (since 2020 comparisons are irrelevant), while BWA Q1 2021 revenues were flat, and the global auto market was down more than 11% seasonally adjusted. Given that Garrett is growing by a double digit margin over both its largest competitor and the overall industry, it can even be argued that the stock deserves to trade at a premium to BWA. It has also become evident that management projected very conservative financials to its lenders during restructuring. This was likely to minimize the perceived value of the business while financing was lined up and to keep the stock price low as the new compensation structure and associated stock and option strike price awards were being set. To illustrate, Q1 2021 guidance given in late February to lenders was $868 million revenue and $129 million EBITDA. Actual numbers came out to $997 million revenue and $176 million EBITDA. Thus, there's a strong chance we will get the sweet spot of both multiple expansion and stronger-than-expected earnings growth.

Furthermore, several prominent PE firms and distressed debt hedge funds including Oaktree, Centerbridge, and Baupost led the company out of the restructuring process and provided most of the equity injection in the form of convertible preferred stock ($5.25 conversion price, 1:1 common). Including the now in-the-money preferred stock that will be mandatorily converted in under 2 years, these firms collectively own over 75% of GTX and are very incentivized to see the share price trade much higher.The stock was already uplisted onto the NASDAQ in early May, which provided a nice bump to the stock price. Remaining catalysts include the listing of the preferred stock, planned simplification of the capital structure (from currently equity + 2 classes of preferred stock + bank debt to just equity + bank debt), and continued strong financial performance. Full sell-side analyst coverage should also resume in the near future, further attracting more investor interest.

To conclude, Garrett did not enter restructuring because it had liquidity or solvency issues. In fact, the company continued to generate strong financial results throughout that time. Now that the company has emerged, we have the opportunity to buy a high-quality, growing business at a huge discount, thanks to the bankruptcy association (regardless of the reason). I expect the stock to re-rate significantly as the company continues to generate strong financial results, and the bankruptcy connotation wears off over time.

**My Past Success**

I invested in WLFC prior to its take-private offer and posted a DD on my profile. I earned \~36% profit in 2 months from this trade.

I think it's important to put this at the top so people take me seriously as this will take a few minutes to read.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lt4p75/wlfc\_a\_true\_value\_opportunity\_in\_the\_airline/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lt4p75/wlfc_a_true_value_opportunity_in_the_airline/)

You can see by post date that I wrote that DD prior to the take-private offer. I have learned a lot since then.

**Introduction**

Elevate is a fintech company aiming to seamlessly and cheaply (relative) provide instalment loans, lines of credit, and now credit cards to subprime Americans.

The company developed as a product of \~1/3 of all Americans belonging to what's known as the subprime credit class. These individuals cannot access funds easily through traditional banking systems and often don't have capital reserves to cover emergencies.

Normally, such individuals turn to brick and mortar payday loan stores, ""mom and pop"" shops or smaller franchises, and are faced with APRs (annual percentage rates) on their loans of over 400%. Elevate on the other hand aims to provide similar sized loans *without* the need for brick and mortar at rates of \~100%, a quarter of what these customers can typically access; their new credit card has an APR of 30% and has experienced tremendous growth.

Elevate operates by offering three loan products: Rise, Elastic, and Today. *Rise* is their instalment load product, *Elastic* is their line of credit product, and the *Today* card is their new credit card. Collectively, their average, relative APR for all products hovers above 100%. *Rise* and *Elastic* make up the bulk of their revenues, but their *Today* card has multiplied over the past year.

Elevate must charge a high APR because instalment loans are often paid within a few months (instalment loan rates are typically marketed as ""$12 for every $100 loaned per month"") and because they are dealing with subprime customers. Unfortunately, delinquency rates are higher with these individuals as are incidences of fraud. They must account for this by charging higher rates as they set aside large sums of money in anticipation of charge-offs.

Beyond offering rates towards subprime customers that are a quarter of what they could get from traditional payday loan companies, Elevate goes even further and submits information to the US Credit Bureau upon successful payment, thus allowing subprime individuals to build credit and eventually become prime, hence **elevating** them from their current financial situation.

There. The company name was used in a sentence.

Now that you've gotten a brief introduction on the company, let's jump into the details. I am going to list a series of bullet points for both the good and the bad and then I will dive into them, if necessary, below.

**Pros**

As a deep value investor, I focus on fundamentals first. So, let's dive into some of the more important metrics and ratios that made this company stick out to me.

* **The company is trading at 80% of its tangible book value**

An obvious plus, this company has had consecutive years of positive earnings and thus is not eroding at shareholder equity. Importantly, equity was not reduced during COVID.

* **The company's TTM reported income is 38.2m$ but more importantly and accurately, its TTM income from operations is 42.56m$ (I calculated this, YF has it at 40.99m$). Consequently, the company's ROE is 26.6%**

The company discontinued its operations in the UK. While it was winding down, it cost the company several million dollars in litigation as well as costs for closing the business. During some quarters, its discontinued operations also provided it with \~4m$. I think it is unwise to consider these operations and the losses they had on the company as they have no bearing on how profitable the company is in the US which is where it now operates in its entirety. If the company's operations provided \~42m$ in the US over the past twelve months and it had to pay 12m$ in legal fees for closing down shop in the UK, that doesn't mean the company was only able to produce 30m$ in the US last year.

* **The company has TTM FCF of \~51.38m$**

Unlike what YF spits out in their cash-flow statement, the company actually produced 51.38m$ of FCF. You can find these figures in their own 10Q/Ks by searching ""FCF"". Regardless, we are looking at 51.38m$ of free cashflow for a company that currently costs 127.7m$. 

Annually, they produce enough cash to buy back 40% of themselves.. and they almost did that.

* **The company has repurchased 21.3% of all outstanding shares since April 2020**

The company began buying back shares in November of 2019, however the number of shares is negligible. January 2020 was the first big month of repurchases and the company bought >700k shares at an average price of 4.86/share. It is also in January of 2020 where the BoD approved a 20m$ increase for the company's then 10m$ share buyback program.

Good timing, because after COVID began, we saw the beginning of one of the most incredible share buyback campaigns I have ever seen.

Their 2020 10K summarized their repurchases and let shareholders know that they had bought back an astounding 7.69m shares at an average price of \~2.57/share (spending 19.8m$). Further, in January of 2021, they got their BoD to approve a further 25m$ increase to their then 30m$ buyback program, increasing it to a whopping 55m$ (43% of the company's current market cap).

Now interestingly, a stipulation of their buyback program is that they can only spend 25m$ of it per FY. So, what did the company do with this 25m$ of capacity available for buying back stock in 2021? They spent 14.4m$ or 57.5% of it in the first four months alone at an average price of 4.05/share, a 13.4% premium over the stock's current price. 

It should be noted that the 10.8m$ they spent in 1Q (just Jan, Feb, March, not April), 43% of their annual capacity for repurchases, was at an average price of 4.36/share, a 22% premium to the stock's current price.

IMO, this might be the most important part of this entire DD. Management itself thought it prudent to use almost half of their repurchasing authorization in 3 months at a price 22% higher than where the company currently trades. 

They knew the insider selling pressure would slow and they must have thought it was the end of the absurd undervaluing of the company.

* **The stock has been crushed by constant downward pressure (effectively offsetting the mass repurchases) by Linda Stinson, Tyler Head, and Sequoia Capital selling 10-20% of the total daily trade volume every day, without fail. This finally came to an end on July 6th.**

A massive thorn in Elevate's side has been the selling of the stock by three pesky ""individuals"". However, we must dive a little deeper to understand this selling.

First, Linda Stinson, an owner of >10% of the company (beneficiary from her father, Mike Stinson, who founded Elevate) has been reducing her stake in the company over time. At the same time, Tyler W Head has reduced his stake in Elevate to 0, selling \~10% of the daily trading volume of the stock every day, without fail. It's important to know that Tyler W Head has voting power over the shares held by the ""Mike and Linda Stinson"" trust. This leads me to believe that Tyler Head and Linda Stinson are married or are connected in some way and together they are reducing their stake in the company, albeit still holding a substantial portion of it. Currently, Linda holds 3.44m shares of Elevate.

Another individual wrote a DD on this company and also claimed that Tyler Head and Linda Stinson were married, but I am not sure where he found this information. I will link the DD here:

[https://plumcapital.substack.com/p/plum-capital-post-1-elevate-credit](https://plumcapital.substack.com/p/plum-capital-post-1-elevate-credit)

Sequoia Capital is another story and they are related to Elevate from its Think Finance days (over a decade ago) and their indiscriminate selling is due to the fact that their stake in Elevate is pennies to them and they were selling it regardless of the stock's price.

Finally, TCV V LP reduced their stake in the company. Their stake in the company has changed over the past 13 months, at times adding, at times subtracting. They currently own 3.224m shares of Elevate. Importantly, they sold the entire stake they wished to depart with in a dark pool to another substantial buyer, if I had to guess Elevate itself.

However, it seems that **finally** us Elevate shareholders have peace and can finally reap some benefits from the share buybacks the company has been doing for over a year. Now, there is consistent upward pressure, assuming the buybacks continue. This is something to watch carefully in the coming months.

* **The company's loan technology is ever-improving and they are facing fewer delinquencies with each year's loan vintage.**

I'll attach a picture from the company's most recent 10Q.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/bT2aOzJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bT2aOzJ)

* **Great intangibles that make me think the company has great management and happy employees.**

The company's CEO, Jason Harvison, is a finalist for a national competition held by EY meant to determine the Entrepreneur of the year for America Southwest. He also holds 416k shares of Elevate, valued at \~1.5m$

The company's CIO, Joan Keuhl, recently won the national CIO of the year ORBIE award.

Chris Lutes, the company's CFO, holds 592k shares of Elevate, valued at 2.11m$.

The company as a whole was named as one of the best workplaces in all of Texas.

In the shareholders call transcript, you can find such quotes from Jason ""over the first quarter, Elevate repurchased 2.5 million shares, roughly 6.5% of our outstanding shares. I won't say a lot here, but clearly we believe our company is very undervalued relative to both current profitability and most certainly profitability we believe is possible in the years ahead"" and ""as long as Elevate is undervalued, we will continue to utilize our authorization to repurchase shares"".

\-

So, in summary there are a number of positives for this company. However, I don't provide unbiased DDs and I have some concerns so now I would like to review the negatives.

**Cons**

Elevate, by virtue of the business it is in, has a terrible reputation. Several articles single it out alone, despite there being larger competitors in the industry (ENVA, another very strong company). I cannot find the article now but if I find it I will link it - in it it falsely states that ELVT charges >400% APRs but this is **not** true whatsoever.

Regardless, half of the population, and unfortunately the political party in power, does not understand the benefit and service Elevate provides to its clients and wants to shut it down.

* **The regulatory environment is not conducive to companies that provide high APR products**

While I don't have as many cons for this company, this one is a doozie.

You can see in Elevate's own 10K that they can only offer their products in 35-38 states. This is because some states have interest rate caps set to 36% APR. While I feel this is a poor blanket solution that hurts subprime individuals and limits them from getting money during times of crises, legislators don't care how I or any other Elevate shareholder feels.

In the past, Federal interest rate caps have been suggested (a cap of 36% which would obviously be detrimental to Elevate's operations, but also ENVA's and CURO's, both of which have recovered). However, it has been suggested in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019, 3 of which were during liberal governments and 2 of which during liberal Congresses, and it has never passed.

With Congress' overturning of the true lender rule, Elevate can no longer partner with national banks that are headquartered in states without an interest rate cap. Therefore Elevate can no longer bypass the state interest rate caps and offer their services in states with said caps. However, there is still plenty of business to be done.

* **Unsure if the insider buying is a scam to pay off insiders who want to leave, but seeing as the CEO and CFO each have 1.5 and 1.8m$ in the company, I don't think that's the case.**

A thought I had recently was that maybe Elevate was colluding with the insiders who were selling their shares. Were the buybacks conducted to soak up the shares insiders wanted to sell without causing the stock price to plummet? I doubt it, but I am extremely paranoid when I invest and therefore any whiff of something shady going on, I try and investigate or rationalize whether it is a credible threat.

Frankly, I am not sure how these buybacks could be a net negative, however they could be an indication management doesn't know how to grow their loan book/want to and this is the most creative use they could find for their excess cash rather than it be the most productive. I'm inclined to believe it is their best option given the deep undervaluation of this company, but it is something to consider to avoid being blinded by ""20% buybacks in a year, definite buy"".

* **Revenues have stagnated over the past few years and shrunk during 2020**

However, I think that this must be taken with a grain of salt. Prior to Jason taking the helm, the previous CEO was hellbent on loan origination and was promoting the company as a high growth tech company. In reality, Elevate is a fintech company that operates as a subprime lender and thus is somewhere between Fintech and a bank.

So, the past CEO pushed for growth quantity, and not growth quality. I think the difference in leadership styles can be seen as instead of taking the 52m$ in free cashflow and forcing origination, the company has instead decided to put it towards buying back their own stock at a price they know is unreasonably low, rewarding themselves, the company itself, shareholders, and biding time until originations make more sense.

**Projections**

***Based on Book Value***

The simplest future projection would be for this stock to trade at at least its book value. As per the most recent 10Q, TBV of the company was \~160m$ and there were \~35.7m shares outstanding. Based on those figures, the company could reach 4.47/share.

However, I think we can take it a stretch further. I think it's safe to assume that they have repurchased 1-2m more shares while having every stock option being used so let's assume there are now 34m shares. The company has steadily been increasing its equity by 3-4m$ per quarter. Given these numbers, TBV/share could be 4.82/share.

***Based on Earnings***

The company is trading at a P/E of about 3. CURO is currently trading at a P/E of 12 and ENVA (which had elevated earnings by \~160m$ due to a bargain purchase realized in October of 2020. While these are entirely real profits and I am not discounting them, this had nothing to do with operational income which I am using in ELVT's sake) is trading at a P/E of 4.

It's hard to say what the industry average P/E is for such firms, however, I think both Enova and Elevate are supremely undervalued, and given Curo is trading at a P/E of 12 they both have room to 2-3x. Further, Enova is trading at a slight premium to book value, 1.72x TBV. A small bonus as well, both Elevate and Enova have goodwill, Enova **much** more so, but both have had no goodwill impairments.

Based on earnings, I think Elevate can comfortably double, but it could appreciate to Enova's P/E or it it and Enova could climb to trade at Curo's P/E. Thus, the range is anywhere from 4.74 (1.33x to match a P/E of 4) to 6.72 (1.5x TBV of 160m$ divided by 35.7m shares) to 14.28 (4x to match a P/E of 12).

***Summarized Projections***

I'll keep it simple, I will say the lower bound optimistic price for Elevate is a small premium to its book value at a certainly lower share count, thus I think Elevate should trade at *at least* 4.70/share. Management clearly agrees as it paid 4.86/share in January of 2020 when the company was worse in every way (equity, income). They also paid 4.36/share in 1Q 2021, though I concede their average purchase price/share over the buyback period is below the current price of the company.

The upper bound of Elevate's optimistic price would be for it and Enova to trade at realistic P/E ratios given their incredible earning power and strong book values and this would be \~12.xx/share.

It shouldn't have to be re-stated but Elevate's management clearly thinks the same thing and that is why they've bought back >1/5th of the company in under a year and have the capacity to buy another 1/5th this year if they feel so. Any company that is deeply positive and has bought back 20% of their shares and is ready to buy back another 20% is pretty attractive to me.

I would love to hear your opinions on Elevate, on its competitors, or on why you think it is a bad idea and have an edge to know that companies like Elevate might not be around much longer.

eBay  at 15xFCF the stock is cheap and underappreciated due to prior missteps and poor historical business execution. However, a new CEO is revitalizing with a focus back to unique goods driving GMV lift. Also accelerated internalization of payments ($PYPL just reported EBAY to even further accelerate move to 100% internal by end of Q321!)  will drive strong revenue and profit growth. We believe EBAY is poised to deliver strong stock appreciation.

  Financial model incorporates take-rate expansion from payment internalization and advertising revenue growth, resulting in net income to growth to $3B USD in 2022. Add in continued strong stock buybacks, results in 2022 EPS of $4.80/sh. Note however, we conservatively expect 2021 to have difficult GMV compares due to the pandemic induced acceleration of e-commerce online as bricks-and-mortar stores were closed and people were sheltered in-place at home and have assumed below historical e-commerce growth for 2022.   Any GMV growth is upside to these targets.

Price Target $113/sh

Incorporated in Las Vegas, listed on the Nasdaq but with its operations are in Russia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus. It has ""no name"" auditors and lawyers, and despite its publicly listing, given the owner's large percentage ownership of the stock, iFreedom Holding's essentially a private company. 

By design this bank and brokerage firm falls through the regulatory cracks and as such is accountable to few. More importantly, almost nothing Freedom Holding's public filings says make any sense from a traditional business sense. 

For all that, its market capitalization is approaching $4 billion.","self","https://redd.it/owgycw"

The investment opportunity was largely driven by panic selling amidst the uncertainty of the COVID-19 virus. Year-to-date I have more than doubled my money.

To give some background the business; Vertu Motors is a UK car dealership company, which has 155 dealerships spread around the country. Its dealerships are (now) operated under three brands (Bristol Street Motors, Macklin Motors and Vertu), that mostly focus on volume brands. Vertu began trading in 2006 as a cash shell and has grown through acquisitions – using a combination of capital and, until a few years ago, share issuance. It has built a very well-balanced portfolio of car brands, in other words, the car brands they hold represent quite well the share each brand has of new car sales in the UK. Vertu is also led by founder and CEO, Robert Forrester, that has a strong accounting background and that had a successful stint at Reg Vardy (another UK car dealership that got sold to Pendragon in 2005).

Vertu does about +£3bn in sales – approximately 175,000 new and used cars sold, with average price of +£17,000. In a normal year, gross margins are about 11%. 90% of the gross margin is used to cover operating costs. You’re left with a profit margin of about 1%. It’s about volume. It has a very solid net-cash balance sheet which is a rarity amongst the industry. And unlike what common sense might indicate, (new and used, not used) car dealerships make a lot of money from selling used cars and through aftersales (parts + service). One can observe that used car sales and aftersales business will typically account for 50% of revenue, but 75% of gross profit. It follows then that new car sales are important in the sense that they decrease the average age of the car parc, which in turn generates more aftersales business (because people generally only take the car to the official brand dealership for aftersales when the car is relatively new).

Naturally, the car dealership business is very capital-intensive business. Not only do you need a lot of property (to showcase cars), but you also need a lot of inventory (cars). But that’s ok. I paid a very low price for Vertu Motors. Market concerns when I invested included: (1) Brexit, (2) GBP exchange rate, (3) COVID, (4) car dealership business stigma, (5) more share issuance.

One positive backdrop for the industry is that it’s been marked by consolidation. There’s been a big decline in the number of dealerships since the 1980s and at the same time you have more cars being sold each year. On average, each dealership is doing more business today. Furthermore, competition in the auto dealership is limited by the fact that the auto manufacturer needs to award you a franchise. The manufacturer will not award more franchises than are needed in a particular area as this would cannibalize existing dealers. This explain why gross margins are so, so stable – most people go to the dealership in their area.

Since my investment, the company reported it’s FY2021 results (year ends in February) and has issued several trading updates. For FY2021, the company reported £2.5bn in sales and a PBT of +£22mn – marked by the obvious impact of the lockdown and not being able to sell cars. In May of this year – when the FY2021 results were released – management guided for £24-28mn in PBT for 2022. That guidance has recently been updated to £50-55mn, following an extremely favorable market and a very, very strong used car market (which will increase gross profit margins). In fact, the company’s guidance is that they’ll make no less than £50mn in PBT for the half-year period ending the 31st of August 2022. So, unlike some other competitors, management is assuming they’ll make no/little money in the second half of their FY2022. They’re making this assumption given, primarily, possible car supply constraints.

More recently, and further confirming my prediction that shareholder treatment would be better going forward (no more share issuance because the company has reached critical scale) management just announced a share buy-back program.

I bought Vertu at a valuation of £100mn. £100mn for +£30mn in normalized earnings. This compares to the £500mn Pendragon paid for Reg Vardy’s business in 2005 (Reg Vardy had <100 dealerships, it did however have better margins because of a larger aftersales business).","self","https://redd.it/pbbyzs"

HP is a performance-driven drilling solutions and technologies company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma with operations in all major U.S. onshore oil and gas producing basins as well as South America and the Middle East. They operate under four reporting segments, North America Solutions (Largest segment), Offshore Gulf of Mexico, International Solutions (South America & UAE) and Other. (Small real estate holdings) The current market price is a significant discount to intrinsic value considering the company’s strategic alignment with technology through performance contracts, ability to innovate in an industry slow to adopt, fortified balance sheet, and history of conservative management by a dynamic team. Risks to this company are largely overstated and based on the claim that oil and gas will soon be replaced by green initiatives. The world is slowly trending toward renewable energy, yet it will be many decades before this has a material impact on oil demand. The nature of this companies’ business is very volatile since it is largely dependent on oil prices. This would be worrisome if the company were not conservatively managed. I believe that the company will be worth significantly more in the future as rig activity levels continue to increase due to the price of oil remaining relatively stable. H&P will continue to increase in value as E&Ps are slowly starting to increase CapEx budgets.

**Alignment of Automation Technology with Performance Contracts**

Traditionally HP (and the industry as a whole) has used the day rate model. This model charges a fixed rate per rig per day for the duration of the drilling contract. The new performance-based contracts (first talked about in the Q418 earnings call and implemented in the subsequent Q) charge a base rate and specify bonus payments if key performance indicators are met. Key performance indicators are metrics pertaining to qualitative as well as quantitative drilling factors. These factors are specified when the contract is signed and can vary depending on the customers goals. As of Q2 2021 30% of all US Land contracted rigs were under some type of performance agreement. This number is up from only 10% in Q2 2020. Historically, this industry is slow to embrace change, as seen with the initial roll out of the first Super Spec rigs and Flex 3 Legacy rigs before that. However, customers will continue to increasingly prefer H&P performance contracts because of the value added. This increased adoption is margin accretive for H&P because of the company’s investments in automation technology such as Motive, MagVar, and most importantly, AutoSlide. AutoSlide replaces the directional driller at rig side and lands the bit in the zone faster and more efficient than a human ever could. As previously stated, the industry is slow to adopt change, yet AutoSlide has seen continuously increased adoption since it was first introduced to beta testing in Q4 2018. AutoSlide is now found on 25% of all active H&P rigs. The alignment of auto tech and the ""pay for what you get"" business model is value added for customers and shareholders alike.

**Titan of a Balance Sheet Built by a Conservative Management Team**

The company has been managed conservatively since it was founded and remains so today. It sports a best-in-class debt to capital of 12.2%. It recently ended Q3 2021 with $553mn in cash and STI. (While only having long term debt of $481mn) It also has a revolving credit facility of $750mn which is undrawn. This brings total liquidity to $1.3bn. On March 31, 2020, it cut dividends to $0.25 per share from $0.71 per share to remain agile in the COVID oil crisis environment. As rig activity continues to increase (rig count up 10% in Q3 over Q2) I think the board may consider raising the dividend back to pre-covid levels. The current CEO, John Lindsey, has been at the head since 2014 and has been a career employee since 1987. During the Covid oil demand crisis, the management team quickly cut costs and restructured to maintain agility. As such, the business has continued to generate considerable operating cashflow, a trend that I believe will eventually return to pre covid averages of roughly half a billion dollars annually.

Shares were up about 10% last Friday due to the expectation of a supply imbalance from hurricane ida causing the price of oil to increase. This is just temporary noise. The real value is in the long term recovery.

This is not financial advice. Do your own research. This report is in no way exhaustive of the drilling climate or of H&Ps condition as a company. I currently have around 10% of my portfolio long HP.","self","https://redd.it/pe59f8"

* After Seeing good results, reiterated plans to continue investing AEBITDA growth into growth objectives of growing Opera News in Western markets, scaling Dify in additional geographies and new products, and investing in the Opera Gaming division.

**Opera By the Numbers**

I am using data from 2020 Annual filing(20-F) and the most recent monetization of Opera's 29% preferred shares to make the case on how undervalued Opera is and how market is not giving any valuation to Opera's core business which is generating $245M of annual revenue(FY' 21 estimated) and aggressively investing for future growth by plowing all adjusted EBITDA growth from FY' 20 to expand into new verticals and geographies.

* Market Cap: \~$1B
   * Cash, cash equivalent & marketable securities : \~$200M
   * Book value of starmaker(35% discount/DLOM) : $55M
   * Book value of Nanobank : $266M
   * Book value of Opay(15% discount/DLOM) : $49M
* Opera Core= 1$B - $200M - $370M = $430M
   * Opera GM = 95%
   * Opera's AEBITDA Goal = 25%-30% of revenue
      * Proved from Q4'20 results that they can operate at 28% AEBITDA margin
      * Opera's FY'21 Investments - All adjusted EBITDA growth in FY '21 is invested back in business to expand in Europe and N. America
* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA
   * **Trading at \~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**

**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.

* Opay is valued at \~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera’ stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \~8% which is now worth \~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.
* Starmaker’s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera’s book at massive discount.
* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.

Whichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.

* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~1.6B ( \~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.
* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~2.1B ( \~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential
* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~2.6B ( \~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential
* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY’23, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.

**Opera History**

Opera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.

Now, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.

It also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:

* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY’ 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.
* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.

It also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.

**Opera Products**

**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.

**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.

**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.

**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.

**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.

**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.

**Business Model**

* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.
* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:
   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.
   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.
* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.

**Financials**

Opera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.

Opera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY ‘20. It has forecasted FY ‘21 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.

With covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.

Opera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY ‘23 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.

**Opera's Minority Stake**

* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.
* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.
* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 ‘21 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.

**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**

1. **Conservative/Bear Case**

Starmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 ‘20. In Q1 ‘21, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 ‘21 revenue and $68M Q4 ‘21 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \[ 4\*(45+68)/2 \]

Opay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \[12 \* (445 + 2000)/2 \] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 ‘21 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY ‘21 gives Q4 ‘21 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY ‘21 revenue of $116M.

Before we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :

* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY ‘21,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 ‘22 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY’22.
* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.
* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay

**📷**

The above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera’s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.

1. **Base Case**

The base case assumes the market will give Opera’s high gross margin(\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.

📷

1. **Bull Case**

As if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \*significant\* additional upside to base case.

* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera’s take rate is 30%, dify’s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera’s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.
* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.
* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.

Assuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY ‘21(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY ‘22( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.

📷

**Catalyst**

* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M
* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.
* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.
* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.
* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.
* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)
* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.
* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.

**Short Report**

Opera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then, time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.

It does this by calculating and accumulating **Owner’s earnings**. This is not another research tool. This spreadsheet targets your psychology to make it much easier to invest and hold onto great businesses for the long-run

# What does this spreadsheet do?

This spreadsheet puts you in the position of a business owner, who collects the [earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/) of their companies on a regular basis. When you own a share you own a part of the business and therefore receive a part of its profits. It does so by automatically tracking and accumulating your Owner’s earnings your shares. All you got to do is input your transactions — ticker symbol, date purchased, number of shares purchased, and share price.

By removing total portfolio value or day-to-day share price, which is not only irrelevant to long-term investing (mostly), but also suboptimal insofar as it can evoke volatile emotions and trigger poor decisions, as all brokerages do, this spreadsheet helps you make calmer decisions and stay invested.

*For those of you unfamiliar with* [*Owner's earnings*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/peo0rp/owners_earnings_how_to_value_a_companys_moat_and/)*, it represents how much cash falls into the business owner’s pockets. Basically it is the amount of cash you’re left with after you spend on whatever you need to to maintain, but not grow, the business and is a more realistic and accurate portrayal of a company's intrinsic value than EPS, Operating Cash or FCF. Here's* [Amazon's](https://m.imgur.com/a/Cis6Hdl) *side-by-side to prove it.*

# How will it make you a better long-term investor?

This spreadsheet and the formula behind it have been meticulously designed to make you a better long-term investor. The formula is as follows:

Your earnings = Owner's earnings per share \* number of shares you own \* days held/period

To maximize your earnings, you must maximize each of its components. In doing so, you will have achieved the holy grail of long-term value investing:

**1. Invest in great companies with wide moats**

To maximize owner’s earnings you must invest in [great companies with wide moats](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/p8r2lk/how_i_find_investments_that_outearn_outlive_and/) that can and will grow their earnings at a high rate for many years into the future. You don't want a company whose earnings stay the same year after year, you want a company that can grow as fast as possible for as long as possible.

**2. Buy stocks at a discount instead of panicking when it falls**

To maximize the number of shares you own you must hunt for value and bargains. You have a limited amount of money to invest so you naturally want to buy as many shares (or earnings) as you can with that money. If two similar companies make $10 a year, one of them selling for $50 a share and the other $25 a share, you're going to go for the one selling for $25 (assuming equal growth rates) because you can buy $20 worth of earnings for the same amount of money. In other words, you want to grow your earnings as efficiently as possible.

**3. Hold on to companies for the long run and compound your money**

To maximize days held you must hold onto your shares for as long as possible. The logic behind this is simple: Each day you hold on to a stock, the more money you make. If you hold a stock for a year, you make 100% of its owner’s earnings for that year for every share you owned. If you own it for 6 months you get 50% of its earnings. The longer you hold onto a stock, the more earnings you accumulate, and the more your money compounds.

# Bottom line

This spreadsheet is an improved, more automatic, and intuitive adaption from a solution I've been using myself and it's helped me become a more calm, collected, rational investor. Without it I would not have had as much fun finding great companies with strong earnings potential, nor would I have held onto them for as long as I have. In other words, it has made me a much more successful long-term investor and I hope it can do the same for you.

In this document I compare the results and attribute causes to discrepancies between the forecast model and actual results.

#SUMMARY

A large number of non-recurring items negatively impacted nominal earnings, but I expect the majority of these factors to mitigate by the fourth quarter. Recurring earnings were much stronger and that has been reflected in the recent analyst upgrades. The price has increased from $7.21 when the report was first announced on July 13 to $8.27 today, September 13. Earnings were announced on August 18.

Some weaknesses exist in the model for Capesize, Feeder, PCTC, and Suezmax vessels, and will need to be addressed, in addition to some neglected non-recurring items. My price target is still in place at $12/share, but the anticipated dividend increase has been postponed and may be revisited in Q3 or Q4 earnings.

#UNPREDICTABLE FACTORS

* 2M higher General & Administrative costs; non-recurring
    - Higher than expected legal fees incurred for Seadrill lawsuit. Should be reimbursed concluding restructuring.
    - Temporary increase in insurance premiums related to D&O – cause undetermined

* 1.9M impairment charge against West Taurus; non-recurring
    - Unexpected due to increased scrap rates since previous valuation in Q4 2020

* 1M higher crewing costs; recurring during COVID

* 0.8M loss on repurchase of debt; non-recurring

* Significant miss on predicted earnings for Capesize bulkers on lease to Golden Ocean. Rates were substantially below the lowest estimated rates at any point during the entire quarter.


#PREDICTABLE FACTORS (Avoidable Errors)

*~900K higher interest costs due to overlap between new bond issue and repayment of maturing notes; non-recurring, but will continue to affect Q3 and Q4.

*2.8M loss on non-designated derivatives. $100M of non-designated derivatives were not accounted for in the estimates, although designated derivatives were accounted for accurately; non-recurring.

*Overestimation of charter proceeds related to container-feeder vessels. Both vessels are currently on fixed-rate time charters until the end of 2021 and will not contribute to increased earnings until 2022. These charters are not reflected in SFL backlog.

*Overestimation of charter proceeds from tanker profit share. Tankers on lease to Frontline do not receive profit share related to fuel savings.

**The third quarter forecast will be released after the end of September. I am happy to answer questions.**","self","https://redd.it/pnmjt4"

""*Taken together, these findings suggest that the Fama-French factor B/M ratio might be a simple proxy for a more fundamental cash-flow risk factor captured by the equity duration.*"", [https://risk.edhec.edu/sites/risk/files/EDHEC\_Working\_Paper\_A\_New\_Measure\_of\_Equity\_Duration\_F.pdf](https://risk.edhec.edu/sites/risk/files/EDHEC_Working_Paper_A_New_Measure_of_Equity_Duration_F.pdf) (2011)

Though I'm assuming they mean B/P as an *inverse* proxy in this paper: ""*The pronounced negative correlation of -0.40 between equity duration and B/M matches with the approximation of (6) and the interpretation that the B/M ratio is a simple proxy for equity duration.*"" (ie. you would take the P/B and multiply by the pps change)

...but even then, IDK that JPM's equity duration is going to play out to be 1.86yrs (or even just 2x that) if 10yr interest rates where to spike 1%.","self","https://redd.it/pqc2ng"

Emperor’s foie gras
‘Most Chinese billionaires are like geese – they get fat on their political connections and close to party leaders, but at some point the Emperor decides he wants to eat foie gras’1
Introduction
China offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities of our time. The country is experiencing the fastest expansion of consumer spending power the world has ever seen, and by 2027, almost 1.2 billion Chinese will be in the middle class, making up a quarter of the world’s middle class.2 Chinese consumers have followed the path of their Western counterparts, with economic growth driving investments in home ownership, vehicle purchases, as well as stimulating demand for high quality discretionary products. At the same time though, Chinese consumers have set their own trends through rapid adoption of e-commerce and digital finance. Moreover, China is not just the ‘consumption epicentre’ of the world, it is also home to an excellent entrepreneurial culture with a vibrant stock market. There are close to 5,000 publicly listed firms in the country, which in terms of its breadth and depth is matched by only a few other nations such as the United States.
However, the history of capitalism is relatively short in China. The government still runs large parts of the economy and retains considerable influence across a wide range of industries. As investors in Emerging Market countries, crony capitalism and state influence are not foreign to us, but what makes China unique is the way state or crony influence subtly blends into the private sector. Ownership is blurred between private sector and state influenced actors, and the real shareholders are hidden to such an extent that it is often difficult to determine what is genuinely private. This vagueness is compounded by a lack of free media, as well as the absence of an independent court system and respect for private property rights, which many Western investors usually take for granted.
Fat Geese businessmen
Wu Xiaohui started out as a low-level bureaucrat in Wenzhou, a city known for its entrepreneurialism. In 1996, he got a dealership license for SAIC, a large state-owned automobile company which manufactured Volkswagen and General Motors cars in China. During this time, he also cultivated a close relationship with Zhuo Ran, the granddaughter of China’s former paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. He eventually married her and used the Deng family’s considerable political clout, to obtain licenses to sell auto-insurance and other financial services. He also forged a close relationship with Chen Xiaolu, who was a prominent princeling3, as the son of Marshal Chen Yi (one of the eight leading Generals in Mao’s revolutionary army).
By 2010, Wu’s flagship company Anbang Insurance was sufficiently large enough to bid for large prestigious property plots in major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. In 2014, Anbang bought New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel for USD 1.9 billion, which was the highest amount ever paid for a single property. In 2016, it tried to acquire Starwood Hotels (owner of Sheraton, Westin and W brands) for USD 14 billion. By 2017, Anbang emerged as one of the largest insurance companies in the country by asset size (USD 300 billion). Even with this size, its shareholder structure and the exact source of its funds was never entirely clear. Anbang’s takeover of Fidelity and Guaranty Life, an insurer operating in Iowa and New York was blocked by local regulators in 2016, as Anbang failed to provide information on its opaque shareholder structure.
The Chinese government decided to put the brakes on these big-ticket deals to acquire trophy Western assets in early 2017, and around the same time, Wu seemed to have lost political backing in Beijing. Soon, the Chinese insurance regulator stopped Anbang from selling new insurance products, and it seemed that Anbang had lost the support of large Chinese banks. The government eventually seized control of the company in early 2018 and Wu ended up with 18 years jail sentence for fraud and embezzlement.
There is a long list of such ‘fat geese’ billionaires, at the top of China’s corporate food chain; Chen Feng (HNA group, linked to Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping’s trusted aide), Wang Jianlin (Dalian Wanda group, linked to Xi Jinping’s sister), Xiao Jianhua (Tomorrow Holdings, close to Jiang Zemin, China’s supreme leader from 1989-2002), Guo Guangchang (Fosun International, close ties with Ling Jinhua, a former top aide of Hu Jintao, President of China from 2003-2013), and Jack Ma (Alibaba, closely linked to the Shanghai faction of the Party, chronicled in our Winter 2020 investor letter).
While the prominent ‘fat geese’ billionaires are well documented by media, information on smaller corrupt and politically connected businessmen is not as readily available. Yet, the culture of cronyism, corruption and favouritism goes all the way down to small/mid-size companies. Many prominent private equity funds in the country are populated with princelings who help the investee companies win government favours through their connections. For example, a major medical diagnostics chain we evaluated for a potential investment had multiple minority investors in various labs they ran across the country; and most of these minority investors were relatives of locally influential party officials. This chain also had an equity investment from a powerful national conglomerate controlled by one of the ‘fat geese’ billionaire, which helped them with appropriate connections in Beijing.
“What is wrong with backing these ‘fat geese’ businessmen?”, you might ask. Being connected to the right people in power, could even be the most important short-term competitive advantage in a place like China. The problem for a long-term investor is that if we buy shares in this medical diagnostic chain, how do we know whether their success is linked to the way they run their operations, or to their links with local party bosses? What if those local party bosses lose power? If we do not even know what makes them successful, how can then we be sure about the resilience of the business, or how can we value the company for the long-term?
More importantly, expropriation is a risk always present in those Emerging Markets that have fragile institutions and low respect for property rights. If a business is built on cronyism and political connections, it is much easier for governments (and political opponents) to bend circumstances to their objectives and go after these businesses. That said, investing alongside corrupt businessmen is not the only way to invite the Emperor’s wrath; the other way is to back companies which lack social purpose.
Profit at all costs
The market for private tuition in China grew at 11% CAGR between 2015-2020, with leading players such as New Oriental (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) experiencing 25-30% top line growth during this period. These companies appeared to have fantastic business models, earning high gross profit margins (55-60%) and high returns on equity (30%+), with their shares very highly rated (PEs of 60x). For someone analysing these companies with the lens of a traditional investment analyst, these were great compounding-type businesses to be held for the long-term.
But were these companies serving a social purpose? Were they solving a problem for the community around them or creating a problem themselves? The fantastic profit margins they reported were perhaps the other side of the significant costs they imposed on the parents and students, which went unaccounted for in traditional financial models.
In China, millions of students compete every year for just a few thousand seats in prestigious top colleges. This success is based on a single entrance exam, meaning parents and students are naturally very anxious to do their best preparing for this exam. After-school private tuition companies, through aggressive marketing, succeeded in turning this anxiety into a nationwide ‘Fear of Missing Out’, where parents felt compelled to enrol their children to their programs, even though they could barely afford the fees. As per some estimates, Chinese urban households spend close to 25% of their income on private education services4; and almost 75% of children in urban China are enrolled into private tutoring of some kind. There is very little evidence that these courses raised the education level for children, as they are often run by mediocre tutors and focused on making students cram for exams. These companies not only raised the cost of parenting for everyone in urban China, without any material benefit; they also imposed more pressure on an entire generation of Chinese children.
In this context, it should not come as a surprise that the Chinese government decided to act against the entire sector. Companies that pursue profit at the expense of the local community risk losing their social licence to operate. When they do, the results are disastrous for the business and shareholder returns. Especially in an autocratic state such as China, the rulers are extra sensitive to any potential criticism from powerful interest groups such as the urban middle class. Serving a social purpose and creating goodwill in the local community becomes critical to the long-term survival of the business.
Aikya’s Investment Approach
China usually evokes extreme behaviour from investors. One set of investors, who are overly focused on near term financial metrics, tend to ignore some of the risks highlighted above and are happy to buy Chinese companies regardless of who owns them or whether they serve a social purpose. Another set of investors usually get put off by governance risks, a general lack of Western-style institutions, and the lack of easy access to trustworthy information; they simply stay away from investing in the country.
We believe that a more nuanced approach is needed. The team at Aikya has spent the last 20 years researching China and have collectively analysed close to 1,000 Chinese companies. We are highly sensitive to some of the risks highlighted above and therefore very selective in the companies we choose to back. We have rejected almost 97 companies out of every 100 companies that we have analysed in China. But we equally appreciate the entrepreneurialism and breadth of the market and hence have been able to select 26 Chinese companies to our investable Quality List. These 26 companies are run by some of the best stewards of capital in the world and are well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented consumption growth China is currently undergoing.
So, what type of companies do we like?
We like companies with strong principal owners. These are the people with ‘soul-in-the-game’ who are emotionally invested in their companies. A permanent owner-mindset enables these entrepreneurs to make decisions which are likely to strengthen the business in the long-run, without falling for either short termism or not caring about returns on capital at all, which is so common with companies with state-owned or ownerless corporations.
We avoid ‘fat geese’ businessmen. Our starting point is to understand the original source of wealth of the entrepreneur or business family that we are investigating alongside. How did they get their initial success? Is it a clean story, or did they need the help of government or politicians at any point? We always explore the inner mechanisms of a business model to try to understand if there is any government influence either through positive regulations or favourable operating licenses. We then assess if these regulations are transparent and fair, or if they favour a certain set of players?
We usually avoid companies where the government or government-owned entities are the primary customers and look at how much of the goods and services produced by a business are directly sold to the government, or at least sold through a government tender. Because of these reasons, we have hardly any companies on our Quality List which operate in Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Telecom, Materials and Energy sectors in China, as these sectors see high levels of government involvement.
In a country, where media is not free and information is not easy to obtain, uncovering political linkages and the real shareholder structures of small relatively less known Chinese companies is not easy. It requires patient due diligence, a contextual understanding of how things work in China, and a strong set of trusted relationships on the ground.
All the companies on Aikya’s Quality List display high levels of social stewardship, which essentially means they pay fair taxes, do not cut corners in the way they treat employees, and generally behave well towards the community they operate within. Such exemplary behaviour gives little opportunity for politicians to start interfering with a business.
Our purpose is to generate healthy long-term returns with strong downside protection. Years of experience investing in Emerging Markets have taught us that ensuring ‘return of capital’ is almost as important as pursuing ‘return on capital’. As a result, our investment approach has evolved to mitigate the risks which could result in our investee companies ending up as Emperor’s foie gras.","self","https://redd.it/q2dvk8"

**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.

So here are the four easy charts:

​

1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.  

2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!
3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.
4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.

**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.

​

**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.","self","https://redd.it/q33ud5"

I'm constantly looking for new ways to improve my methods, so anything you have to say is highly valued and appreciated!

I initially found PRDO while using one of my favorite value screeners. I searched for companies trading within 25% of their 52 week lows with a market cap below $5b, debt-to-equity below 30%, return-on-equity over 20%, and return-on-total-capital above 10%. I primarily look for small-caps because they’re often overlooked (especially when monetary policy is loose). It’s my hope that companies trading off these lows, while still remaining highly profitable and having little-to-no debt, have been mispriced by the market. As long as everything under the hood is okay, these companies are potential opportunities. 

Perdoceo Education Corporation is a for-profit post-secondary education provider with both online and offline learning opportunities. In 2020, \~95% of students were enrolled online. They offer various degrees and certificates, including associates degrees, bachelors degrees, and doctoral degrees, as well as an array of certificates for career focused disciplines. Perdoceo owns and operates American Intercontinental University, Colorado Technical University, and Trident University International.

Here’s why it’s sold off so much. In 2020 Perdoceo, as a whole, received 74% of its tuition from Title IV federal funding. The 90-10 rule, a US regulation, stipulates a for-profit school’s revenue cannot be more than 90% federally funded and the remaining 10% must be found elsewhere. However, in 2019 the US Department of Education allowed Perdoceo to differ $39 million of federal funding to avoid violating the 90-10 rule, so long as they entered a 2-year probationary period. If Perdoceo violates the regulation again, federal funding will be terminated. Additionally, an amendment was recently passed that closes a loophole allowing the money veterans use under the GI Bill and Pentagon tuition assistance programs to be excluded from the 90% of the 90-10 rule. Even though the closure of this loophole may seem scary, I’m not very concerned because Perdoceo has the means to adjust their ratio by the time it takes effect in 2023. However, it is still important to be aware that **Perdoceo is highly dependent on Title IV funding** and would have to liquidate if it dries up.

As per their 2020 annual report, Perdoceo was sitting on $406,360,000 in cash and marketable securities (\~$300,000,000 in municipal bonds and non-governmental debt securities) and $52,000,000 in debt. This was likely accumulated in response to the over $500,000,000 in settlement funds Perdoceo has paid out over the last couple of years related to lawsuits for their unethical practices of student recruiting. However, I have total confidence management will effectively use this money to facilitate any changes needed to stay within the 90-10 limits, as they seem focused on improving transparency in their marketing methods. It also doesn’t hurt that these assets are generating interest while they sit on the balance sheet.

In a broad sense, I also believe the online schooling trend will continue far into the future, as COVID helped a previously untapped market realize its convenience and simplicity over traditional education options. So now that we have all of that out of the way, let’s get into the numbers!

I like to use the discounted cashflow model for my intrinsic valuations because I believe it’s the most effective and objective way to value a business. For this valuation I’ll be using the financial information from Perdoceo’s 2020 annual report, but will update the model in another article with their 2021 numbers when they come out next quarter.

Please keep in mind that most of the assumptions used to perform the calculations in this model are extremely conservative and are intended to represent the worst-case scenarios possible (aside from liquidation) in an effort to build-in an additional margin of safety on top of the 30% I require for my results. To calculate my discount rate I used a risk-free rate of 1.534% to determine Perdoceo’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which came out around 8%. For the purposes of this valuation, I will round up and use a discount rate of 10%.

For all my discounted cash flow valuations I extrapolate revenue and determine what the company’s free-cashflow-to-equity margin is using historical data. This obviously only works if I can accurately predict what their future margins will be, so I tend to be more conservative when doing this. In my mind, the more conservative one is, the higher their margin of safety will be. In 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 Perdoceo’s free-cashflow-to-revenue was -4.71%, 8.65%, 10.82%, and 24.76% respectively. Clearly, they have been becoming more profitable over time, but I will be using a ratio of 10% to stay extra conservative and make sure I have considerable room for error.

After projecting future cash flows, terminal value, and subtracting the company’s net debt, I arrived with three intrinsic values for three different scenarios. The first assumes a 0% growth rate for the next five years with a 0% perpetual growth rate, the second assumes an annual decline in revenue of 5% over the next five years with a perpetual growth rate of 0%, and the third assumes an annual decline in revenue of 10% over the next five years with a perpetual growth rate of 0%, all with free cashflow margins and discount rates of 10%. These three scenarios were weighted with probabilities of 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively.

Scenario 1: $18.52

Scenario 2: $15.81

Scenario 3: $13.58

Weighted average: $16.72

As you can see, even with very conservative assumptions, Perdoceo remains significantly undervalued compared to its previous closing price of $11.07. With a margin of safety of 30%, it’s a buy up to $11.70 (and that’s assuming stagnant or negative revenue growth and compressed cashflow margins over the next few years). Hopefully, the risks priced into the market are overblown and Perdoceo can continue its operations without any hindrances. The recent increase in hedge fund and institutional ownership (currently at 7.56% and 81.04% of outstanding shares) may indicate this sentiment, but only time will tell.

Thank you for taking the time to read this valuation! Please share any questions, constructive criticisms, or comments you may have. If you'd like the formulas and financial data I used to calculate WACC, FCFE, or DCF, they can be provided upon request.

**Note: I do not think this company is ethical by any means. Their historically predatory student recruitment is gross and this is not a company I want to own long-term. For that reason, I'll be exiting my position when the intrinsic share value is realized by the market (if at all).**","self","https://redd.it/q39u0q"

Best to stick to firm's accounts value for provisions under liability (if number is reasonable/believable)? Any good heuristics you've found for improving/adjusting fair value of these sorts of costs?

&#x200B;

From footnotes analyst:

*""Pension, environmental and other non-financial liabilities are all measured in the balance sheet at a current value. However, the discount rate used in that measurement is somewhat varied and, in particular, may not reflect the credit risk of the entity. Unfortunately, no fair value disclosures are required.*

*These debt-like liabilities can be large for some companies and we think that investors may overlook the importance of how these are valued. You should compare the discount rate applied to the yield on the company’s debt that has characteristics similar to the liability and adjust for any difference, taking into account the liability duration.""*

I have been for 30+ years.  More recently, I've been investing in pre-IPO startups.

In all of these cases, I've been able to assign a value of what I think a particular security is worth, or could be worth, using traditional means:  estimate future cash flows, discount to present value, etc.

I had the opportunity to buy a particular cryptocurrency before it started trading on the open market.  (Kind of a pre-ipo cryptocurrency.)  I am wondering what it will be worth once it starts trading.  My best guess encompasses a range from $0.10 to $2.00  (I bought it for $0.02).  It should start trading next week.

The ""security analysis"" process that people seem to follow  is to rank all the different cryptocurrencies based on how useful they are or something like that.  Then compare it to the ""market cap"" of a similar ranking cryptocurrency.

They define the ""market cap"" as the total number of cryptocurrency coins available times the price per coin. For instance, right now the #50 ranked coin is something called Kusama (KSM) and it has a market cap of $3.3 billion.  

One problem with this analysis is that some of these coins have built in dilution.  They may have 1 million available right now, but in 5 years it will be 10 million.  I don't think people take this into account.

Due to the ongoing increases in cargo vessel charter rates during 2021, it is my belief that SFL is significantly undervalued relative to its current price, and will continue to outperform analyst expectations in Q3 2021. My model indicates they will achieve earnings of $0.28/share on a recurring basis which is a moderate increase over last quarter, but without the deluge of impairments and one-time expenses they saw during Q2. It is my belief that an increase in the dividend will drive the price over $10/share following their Q3 earnings announcement. My target price of $12/share, to be realized between the announcement of Q3 2021 earnings and Q1 2022.

##**Summary of Estimates**

Total charter hire of $151.4M in Q3 vs $141.5M in Q2.

Recurring earnings of $36.0M (~$0.28) in Q2 vs $29.0M (~$0.23/share) in Q2.

Non-cash/non-recurring earnings of $2.2M in Q3 vs $-9.5M in Q2.

Total combined earnings of $38.2M (~$0.30/share) in Q3 vs $19.5M (~$0.15.5/share) in Q2.

**Liners**

Q3 estimated hire of $78.1M vs $75.3M in Q2
Inclusive of $2.5M estimated Q3 profit share vs $2.4M in Q2

Increase attributable to more days in the quarter and delivery of 5 new container ships during the quarter.
Increase partially offset by sale of container feeder vessels.
Increased profit share due to expanding scrubber fuel spread.

**Bulkers**

Q3 estimated hire $46.4M vs $39.4M in Q2
Majority of charter hire coming from ships operating in the spot markets.

Increase attributable to 7 handysize bulkers and 3 supramax bulkers trading in the spot market, and 8 capesize bulkers on time charters with profit share. One additional supramax was added late in the quarter and may have a small effect.

Increase offset by estimated higher fuel and crewing costs during the quarter.

**Tankers**

Q3 estimated hire of $14.7M vs $14.6M in Q2
Increase attributable to more days in the quarter.

**Rigs**

Q3 estimated hire of $12.2M vs $12.2M in Q2

##**NonRecurring/NonCash Items**

**Securities**

We estimate a gain of $0.5MM on marketable securities in Q3. This is entirely driven by appreciation of 1.4M shares held in Frontline. 

SFL’s other bonds and securities are likely to have appreciated as they are oil-related, but are also highly illiquid and difficult to value.

**Swaps & Derivatives**

I estimate an approximate $1.2MM appreciation of non-designated derivatives. 
I estimate approximately $3MM appreciation of designated derivatives.

**Other items**

1.3MM higher interest expense related to rollover of unsecured bonds.

Slightly higher interest expense related to increase in Norwegian funds rate.

Gain on repurchase of debt and a small reduction in the credit-loss provision is likely, but not estimated.

**Ongoing Developments**

7 Handysize vessels are to be sold for $100M in Q4, with net proceeds of $50M and book gains of $40M. This will result in a decrease in quarterly earnings of roughly $10M, and is expected to take partial effect in Q4 2021 and full effect in Q1 2022.

3 Suezmax tankers are to be acquired in Q4 2021, along with 5-year fixed-rate charters. They are expected to contribute ~$7MM in gross charter hire per quarter.

Seadrill has had it’s proposed reorganization plan approved by the secured debt holders and bankruptcy court. It is expected to complete reorganization in Q4 2021. It is expected that SFL will receive a one-time payment related to reimbursable legal fees, and an increase in ongoing charter rates related to its two offshore oil rigs. This will contribute roughly 1.5MM to quarterly earnings assuming the lease for the West Linus remains unmodified.

SFL repaid a $225M bond due October 15, 2021. The convertible bonds were issued at $225M and an interest rate of 5.75%. The issuance of the $150M @7.25% bond in Q2 and repayment of the @225M @5.75% bond will reduce interest expense moving forward by $0.5M/quarter relative to Q1 2021.

SFL continues to benefit from dramatic increases in charter rates for Capesize and Supramax vessels this quarter. With the 5 new container vessels taking full effect in Q4, we expect to see another substantial step up in recurring earnings, depending upon the exact sale date of the handysize vessels.

**Abstract** 

Systemic risk in the banking sector is usually associated with long periods of economic downturn and very large social costs. On one hand, shocks coming from correlated exposures towards the real economy may induce correlation in banks’ default probabilities thereby increasing the likelihood for systemic-tail events like the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. On the other hand, financial contagion also plays an important role in generating large-scale market failures, amplifying the initial shocks coming from the real economy. To study the sources of these rare phenomena, we propose a new definition of systemic risk (i.e. the probability of a large number of banks going into distress simultaneously) and thus we develop a multilayer microstructural model to study empirically the determinants of systemic risk. The model is then calibrated on the most comprehensive granular dataset for the euro area banking sector, capturing roughly 96% or EUR 23.2 trillion of euro area banks’ total assets over the period 2014-2018. The output of the model decompose and quantify the sources of systemic risk showing that correlated economic shocks, financial contagion mechanisms, and their interaction are the main sources of systemic events. The results obtained with the simulation engine resemble common market-based systemic risk indicators and empirically corroborate findings from existing literature. This framework gives regulators and central bankers a tool to study systemic risk and its developments, pointing out that systemic events and banks’ idiosyncratic defaults have different drivers, hence implying different policy responses.","self","https://redd.it/rdrx01"

Today I will be covering Petroteq, a clean oil technology company I discovered about a month ago.

**Thesis**

I am bullish on Petroteq under the assumptions that a) the unsolicited hostile takeover for the company is legitimate and serious and b) the technology is legitimate after receiving third-party validation for its commercial viability from an engineering firm.

**Summary**

In short, Petroteq is a company that has been developing its patented CORT (clean oil recovery technology) for over a decade in an effort to cleanly harvest oil sands. Today, oil sands are viewed as prohibitively expensive and excessively damaging today and thus there is little interest in them. According to Petroteq, CORT functions as a closed-loop extraction system that importantly uses no water, thus producing no tailing ponds, recycles solvent, and interestingly yields sand as a byproduct that can be sold, cutting into the company's operating expenses. 

I will dive into the sequence of events that lead me to be interested in the company later, but after many reports and much work, the company has determined its cost of production will be financially competitive with other sources of oil extraction today, costing \~$22 per barrel, not counting the sand-sale offset, and that the oil produced from their process can be sold for prices at a marginal discount to WTI prices according to the company's ex-COO.

**Background of Events**

Petroteq has been working on its technology for over decade and in that time has repeatedly diluted shareholders or sold convertible debentures to fund its research. This paints a very ugly historical picture of the company and instantly casts doubt and suspicion over it. You may notice the company is also halted on the TSX; this is a product of these converts. Essentially, Petroteq failed to report on many of these and had to play catch up, only recently submitting information regarding these converts to the exchange in an effort towards reinstatement.

Collectively, these would have led me to ignore the company but two developments (and these developments exclusively) have piqued my interest: first, the company has a tender offer in place for all of its outstanding shares, and second, a third-party firm has validated the company's technology.

***Tender Offer***

On April 16th, 2021, a Swedish consulting firm Uppgard Konsult, representing a private buyer, published in a German Gazette that its buyer sought to purchase all shares from German shareholder's for €0.48/share. Simplifying somewhat, Petroteq was surprised/curious due to the strange nature of the offer and attempted to contact Uppgard to learn more about it and who Uppgard was representing.

These efforts culminated in a signed confidentiality agreement between the parties and a conversation. On Sep. 29th, 2021, it was revealed that Uppgard was representing Viston United Swiss AG, a shell company owned wholly by a man named Zbigniew Roch. Research shows that Mr. Roch is the head of the European Business Club and is associated with the ex-PM of Poland, Donald Tusk.

Viston indicated that the tender offer available to German shareholders would soon be available to shareholders in the USA and Canada under the same terms at an exchange-rate adjusted price. Petroteq requested more information about Viston and those behind it after receiving a letter indicating Viston was considering a potential friendly corporate transaction to acquire all the shares of Petroteq. Viston did not send the information requested and instead through its lawyer requested a letter from Petroteq listing all its shareholders which was soon followed by an unsolicited attempted hostile takeover of the company via a tender offer to acquire >50% of all shares by February 7th, 2022, accompanied by demonstration of the funds required to buy the shares (>$469Mn).

In response, Petroteq has hired Haywood Securities, an investment bank, to evaluate Petroteq and give the company and its shareholders a clearer picture of Petroteq’s value as they felt the unsolicited offer has pressured Petroteq shareholders into an unfair deal. I personally feel this valuation is meaningless, with the only positive being that Haywood may find another interested buyer that could submit bid for the company to make the buyout competetive.

Now, shareholders are sitting on their hands waiting for Haywood’s report and to hear what Petroteq’s board suggests its shareholders do with regards to the Viston offer. Viston itself has been silent since submitting their offer.

Lending credence to this entire transaction are the companies representing the offerer. In Canada, Viston is using Gowling WLG LLP, the premier M&A legal firm, while in the USA it is using Dorsey & Whitney LLP, very reputable in its own right. A informational agent, Viston has contracted Kingsdale Advisors. 

***FEED Validation***

For years Petroteq has waxed poetic about its revolutionary technology and they understandably gave very little reason for its shareholders to believe them. This has changed recently.

Petroteq contracted a Canadian engineering firm, Chapman Engineering, to design them a FEED report on their technology, essentially designing a plant with commercial viability. Far more interesting is that on August 1st, 2021, this technology was validated by another, third-party engineering firm, Kahuna Ventures LLC.

\-

So, in mere months the company has gone from an un-reputable, diluting POS, to a company with technology having third-party validation and an offer on the table.

**Risks, Mitigants, and Concerns**

Long term, this entire thesis is built around the tender offer happening. Some investors have faith in the technology with current management as custodians, but I am not so optimistic. Additionally, in the past few months the company has lost its founder and previous CEO as well as its COO. Kind of a ""read the writing on the wall"" situation IMO.

There are two major obstacles to the tender offer failing:

 ***1) the offer from Viston is illegitimate or not serious and for whatever reason, they may decide to rescind the offer, upon which the share price of Petroteq would collapse.***

There is a chance that this offer was never meant to be serious and instead was used to jack up the share price and in the future will be rescinded. 

Insubstantive evidence supports this claim, but with such a premium over the share's then price and even higher premium to the share price today, it appears the market is pessimistic about this deal going through. However, the market isn't always right.

Interestingly, Bellridge Capital, with Robert Klimov as MP (Eastern European last name?) bought into Petroteq right around the same time the preliminary Uppgard offer became public. They rode the increase in price and just recently sold 11Mn of their 41Mn shares for a substantial profit. It is unknown what they have done with the remaining 30Mn shares as their ownership falls under the reporting threshold. This will be discussed and repeated later.

***2) <50%+1 shareholders tender their shares and Viston’s offer fails.***

Petroteq’s largest shareholders are Valkor LLC, an engineering firm and partner of Petroteq, Bellridge Capital LP, a private investment fund, Petrollo Lp Corp., and the company’s founder, Aleksandr Blyumkin. As mentioned, Bellridge liquidated a portion of their holdings going from 7.46% owners to 4.74% owners (selling 11Mn shares). It is unknown what size their position is now due their stake being smaller than the reporting threshold. The selling of their stake will be discussed below.

Outside of Bellridge, the other major shareholders account for 21.55% of all outstanding shares and it appears that they are all interested in running Petroteq themselves due to their hesitancy towards advising shareholders to tender and take a 279% gain. This is important to consider as this small group can sway the direction of the tender’s success.

With Bellridge’s sale, it is possible that the fund sold a portion of their position to lock in some profit in the event the deal does not go through. Their cost basis was far lower than $0.18/share (where they sold). However, it is hard to rationalize this sale as if the deal goes through, they’d have left at least \~$4.6Mn on the table. Take this how you wish.

***Hedge Fund Manipulation***

Right now, the stock looks very ugly. Aside from smarter money knowing something we don't, I suspect the reason for the depressed price is that those holding the numerous converts that Petroteq has issued are selling shares short for risk-free arbitrage. Some say that is a bullish signal, I am not sure how I feel about it. They aren't taking any risk and have cashed out instead of hold debt implying they don't expect to be paid off, but they are at least waiting around to see if there is any potential pay-off. This has contributed to substantial downward pressure.

Currently, the stock hovers around 30% short float. I admit, I don't fully understand this arbitrage play, but many of these converts were issued ages ago so AFAIK the shares had to have been shorted when the converts were issued/bought, leaving the recent fast and substantial depression in price unexplained. Please, correct me if I am wrong here.

**Catalyst**

The catalyst is already in motion as, like the thesis, it centers around the tender offer going through. At this point, all shareholders can do is follow news that comes out between now and Feb 7th, 2022, and to tender their shares if or when they decide that shareholder value will be maximized upon the sale of Petroteq to Viston.

I am open for questions. Even with all of this information, I am still not certain about what will happen here. This is a very unique situation and I would love to hear input on past experiences that are similar to this or explanations for things I may see as downsides that are actually upsides, etc.

Frankly, I am looking for discussions from serious investors. Stocktwits and the company's personal subreddit are of little help and it's tough to find anything but the most enthusiastic of bulls in both. However, if you contribute nothing to the subreddit and are an armchair critic who relishes in condescension, please find another post. I've posted on this subreddit before and people who offer nothing of substance instead choose to be pedantic while really offering no contrarian evidence or reasoning.","self","https://redd.it/ret986"

VISA in particular was almost spot on within the coming year. I haven't done it since because it took forever and i didn't set up the workbook in a way that could be used multiple times.

At my job my boss has us make Profit and Loss statements using these huge reports from SAP. Five different reports; Salary, Spending reports that show revenue, expenses, etc. 

For the most part, its just a matter of SUMIFS functions based on the GL, Spending area, and year. The workbook is set up in a way that the report can be downloaded and then pasted over where the data automatically updates with littel trouble.

Based on this, the same could be done for a data driven analysis, no?

If i get all my Statements from the same source( Market watch, WSJ, Yahoo, etc.) then i could, in theory, do the same thing with SUMIFS,and such.

The part that confused me last time i tried was which FCF i should be using? Theres FCF to firm, FCF to equity, and then a quick and easy FCF that comes from the cash flow statement. 

I'm wondering if this would be worth the time and trouble, or if there is a better method than DCF? I do remember learning about Adjusted Present Value as a method as well. We learned DDM, DCF, APV, ratio analysis, and a few others in school, but DCF was treated as the ""golden method"".

Also wondering what problems one might encounter in doing such a workbook...

A quick google search shows that there are a few of these ""automated analysis"" books available to download, so it might be worth checking them out first.

Any thoughts from you guys?

The idea that i could just dump the data in and change variables like WACC, and such as needed would be a game changer for my own analysis!","self","https://redd.it/rf5sa0"

I recently came across SMMT in my screening. So this has been a fun holiday dd for me.

First, the macro. Biotech (except for vaccine makers) has been red, sometimes deeply, for 2021. Mean reversal in sentiment is bound to happen in the future.

Second, the company itself is a ""*Cambridge, Massachusetts-based medicinal therapies company that IPO’d in the U.S. in 2015. The company was originally domiciled in the United Kingdom but decided to relocate to the United States in 2020 due to perceived strategic advantages like access to capital. As such, the original American Depositary Shares were exchanged for new Summit common stock. The company is levering its proprietary Discuva Platform for drug development. The platform is intended to expand the company’s leadership position in the research and development of new mechanism antibiotics by identifying novel targets, determining the mechanism of action, and helping to optimize against bacterial resistance.*

*To enable the platform, the scientist at Summit have created libraries of mutant bacteria, which enable control over bacterial gene expression, and when combined with next-generation sequencing, can identify which genes are essential for a bacterium’s survival. The company’s pipeline is solely focused on the development of Ridinilazole, which is in late-stage development for C. difficile infection.""*

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4436076-summit-therapeutics-a-full-investment-analysis-of-this-antibiotic-innovator-smmt](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4436076-summit-therapeutics-a-full-investment-analysis-of-this-antibiotic-innovator-smmt)

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476570-summit-therapeutics-disappointing-but-not-outright-failure](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476570-summit-therapeutics-disappointing-but-not-outright-failure)

The stock recently corrected 50%+ after publishing the report of its Stage 3 clinical trial result for Ridinilazole. Please see the announcement result on SMMT website.  There is currently no other drug on the pipeline, so that makes SMMT a single-drug play.

**Looking at insider activity**, Duggan Robert (CEO, own 75% of the company) is an experienced player in biotech who have had both successes and failures. I view this as a positive since many times start-up biotech fails for lack of institutional experience and funding. As stated below, Duggan Robert seems determined to keep funding the company.

""**Update Regarding Corporate Funding Initiatives**

The Company is also announcing that it anticipates commencing a rights offering to be available to all holders of record of the Company’s common stock in January 2022. It is anticipated that the record date for the distribution of rights to all holders of Common Stock will be in mid-January, at a date to be announced, with share price, gross proceeds, timing, and other terms also anticipated to be announced in January. Mr. Duggan, who is the beneficial shareholder of approximately 71% of our outstanding common stock prior to this rights offering in addition to his executive leadership responsibilities, has indicated that he intends to participate in the rights offering and subscribe for the full amount of his basic subscription rights, but has not made any formal binding commitment to do so.

The Company intends to register the rights offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by filing a prospectus supplement to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. When available, a copy of the prospectus supplement may be obtained at the website maintained by the SEC at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4Y81gjW-YMlaoxv2fEmLd2oYV7adVKfnVFnild7UvLUxC_MXPOgbP77DCvQlBZGrU6irOgAzQOH0IgPlrLPezw==).""

Extra funding will come in a rights offering in mid-January. If Duggan Robert fully participates, it will be an injection of about $100-200mm in cash, putting insolvency issues out of the picture for a while.

**Researching antibiotics has been a capital intensive venture with little profitability.** There are interesting articles about the ""superbug"" risk in the medical science community. I'd recommend people reading it to educate themselves more about the issues. In short, the nature of antibiotics is that it should be used with restraint, as little as possible to avoid the development of bacteria resistant to the drugs. This fly in the face of the current pay structure for drugs where volume of use is important to profitability. The Pasteur Act being considered in the U.S. is seeking to alleviate this issue: the government will pay for the development of antibiotics.

Overall, I view SMMT's effort to be praise-worthy. The economics feasibility of its product hinge on (a) the passage of laws like the Pasteur Act and (b) what management will do with the funding round in January.

I think the set-up is decent both in macro and micro for a start-up biotech play. So I have opened a long position in SMMT common equity. I intend to fully participate in the rights offering mid-January. The shares have rallied about 20% since I bought my position, so caveat emptor.

Disclaimer: I don’t have a position on this name yet.

For those that don’t know it, JBGS is a REIT focused on the greater Washington DC area. This is a company that was born as a spin off from VORNADO (another REIT) back in 2017. It’s a small company ($3 bn mkt. cap. / $bn enterprise value), with virtually no analyst coverage – but poised perhaps on the ledge of significant NOI growth. Lets dicuss!!

The bad: 

* Since inception the Company has historically underperformed, both in the stock market as well as in terms of its operating metrics – which are relatively flat on a unitary basis vs. a few years ago.
* Part of the share underperformance has been that the company is predominantly focused on Office/Retail real estate and part that a lot of the CFs have been reinvested in long-tail ventures that have yet to translate into material NAV accretion.
* Only 2 analysts cover the name, so there is not a lot of attention from the Street here. 
   * **BMO just started coverage a few months ago, so if anyone could share the Initiation of Coverage report, that would be helpful in the analysis.**

The good:

* The majority of assets owned by JBGS are in the National Landing area, which is where Amazon is developing HQ2 in Washington DC.
* JBGS is a respected player in the Wash. DC real estate game with a significant track record and a good management team. In fact, they were chosen by Amazon as their exclusive development partner for HQ2. 
* Given the AMZN relationship and the big asset base in National Landing, JBG should benefit from both a significant development pipeline in the area (they own >70% of unencumbered development rights in the area) as well as overall rent growth there. MG is very active and is working on many projects in lease-up, construction and pipeline.
* The company is in the midst of a change of focus: they are currently predominantly office-focused, but have espoused an orientation of transitioning towards residential. They have publicly communicated plans to sell >$1.5bn of non-core assets and reinvest them both in multifamily and National Landing development. 
   * Capital reciclying won’t necessarily be the sole source of growth. They have very little leverage (\~33% of NAV), which could definitely be higher.
   * The stock has a price that optically seems not onerous / could support a floor to the valuation: cap. The current in place NOI ($324mm annual run rate) equals a cap. rate higher than 5.4%. T
   * his appears to be OK pricing for DC when one takes into account all the non-prime office they own, but it also excludes new projects and NOI growth venues. 
   * That is, it would seem we are paying a low price for the in place assets and getting a potential upside without much price risk.

Unsure on speed of execution and how much / how soon the NOI will grow, but the projects coming online in the next 1-2 years alone represent at least 11% NOI upside. NOI upside is likely higher when taking a look at the mid-term. Between this and the potential for cap. rate compression, as the REIT shifts increasingly towards MF and prime office, as opposed to old office, we could be looking at least at a mid teens IRR case over the next 2-3 years. All this while getting paid a >3% yield to wait.

* This reminds me somewhat of the BSR REAL ESTATE (HOM.U / BSRTF) case, where you had a small market cap. company that is unfollowed execute an ""overhaul"" of their portfolio assets in a relatively short time span. If you take a look at the BSRTF stock chart you will get an appreciation of how the market perceived the changes.  

&#x200B;

The risks are that they are unable to execute the capital recycling with celerity and that the market does not give them credit (multiple-wise) for the shift in the asset base towards lower cap. rate assets.
