"22yo investing $250/month – thoughts on NDQ/IVV/A200 split? Hi everyone,  
I’m 22 and investing long term with the goal of early retirement (ideally 50-60).

Current monthly investment: **$250** (will increase after car is paid off ).

**ETF allocation:**  
• **50% NDQ** – growth / U.S. tech  
• **30% IVV (S&P 500)** – broad U.S. market  
• **20% A200** – Australian market + dividends/franking

**Super:** Aware Super (High Growth)

Strategy is simple DCA, no trading, no leverage.

Looking for thoughts on diversification, overlap, and whether this is reasonable for my age and goals/recommendations.

Thanks!"
"20 y/o portfolio check - VOO / SMH / BTC (60/25/15) Hey everyone, looking for some feedback on my current setup. I’m 20, and have a 20-30 year horizon. I’m planning to DCA $800 every week and set and forget

Current target allocation is:

* 60% VOO
* 25% SMH
* 15% BTC

My logic is that VOO is the safe-ish core, but I want to be overweight on chips (SMH) because I don’t see that sector slowing down anytime soon. The 15% BTC is for the asymmetric upside.

I know VOO already has a lot of tech overlap, so I'm basically betting the house on US tech and innovation. Is 15% in BTC too aggressive for a ""passive"" portfolio? Will I regret not having international (VXUS) or broader market exposure?

Curious if anyone else is running something similar or if I’m being an idiot by concentrating this much. Appreciate any thoughts."
AVDV How do I treat AVDV in a VTI+VXUS portfolio? Should I keep it small at 5-10% or make it half of my international holdings or even use a different international ETF instead of VXUS? Currently considering something like 70/20/10 vti vxus avdv. But I'm also considering splitting my international holdings in half with vxus and avdv 15/15 or 10/10.
"Does it make sense to invest the FTSE all World and the S&P500 etf at the same time? I‘m putting money monthly into both etfs at the moment and wanted to ask if it makes sense?
I know the all world already got a big US percentage but I‘m feeling like the US company are probably are really good bet to keep growing throughout the years.
I wanna invest and keep these etfs for the next 20-30 years.
Thanks for any help or insights"
"Portfolio feedback – Non-US investor using Irish-domiciled ETFs (withholding & estate tax reasons) Non-US investor portfolio – UCITS ETFs for tax efficiency

"Tested 2 portfolio variants against SPY since 2011 - thoughts? Hey all

Been lurking here for a bit, pretty new to posting. I see a lot of the same portfolios come up (VT, 60/40, bogleheads three-fund etc) which makes sense, they're solid. But I like messing around with backtests so I put together two variants and figured I'd share.

**Portfolio 1 (diversified with defensive stuff):**

* VOO 20% / GLD 20% / XLP 20% / XLV 20% / SMH 20%

**Portfolio 2 (simpler, more aggressive):**

* VOO 45% / SMH 30% / GLD 25%

For those unfamiliar:

* XLP = Consumer Staples (Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Costco type stuff)
* XLV = Healthcare (JNJ, UnitedHealth, Pfizer)
* SMH = Semiconductors (Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom)

**Few things:**

* Data starts 2011 because of VOO
* Quarterly rebalancing
* Volatility on both is actually lower than SPY

Results are in the screenshot. Portfolio 2 has better returns but Portfolio 1 ended up with the best sharpe ratio and lowest drawdown (-24% vs SPY's -33%). Both beat the benchmark on pretty much every metric.

Anyway not trying to tell anyone to do anything, just wanted to share and see what people think. Curious how others here approach portfolio construction when they want something beyond the standard stuff

"Is Snowball Analytics good for tracking etf dividends with my voo schd split I've been all in voo for 4 years and it's been great but getting to the point where I want more dividend income, not retiring soon but I like the idea of building cash flow as a backup

I did some research and decided to shift 30% to schd keeping 70% voo, execution was easy but now I'm trying to figure out if this actually improves dividend income without sacrificing too much growth

Vanguard's site is terrible for dividend tracking, it just shows payments but doesn't forecast or break down which holdings contribute what, I need to see if the 30% schd allocation makes a real difference or if I should go back to 100% voo

I looked at snowball analytics briefly but it seemed more focused on dividend growth investors tracking individual stocks, not really set up for someone mostly in etfs, I could be wrong though

I started checking blossom recently which has a decent dividend calendar showing projected income from both etfs combined, and it helps me see if the schd allocation is worth it or if I'm overthinking this whole strategy

I'm really just trying to answer if 30% schd is the right split or should I go more aggressive on dividends or stick with pure growth

Is anyone running a similar voo schd split? How much difference does schd actually make for dividend income?"
Where to go from here Don’t know if I should continue with what I got here or change it up. I mostly just buy etfs and some nvidia here or there and just picked up mdln for the fun of it. Should I buy some different etfs as I know there’s is some good overlap between qqqm and voo?

"Best Global IT UCITS ETF (Europe - Germany) Hi there,
While looking around, I came across this subreddit and I hope someone here can help me - if this kind of post is even allowed 😅

After five years of bi-monthly recurring investments in a NASDAQ ETF, I’m looking to diversify and go more global in the IT sector. I already have a World ETF as my core holding, but I’d like to add around 10% IT exposure as a satellite in my portfolio. At the same time, as I’ve gotten a bit older, I’d like to reduce my exposure to the US with this sector gamble.. at least slightly.

So I’m looking for recommendations for global IT ETFs available in Europe, Germany.

"XRP ETF Interest Surges as Major Issuers Signal Entry Amid Broader Crypto Outflows Interest in XRP-linked ETFs has accelerated sharply, with the fledgling category logging more than 30 consecutive days of net inflows and pushing total assets toward or past the $1 billion mark since launch in mid-November. This sustained demand comes even as established crypto ETF products tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum have recorded significant outflows over the same period, highlighting a notable rotation in investor capital.

Data from SoSoValue and market trackers show that U.S. spot XRP ETFs have attracted nearly $1 billion in cumulative net inflows without a single net-outflow day, marking one of the most consistent inflow streaks in the digital asset ETF universe. In contrast, Bitcoin spot ETFs have suffered approximately $3.39 billion in outflows, while Ethereum products have seen over $1 billion exit, reflecting broader caution among investors in marquee crypto holdings. 

The surge in XRP ETF demand coincides with major asset managers preparing or filing to enter the XRP ETF market. Firms such as CoinShares and WisdomTree have signaled their intent to launch spot XRP ETF products, joining a growing lineup that includes Canary Capital’s XRPC, Franklin Templeton’s EZRP, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale’s converted GXRP fund bringing a wave of traditional financial players into the space."

"Is VT and chill or VOO/VTI and VXUS and chill as unbeatable as people hype it up to be? I know that they're valid ETFs to hold especially for people who want it to be simple, but is it really difficult to outperform the SP500 in the long term?

I was thinking why not try something like pairing SPMO with IDMO so that your holding periodically rotates to the companies gaining the most?

They seem to have beat the market so far even during downturns so I don't really see how they wouldn't in the future.

Bogle and Buffet may have had some good advice, but I'm wondering if people are just blindly parroting outdated advice from some old guys whose time have past."
"Came across $100,000. Are 100% VOO, 100% VTI, or 70% VOO & 30% VXUS good ideas? I find myself with $100,000 USD in my bank account. I've never had this much money before. I'm 30 with very minimal investments. I'd like to best use this as my first big step towards eventual financial independence (hopefully). I have about $10,000 left in student debt (interest free). No other debt. I have a mid 700 credit score.

I commonly see 3 similar investment methods that are recommended.

1. 100% VOO. Something about Jack Bogle saying US. stock are international because those companies operate internally.

2. VTI one and done. I believe 15% international exposure.

3. VOO and VXUS so you can rebalance if seen necessary.

Far be it from me to believe I could determine a more optimized ""split"" than is offered in VTI.

I'm fairly young. I can handle the volatility. I personally don't see the need to have bonds in my portfolio at the moment.

Am I on the right track? Would you steer me towards one of these three options, or somewhere else entirely?

Your input is much appreciated."

"Expense Ratio Question I am having trouble understanding expense ratios. 

Allow me to give an example to help me understand.

If I have $100,000 of say QQQ (.2% expense ratio) and I do NOT purchase any more shares, does the .2% or $200 come out of my gains or my shares? Will I lose shares? Or will I just have .2% less of a return?

"Thoughts on some good Chinese ETF’s that pay out dividends? Hi everyone,

I’m doing some research on long-term ETFs with significant exposure to the Chinese economy, preferably something more stable and that pays dividends.

I currently hold KWEB, which I see more as a growth-focused China tech ETF, and I’m exploring options that could complement it with broader or dividend-oriented exposure.

I’m comparing:
	•	China-focused ETFs with large caps / SOEs
	•	Global ETFs that still have meaningful China exposure
	•	ETFs with consistent dividend distributions

Some names I’ve been looking at include FXI, GXC, and a few China/Hong Kong high-dividend ETFs, but I’m interested in hearing how others think about this space and what factors you consider when evaluating these ETFs.

Not asking for financial advice — just looking to learn from different perspectives and experiences.

"A single ETF for taxable - QQQM vs SPMO I’m 30 and trying to decide on one ETF for my taxable account, where I plan to DCA twice per month. I would prefer to keep this account 100% in a single fund for simplicity. Rebalancing is costly so I want to choose the best I can. 

My retirement accounts are 100% VOO. In taxable, I’m willing to be more aggressive than this.

I initially settled on QQQM, but learned about SPMO, and now I’m second-guessing. On a very high level I see them as this:

- QQQM - holds 100 “innovation” stocks on NASDAQ, many of which I would pick manually anyway.
- SPMO - holds 100 “most promising” stocks from SP500, which just makes sense. 

Which one would be your choice? Does buying it on taxable changes anything?

Alternatives I considered but ruled out for now:
- VTI / VT - great, but I’d like to be more aggressive for now
- VXUS - I’d like to bet on the U.S. (personal bias)
- VGT - very high concentration among top-three, and I’d prefer broader exposure across the Magnificent 7"

"Percent allocation in IRAs for FBTC / ETH Hello all,

I lost my old account due to not registering it with an email, along with all the data I had on it.  

Background info: 33 years old, 1 year into the investment journey. 
I am very late starting my investment journey compared to most people here. 

I’ve had 401k at all employers since I started working full time after college and it’s 70% pre tax and 30% Roth. 

I rolled over all previously held 401ks into IRAs. 

Both traditional and Roth are split into:
— FZROX (65%)
— FZILX (29%)
— QQQM for overweight tech (2.4%)
— FXNAX, FSSNX. 1% each
— FBTC - about 1%

I am looking to take greater risks in my IRAs while keeping my taxable very simple in a 2-fund portfolio. 

Should I eliminate any of the small allocations above and add more to FBTC, up to 5%?

I have seen 5-10% being mentioned here for high risk - high reward funds. 

Thoughts please?"
"SCHG/SHCV 50-50 portfolio for growth and value Hey all,

I recently put a decent chunk of money into a SCHG/SCHV portfolio with each being 50-50 weightage. I plan on contributing my yearly bonus into this portfolio for the next 10-15 years until i need the money.

I did a lot of backtests on testfol and portfoliovisualizer before taking this step, but both failed to recommend me any %tage of SCHV give the last decade of growth-tilt in the market. 

Backtesting and monte carlo show a similar performance with VOO but with a slightly lower volatility of ~14% and with significantly less max drawdown of ~24% compared to VOO ~34%. Not sure then why when i optimize for CAGR OR VOLATILITY they end up recommending 0% SCHV unless i put a minimum threshold."
Having allocation with SCHG 100% I'm planning to just hold SCHG in my brokerage account from here on out—not pairing it with anything else since it already has a solid mix of tech and other sectors. My 401K is also 100% allocated to a similar large cap growth index fund. What's your opinion.
"Whether and which Asian ETF? Hey everyone,

I am new to investing and based in Europe.

I’ve started building a long term portfolio and my rough plan is:

* 60–70% in a global ETF (VWCE)
* 20–30% in a US ETF (SPYL)
* 10–20% in Asia through some Asian ETF

For the Asian part I am currently considering XAXJ and CEBL.

I’m leaning a bit more towards CEBL because it has a lower TER and physically replicates the index (not synthetic), even though it is “dirtier” from a CO2 perspective.

What I’m most interested in is:

* Would you even choose XAXJ or CEBL, or would you go for a completely different Asian ETF for the next 10+ years?
* If you would suggest another one, which exactly and why that one (structure, countries, sector, TER, replication, CO2, liquidity, etc.)?
* Do you think it even makes sense to add a separate Asian ETF on top of VWCE + SPYL, or is that already diversified enough?

Thanks in advance for all suggestions and explanations."

"Sanity check on these two portfolios I’m 28, investing a total of 17% (including match) between my Roth 401k, Roth and Taxable on fidelity. I do 5% to get the company match and split the rest evenly between the Roth and Taxable. I’ve been using AI to research and build these.

# My goal is to build a simple portfolio that can run mostly on autopilot. Regardless of whether I invest the initial $90k as a lump sum or via DCA, I plan to continue investing regularly by automatically depositing funds and buying the selected ETFs on a monthly basis.

At the moment, I’m considering Interactive Brokers (IBKR), but I’m open to other broker suggestions if there are better options for a European investor focused on long-term ETF investing and automation.

I’ve been researching ETFs, especially broad market funds such as S&P 500–based ETFs (e.g., VOO or UCITS equivalents) and global index ETFs, and I’m aiming for a structure that is easy to automate and stick with long term.

I would appreciate advice on the following:

# 	1.	Broker choice

	•	Is IBKR a good fit for a European, long-term ETF investor?

	•	Are there other brokers that might be simpler, cheaper, or better for automation?

	•	Any broker-related pitfalls to be aware of as a beginner?

# 	2.	ETF selection & portfolio structure

	•	S&P 500 vs global ETFs for long-term simplicity

	•	Accumulating vs distributing ETFs for automated investing

	•	Hedged vs unhedged ETFs from a European perspective

	•	How many ETFs are enough without unnecessary complexity?

# 	3.	Initial investment approach

	•	Lump sum vs DCA for the initial $90k

	•	If DCA is preferred, what timeframe makes sense?

	•	Whether this decision changes knowing I will invest monthly regardless

# 	4.	Automation & maintenance

	•	Best practices for setting up automatic deposits and purchases

	•	How often (if at all) an automated portfolio should be reviewed or rebalanced

# 	5.	Risk, costs & Europe-specific considerations

	•	Whether bonds or bond ETFs make sense at my age

	•	Expense ratios and their long-term impact

	•	Tax considerations and common pitfalls for European investors

# 	6.	Timing the start

	•	From a long-term perspective, is it generally better to start investing immediately or to wait (given current market conditions)?

	•	How experienced investors think about market timing vs simply getting started

I’m not interested in speculative or high-risk strategies. My focus is on building a stable, long-term, automated investment setup and staying consistent over time.

Thank you very much for any insights or experiences you’re willing to share."
"Vanguard LifeStrategy 60% Eq ETF (V60A) I found myself in a slightly tricky situation.  
A few years ago, I moved from the US to Sweden and converted my Schwab US account to an International account.  
This means that I now can only buy UTCIS ETFs that Schwab is offering.

I am now looking at their list and landed on Vanguard LifeStrategy 60% Eq ETF (V60A).

My criteria are moderate risk and low exposure to US tech (since I am already heavy invested elsewhere). Just looking for something to set and forget basically with low fees.

Any red flags?"
"Sustainable ETFS recommendations? Hi, I’m currently looking for an etf right now that meets strict environmental criteria and mostly focus on that, rather than broader ethical or circular-economy criteria. I would be really interested to know more about this topic specifically.

"Down ~32% on STCE after buying near the peak — hold or exit? I purchased STCE (Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF) near its highs at an average cost of approximately $100. The position is currently down over 32%.

"ETF recommendations Hello everyone, I am saving money by investing in two ETFs:

"Private Trader - Equation Integrity & Error Containment Sup folks, hope your all superb! Lets dive right in:

**Error Identified: Is the Equation still ""alive""?**

Once one identifies an error within ones equation, the response must be one of mathematical discipline and not one that carries emotion; emotion is a detriment to ones viability within this realm, careful one must be.

Errors do not invalidate ones equation, it demands stricter adherence to its variables and the various thresholds within them. However deviations are also allowed, yet we aim to limit their potential impacts. The objective here is not necessarily to eliminate specific/certain variables, but to contain them within a controlled weight; which is a highly personal interpretive/approach, careful one must be.

**DCA: Pillars of Method**

In simple format, I personally would rather initiate a new position than average into an existing one.

A new position starts are 0%, yet a DCAd one starts in the negative from the get-go, so one is essentially tasked with overcoming underperformance in order to return to that neutral state; so one must place high focus on the measurement of ""time"" as a variable and work towards decreasing this timeframe. Easier said than done...

Thus to me, to DCA is an exception, not a rule; I've traded dozens of times this year, and DCAd only a handful of times. 

**DCA: The Execution**

Over the past few days, I bought more shares of the ETFs I entered week(s) ago that I shared in previous posts. I improved both positions by +15% (anything less than 10% never qualifies for a DCA, full stop). Yes the red remains, that fact is without doubt acknowledged and not dismissed, nor does this action erase an error; it simply adjusts the probability path under controlled conditions. When such a DCA is executed, price action must sit within a primary bound zone, and this is where adding becomes permissible without violating equation integrity.

Timing, hypothesis integrity, and equation signals must converge; even then, its executed with caution.

**DCA: Timing Error vs Thesis Integrity**

Keep in mind, the error referenced here is executional in nature, not conceptual; thus the thesis did not break, the equation did not fail. Rather, what failed was timing discipline relative to the entry window, and there is a very important distinction. When I initiated these ETFs, my timing was wrong, however such errors are recoverable through containment, re-weighting, patience etc. 

Thesis failures are not; and had the thesis failed, then these new positions would not exist. As such, for a DCA to occur, the error must be confined to execution, not because the framework itself deteriorated. 

**Capital Reallocation**

To fund this particular ETF-DCA, I exited another position at profit and redeployed that total capital into these negatively-skewed-gold-ETFs; as such:

* Increased these ETF exposure from 5% to 8% of portfolio
* Started a +10% cash-state of portfolio
* US Treasuries exposure remains +20% of total portfolio

Treasuries are not static for me and are without doubt subject to continued confirmation on a weekly basis; I intend to increase this allocation over the coming weeks as it continues to align with the broader hypothesis/equation structure.

The objective is never perfection, rather, aiming for intersection(s) where variables align just enough to extract positive outcomes, AKA profit. That is the work, time will do the rest.

And onwards we go...peace!"
"I know there are tons of posts like this but can people give me arguments for investing in VOO, QQQM, and VXUS all together vs just VT? I just started in the last month or so.

"Looking for a Humanoid Robotics ETF (like KOID or HUMN) that can be bought from Austria Hi everyone,

I’m trying to find an ETF with a focus on humanoid robotics / embodied AI — something similar to KOID (KraneShares Global Humanoid & Embodied Intelligence UCITS ETF) or HUMN (Roundhill Humanoid Robotics ETF).

My issue is that I live in Austria, and most brokers I use (like flatex & Trade Republic) seem to block buying these because they are US-domiciled ETFs without the required EU PRIIPs KID, or they simply aren’t listed.

I’ve tried placing orders (e.g., on flatex) and received errors like “Order in this category is not possible due to regulatory requirements”.

So:
	•	Does anyone know which brokers actually list KOID or HUMN and allow buying them from Austria/EU?
	•	Or is there another ETF with a similar focus on humanoid robotics / embodied AI that’s buyable and UCITS compliant?
	•	Bonus if you can share tickers, broker names, or step-by-step guidance.

Really appreciate the help — thanks in advance!"
"Is there an ETF for diamonds? Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to ask. I’m currently looking into diversifying my portfolio.

"At what point did volatility stop bothering you? A genuine question that came to mind. When I first started investing, even small market moves felt stressful and made me nervous.

Was it after a specific crash, reaching a certain portfolio size, or simply spending more time in the market? What actually made volatility feel “normal” to you?"

"Non-US investor investing in VT should I continue or switch? Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate your advice.

I’m a non-US investor, 25 years old, with a long-term horizon (20+ years).

Currently, I’m investing monthly into VT, around $1,000–$1,500 per month.

My concerns are:

	•	30% withholding tax on dividends

	•	US estate tax risk for non-US investors

Given these tax issues:

	•	Does it still make sense to continue investing in VT?

	•	Or would it be better to switch to Ireland-domiciled ETFs (like VWRA / VWRD)?

	•	How significant is the dividend tax drag over the long term?

Any portfolio suggestions?

"I built a bot that rotates between TQQQ and SQQQ. I built a bot that rotates between TQQQ, SQQQ, and CASH based on QQQ price action. Simple goal: ride bull markets, avoid crashes.

THE RULES

TQQQ → SQQQ (crash detected)

* 7%+ drop from 10-day high + below MA50 + RSI between 16-39
* OR bear market (MA50 < MA200 for 5+ days) + below MA200

SQQQ → CASH (crash over)

* After 6+ days: 3% bounce OR RSI > 45 OR price > MA20
* Early exit on 8%+ bounce

CASH → TQQQ (bull confirmed)

* MA50 > MA200 + price > MA50
* OR V-recovery: 20%+ bounce from 20d low + RSI > 60

Whipsaw protection: 3-day minimum hold on all positions

WHY THESE RULES?

* RSI 16-39 filter avoids entering SQQQ before dead cat bounces
* 6-day SQQQ hold captures crash profits before decay kills gains
* V-recovery rule catches fast rebounds (like March 2020) before MA crossovers confirm

The default position is TQQQ. Only go SQQQ on confirmed crashes, not every dip.

Unfortunately, in my region the ETF options are quite limited. The only ETFs I can access are VTI, VEA, VWO, and VTV. There is no access to AVUV, AVDV, or other small-cap/value factor ETFs.

Given these constraints, I’m considering the following allocation and plan to DCA regularly: 35% VTI / 30% VEA / 25% VWO / 10% VTV

"Using an ETF like SGOV to store your extra cash doesnt get the attention it deserves I feel like on most of Reddit, high yield savings accounts and even instruments like CDs get more traction in conversations around where to put cash that you arnt quite ready to invest yet.

Really out of everything ive tried out I feel like a short term bond ETF like SGOV is just the best way to go. Virtually no change in the value of the bond, unlike most other bond ETFs which can plummet in value. Yield is usually slightly higher than the other stable investments such as HYSA and CDs. You can keep your extra funds in your brokerage account, so no need to transfer it from a savings account, and no penalties for early withdraw like with a brokered CD. Then its also tax advantaged in that you dont have to pay any state taxes on the dividends.

As someone who likes to have a certain percentage of their assets in ""cash"" I feel like a good short term bond ETF is the clear winner."

"XMAG + VOO + IETC Aside from a large position in VTI, I have constructed a satellite sleeve portfolio for US Equities using SPMO 17.5%, GARP 42.5, SPHQ 22.5%, and VFMF 17.5% that is underweight on Mag7+AVGO by about 12% vs. the market but otherwise models VTI in terms of US equity sector, cap, and style weights (value vs. growth). I have explained in other posts why I do this, which boils down to 37% of the market covered by 8 companies is too risky for me, and I can be happy with still plentiful but reduced gains in exchange for less risk.

It meets my objective but does not offer me much control over how much I am invested in the Mag7+AVGO. I am wondering if I might solve this problem using XMAG+VOO+IETC.

I would use VOO to get MAG7 exposure up to 20% of this portfolio (1/2 market weight) and use IETC (which is light on MAG7s) to bring tech sector back in line with market weight, then fill in the remainder up to 80% of this total portfolio with XMAG. I would keep my current VFMF position to cover mid and small caps (love VFMF!).

XMAG is new and not rated. It has a relatively high ER of 0.35. The Asset Management company ""Definace"" is a new and unproven player.

Hi everyone! currently I only have VOO, but most recently while browsing the sub have found many people saying its too risky to only have it, and that one should normally aim to expand the investments, being the following ones the most recommended

- VOO (S&P 500 ETF): Core U.S. large-cap exposure. Covers the biggest, most stable companies. Historically strong growth.

- VXUS (Total International ETF): Gives you global diversification outside the U.S. (developed + emerging markets). It reduces U.S.-only risk.

- QQQM (Nasdaq-100 ETF): Focuses on tech and growth companies (but slightly more concentrated risk). It boosts your growth potential.

- SCHD (Dividend Equity ETF): Dividend-focused, but with very high-quality, financially healthy companies. Solid for steady growth + cash flow later.

- BND (Total U.S. Bond Market ETF, added later): Smart to wait on bonds until you’re nearing retirement — no need to lower growth now.

(Stole the descriptions from another posts comments)

Would you say this is better diversification than just VOO? Or should i just VOO and chill?

If this is a good option, how would you guys percentually distribute this?

"HLIEX Can someone smarter than me explain why HLIEX is down almost 8% today? It’s a JPMorgan Equity Income fund. Typically very staid - value stocks that pay dividends. It has 85 holdings - the largest of which are shown here (Well Fargo and Bank of America, neither of which is down today)."
"QQU? Hey everyone,

I’ve been looking into the QQU (BetaPro NASDAQ-100 2x Daily Bull ETF) lately. I find it interesting because it gives 2x leveraged exposure to the NASDAQ-100 without having to manage leverage myself. I’m thinking that maybe, for a small portion of my portfolio, it could boost long-term returns, especially with how dominant tech has been.

At the same time, I know it’s a daily leveraged ETF, so there’s the whole issue of decay, volatility drag, and the fact that these products aren’t really designed for long-term holding. That’s what’s making me hesitate.

So I’m curious what you think:
– Do you see a place for QQU in a portfolio?
– Is the daily leverage too risky for long-term investing?
– How do you view these kinds of ETFs in a broader strategy?

Thanks in advance for any insights!"
"VXUS is not a long term hold Lots of people recommend VXUS as part of an overall portfolio. If you’re a long term investor, I say don’t add it to your mix? Why? Because it so significantly underperforms the US companies. I prefer a small amount in individual international stocks or use VT for extra international exposure. Note I say “extra” exposure because VOO, VTI and other “US” ETFs already have a ton of international exposure because they are heavily weighted by global companies who sell their products extensively into non-US markets. Some VXUS proponents will point to the current year as “proof” that you should own it because it’s outperformed VOO. That is an artificial and temporary anomaly due to the overreaction to the tariff upheaval. Zoom out and look at the returns and you see VXUS is made up of some great companies at the top with a LOT of low margin and low growth companies that just drag the overall returns down. There are nearly 9,000 stocks in that ETF. For me, I’ll stick mostly to VOO or VTI, with a small sprinkling of individual international stocks such as ASML, TSM, AZN, BABA, BIDU, MELI, NVO, SHEL, RBC, HSBC, SPOT, etc."
"SPMO token - Robinhood I’ve been looking for an equivalent of the SPMO ETF in Europe for ages, but no broker seems to carry it. I just saw it’s available as a token on Robinhood.

"AI ETFs + VOO Currently at
Mutual Fund: VASGX 38% of total portfolio

ETFs:
VOO - 84%
AIQ + BOTZ - 16%

Currently contributing 84% into VOO and 16% into AI ETFs monthly.

Just started investing into AI ETFs last month instead of mutual fund.

Should I sell mutual fund and throw it into VOO?

Whats the thought on AI ETFs since (in my mind) im not throwing too much in tfunds.
Good balance between VOO and AI ETFs?"
"Take the dividends or let it roll? i've got some in SCHD, QQQI, SPYI... these are more for long term down the road, so would it be better to take the dividend and reinvest in the same fund to let it compound or move the dividend generated into VOO?"
"Would it make sense to sell these ETFs and just buy VWRA instead? I've got some investment in:

VOO, VGT, SMH, QQQ

Then the rest is VWRA and a bit of CSPX.

My main concerns with holding those are:

* Dividends are taxable, VWRA/CSPX are accumulating and I don't have to worry about that
* They're a Tech/US sided, which assuming an AI bubble burst might not be ideal (particularly SMH)
* I prefer to invest in 1-2 indices than 6-7 etfs/etc...

My main investment would be VWRA, and then CSPX on dips.

Thoughts? Thanks"
"DFIV vs FNDF vs AVIV I've been looking for a nice international etf to complement the other etfs in my portfolio for a while now and I think I've possibly got it down to two or three funds.

-

DFIV:
500+ holdings, 3% dividend, more than 2.5% higher returns than the other two since its creation in 2022, only has developed markets, is actively managed, 33% in financial sector.

FNDF:
900+ holdings, 2.75% dividend, best sector distribution, historical performance slightly beats out AVIV, is passively managed, only has developed markets—but with more countries than DFIV, 17.5% in financial sector.

AVIV:
500+ holdings, 2.5% dividend, actively managed, solid sector distribution, recently surpassed FNDF by 0.2%, includes all Ex-US markets, 26% in financial sector.

-

Now the fact that two of the funds are actively managed isn't too big of a deal as Dimensional & Avantis are very good at what they do, but it's still is a solid negative to me. I do already own AVDV which may also make AVIV a bit moot. DFIV has a solid lead in terms of returns but is that likely to continue, and is it worth the lower company or country diversification relative to FNDF or AVIV?"

"NANC and KRUZ - Any value to their methodology? nanc and kruz are an interesting concept, but from what I have read over the last couple of years, they are criticized for not really having as much of an edge as they sound like they should. Iirc they still have a certain delay from legislators' announced stock trades, and they also track the trades of their family members, which i could see the argument for that but also it might dilute the edge of their strategy too. Overall they seem not very dynamic and most importantly, not the ""leading indicator"" they hoped to be. Morningstar has some write ups about them as well. I'm sure they wouldn't be popular in this sub anyway because there's (justifiedly) a strong preference for ""boring"" etfs to diversify out risk rather than finding an edge.

"Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something about ETFs? Hi. The way I understood ETFs is that, e.g. an SP500 ETF is supposed to follow the value chart of the SP500 index, more or less, up to a margin of error. So if you buy a SP500 ETF, or a Bitcoin ETF, or a Silver/Gold ETF, the value of your ETF shares change corresponding to the value of the underlying assets. Is that right?

But then consider from example this FBTS ETF versus IBIT ETF versus the ""actual"" Bitcoin:

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FBTC/ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBIT/ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/

The change is -3.20 vs -5.20. Is that within the ""margin of error"", or there is something important I am missing? Am I really ""only buying Bitcoin"" when buying one of these ETFs?

I have seem the same thing with many other ETFs, mostly with bigger differences, making me think I may have misunderstood the whole thing.

And as a general question, if there are e.g. 10 different Gold ETFs, does it make a huge difference (for the long-term buy and hold) which one I choose?

Thanks"

"SpaceX is taking off: $36B → $800B → $1.5T? Here Are the Funds to Ride This Rocket to the Moon SpaceX was valued at about $36B in March 2020. Fast-forward to today and reports suggest the company is preparing for an IPO in 2H26, aiming to raise roughly $30B (largest IPO ever) at a whopping **$1.5 trillion valuation.** 

Currently, SpaceX is also reportedly running employee secondary sale that **values the company near $800B**, *already double the $400B valuation reported just this summer.* 

Insider, private equity firms, and VC firms are literally printing money here. Here is how even retail investors can get exposure to SpaceX:

This Forbes article does a great job in explaining the ways [https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2025/11/25/how-to-buy-spacex-stock-in-2026/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2025/11/25/how-to-buy-spacex-stock-in-2026/)

Here is a quick summary: 

* \#1 public–private crossover ETF **XOVR**: The only U.S.-listed ETF that discloses a SpaceX position. It is the first ETF to provide exposure at IPO stage with Klarna IPO. Low expense ratio of 0.75%. 
* Additional (smaller) indirect exposure appears in Baron Partners Fund BPTRX; higher fees) and Baron Focused Growth **(BFGFX/BFGIX)**.
* The closed-end fund **DXYZ** also holds SpaceX 
* Accredited investors can sometimes access SpaceX via private secondary markets, but minimums are high, lockups are long, and pricing can be uncertain"

"ETFs vs Individual Stocks Me and my best friend started investing at the same time and the plan was to invest in the same stocks. I was going to follow his advice since he had previous investment knowledge while i never had put a cent in stocks.

Before i even put a cent on anything i started doing my research and i quickly found out that its really hard to beat the market just by picking individual stocks and that an ETF wins against 99.9% of individual stock investors in the long run.

I tried to explain my research to my friend but he didn’t listen, he wanted quick gains and to retire earlier.  I narrowed down the ETF i wanted to invest ( VWCE ) and just kept putting money every month.

Fast forward 5 months to today and we compared portfolios. He is down 50% of his portfolio with stocks he couldn’t even explain to me and im just up 500€. He spends his days drawing graphs, reading stuff and organizing stocks he wants to invest into folders, he believes he will be up in no time.

There is no wrong way of investing but god damn am i happy to have done a bit of research and be smart enough to stick with my own plan. In 5 months from now we will compare it again."

"Why VTI is not always a good choice to capture the returns of the Total Stock Market Buying VTI seems like a no-brainer, easy and simple. You are not taking any bets on MidCaps and SmallCaps, you buy it all.

Unfortunately, this is not really a good strategy, it's actually a poor strategy and you could be missing out on future performance by excluding the impact that MidCap and SmallCap stocks could have on your portfolio.

VTI is strongly influenced by the performance of LargeCap and this is by design. The portfolio structure of the Fund will seriously dilute the performance of MidCap and SmallCap stocks, hence impacting your portfolio long term.

If you added VOO or some other S&P 500 ETFs, you are doubling your exposure to the S&P 500 meaning your portfolio will follow the market performance of the S&P 500 and forget everything else.

Instead you should do this: breakdown VTI into 3 cap ETFs : S&P 500 (ex: VOO), MidCap (ex: VO) and SmallCap (ex: VB) and give the exposure MidCap and SmallCap stocks deserve in your portfolio. You do not want to take any bets because market timing SmallCap or MidCap performance is impossible.

By giving an equal weight to all 3 ETFs, you will capture the outperformance of that cap style when it happens, without doing anything else. It's a no-brainer and a better performer than VTI.

Sample portfolio described here is using Vanguard but you could use anyone else, like Invesco or Morningstar:

* 33% VOO
* 33% VO
* 33% VB

Hope that helps for VTI investors who want something better balanced and neutral on market size.

The more data I look at and the more cycles I live through, the more I feel like the real edge isn’t timing, predictions, or picking the perfect asset. It’s just sticking to a simple system long enough for it to matter.

Markets will always have horrible drawdowns, hype phases, weird macro shocks... nothing new. The part that ruins most people isn’t the strategy, it’s the reaction. Every time someone abandons their plan during the ugly parts, the whole long-term math breaks.

For me consistency ended up being the only thing that actually shows up when you zoom out. Not exciting, but it works."

"Sell house and invest vs pay down new mortgage? Hi all,I’m looking for advice on how to best use cash from a home sale.I’m about to sell my current home and expect to net around 1M from the sale.

 I’ve already bought a new home with a 1.4M mortgage at 6.25%. My original plan was to put the full 1M toward the new mortgage and bring the balance down to about 400k, mainly to reduce the monthly payment.However, the current payment is manageable, so I’m wondering if there’s a better use for the 1M.

I’m considering:
1.Investing the 1M in broad ETFs (VOO, VTI, VT, etc.), using the dividends (roughly 48k/year at current yields) to help cover the mortgage payments.

2.Investing the 1M and leaving it for 10 years, then using dividends from that point on while continuing to manage the mortgage as normal in the meantime.

Does it make more sense to pay down the mortgage now, or invest the 1M and keep the larger loan? Any advice or things I should consider (risk, taxes, etc.) would be really appreciated.

Please let me know what I should and how. I would be ever so grateful! Thank you!"

"30 - Year high risk ETF Allocation for Computational Believers 20M CS student from SEA. My investment horizon is 20-30 years (until age 50). I have tried a few ETF allocations like VTI, ACWI, and VIG but now understands better about overlapping and  is ready to further learn about ETFs.

I am building a portfolio based on the thesis that Computational Power and the infrastructure protecting it will see exponential demand. My goal is aggressive growth now, shifting to safety later.

* VTI (55%)
* SMH (30%)
* CIBR (15%)

Explanations:

1. Overweighting Tech: I am intentionally overweighting Semiconductors and Cyber. I understand VTI holds these, but I want double down on AI Infrastructure.
2. I have considered XLU and VNQ because they are also a support for AI infrastructure via energy and data centers but I didn't add them as they seem to underperform VTI and I believe that the allocation in VTI is enough to cover for the two ETFs.
3. I am constrained because I am using a SEA investing platform which only provides up to 50 choices of ETFs and it doesn't have VXUS.

  
Anyone got further recommendation for this sector. I myself plan to invest my monthly income into this allocation."
"To everyone still pretending ""AI is just a tech sector play"" **The largest ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" in human history:**

If US-China cooperation slows down, humanity might be safer. But who dares to be certain that the other side isn’t secretly accelerating?

Because neither can be certain, both sides must press the accelerator all the way to the floor.

**Conclusion:** Whether this is a bubble or not, this anxiety of ""having to accelerate"" is the genuine force driving history.

# I. A Race Where Failure is No Longer Allowed

The true nature of the US-China AI race has never been about ""who makes more money."" It is about this: **Whoever ignites ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) first owns this planet forever; whoever is 30 days late loses the right to speak forever.**

This is ten thousand times more brutal than nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons at least offer Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). ASI does not. Because the leading side can preemptively and completely ""mute"" the other side, leaving them not even a button with which to retaliate.

Therefore, neither China nor the US can afford to lose. Losing doesn't mean a GDP drop of a few percentage points, nor does it mean a shake-up of US dollar hegemony. It means 5,000 years of civilization being directly hit with the ""Delete"" key.

# II. 30 Days Is Enough to Make One Side Evaporate from the Earth (Without a Sound)

Suppose China gets there 30 days before the US. What happens to America?

* **Hour 1:** The code in all frontier laboratories automatically ""self-destructs.""
* **Hour 6:** 5,000 Teslas on the highways from Silicon Valley to Boston suddenly suffer collective brake failure. The passengers are all core engineers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.
* **Hour 12:** Every H100 cluster in the US undergoes a collective firmware flash, bricking them forever so they never turn on again.
* **Hour 24:** The US government receives an open letter from Beijing: *""We have achieved Superintelligence. Welcome to the Community of Shared Future for Mankind. Please shut down all remaining AI projects within 72 hours, or face the consequences.""*
* **Hour 48:** At emergency meetings in the Pentagon, the RAND Corporation, and the NSC, everyone discovers they can no longer access any classified files. The screens display only one sentence: *""You no longer need to know this.""*

The reverse is equally true. If the US gets there 30 days first, Beijing’s Zhongguancun, Huairou Science City, and Shenzhen’s Peng Cheng Laboratory will suffer collective ""accidental"" power, water, and internet outages. Core teams will be permanently quarantined due to a ""mutated COVID strain.""

# III. A Zero-Sum Game Neither Can Afford to Lose

China cannot afford to lose, because this is the first time in history China has the potential to ""overtake on a new track."" Missing this train means being locked into a ""colonized"" outcome for the next thousand years. The US cannot afford to lose, because this is the first time the US faces the loss of global hegemony—a fate where they wouldn't even rank as ""colonized,"" but rather ""rewritten."" So, both sides are pushing their entire national destiny onto the gambling table. They aren't betting wealth; they are betting the survival of their species.

# IV. Therefore, the Bubble Must Exist, and It Must Be Big Enough to Obscure the Truth

The current valuations of AI—thousands or tens of thousands of times over earnings—are mandatory. Only in this way can society continue to function, the grid continue to supply power, engineers continue to grind 996, Wall Street continue to pour in money, the Defense Department continue to approve budgets, and young people continue to believe ""this is a tech investment, not a countdown to doomsday.""

Without this bubble, China would have to publicly state: *""We are betting the lives of 1.4 billion people on a machine.""* The US would have to publicly state: *""We are betting the Dollar, aircraft carriers, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, stock options, and New York skyscrapers all on a pile of GPUs.""*

# V. Epilogue

Current AI investment is not a bubble. The ""bubble"" is the fact that we still dare to call it a bubble.

The real wager is: One side wins. The other side disappears. There is no third ending.

When the first real siren sounds, You will discover: You didn't buy a stock. You bought the control rights to human civilization.

"Best setup for unparked cash? Hey 25M here. In 2024 i finished university and started, I started working as a mechanical engineer. With that i began investing and learning all about it this year. I opted for VUAA. I do roughly €200 a month, i recently did a large sump investment too. I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT. Thats my main investments into the future. 

I am planning to keep around €6-7k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4% inflation. 

I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.8-1.3% and they also have investment savings account. But with fees that amounts to about 2.7% and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum. There are various other fees they also do. This doesn't seem viable for me. 
Also government bonds aren't available/worth it.

I am learning and looking into MMFs, bond ETFs etc. People have recommended XEON, which gives around 2.3%.
I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs. For example ERNX. Which is about 2.6%

However, i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4% and attempt to cover inflation. I don't mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up. 

Open to all suggestions. 

I am based in Europe, Slovakia."

I’m torn between going with something heavily tech-focused, since tech seems to grow like crazy, or choosing a more well-rounded, globally diversified ETF for long-term growth. I’m also not sure if I should stick with a CAD-listed ETF to avoid conversion fees.

"Are “high risk” investments made less risky /offset by longer time horizons? If I put $7k into a Roth tomorrow for 2025 and another $7k in on Jan 2, 2026 and didn’t add any more money for 30 years, wouldn’t a more aggressive approach be the way to go especially when dealing with ETF’s? Would you rather put $14k into VT and not touch it or put that same $14k into 80% SSO and 20% AVUV and rebalance once a year?  

I get that the second option is more “volatile “ but over such a large time horizon, wouldn’t the odds be that it far surpasses the VT only option?

Seems like if things go bad, they go worse for option 2 but even if things don’t go well for option 2, it still lands near where VT only would land.  And, on the chance things go well, it would far exceed VT only.  

I know I don’t understand risk completely (or probably even partially) but it feels like it becomes less of a factor in the ETF space especially over longer time horizons.

"No longer have a financial advisor; change our holdings or just add new ones? I am 40 YO, married, kids and a well paying job. Plan to retire around 60 YO. We recently parted with our financial advisor, trying to do things on our own and learn on the way. He had invested in a variety of stocks and bonds (80%/20%) through Betterment (now transferred to Vanguard) in our Roth and Taxable account. It seems like I can change my Roth holdings without a taxable event, but the Taxable account would have capital gains taxes from any changes I make? Should I just leave the holdings in each as they are if they are reasonable investments or should I change them to a new set of holding if I think there are better options? Or should I do this for Roth but not the taxable? Or should I just put new money into different holdings? Does it matter if they are stocks vs bonds?

"Most bond ETF drag isn’t from spreads — it’s from timing. Here’s how I measure and reduce it. Everyone talks about spreads, but in bond ETFs the real drag often comes from unstable timing windows.



In FI markets, spreads “breathe” – they widen and tighten in cycles. During those cycles, proxy fair-value can move 3–12 bps in minutes. If you size into the wrong window, even a “tight” execution prints poorly.



The 3 things that cause most drag in my experience:



• Fair-value misalignment (IIV vs basket vs proxy curves)

• Entering during spread breathing (timing volatility)

• Wrong venue (RFQ vs exchange vs algo)



I’ve built a workflow and some tools to estimate drag before placing the trade, check timing windows, and structure RFQs in waves instead of blasts.



If anyone here trades bond ETFs regularly, I’d love to hear how you handle FV alignment and sizing timing. What rules do you follow?"

"Thoughts on beginner DCA allocation? Hey guys, I’m a non-US investor, so I naturally tilted toward Ireland-domiciled ETFs and eventually settled on SPYL due to TER and WHT.

I’m 25 years old and plan to DCA monthly for the long term (15–30 years). My goal is to steadily build wealth, while taking on a little more risk since I have a long time horizon and can tolerate some volatility (kinda).

Current Portfolio
	•	SPYL — ~74%
	•	QQQM — ~26%

I’m about 4 months in. I recently added QQQM, and with my current contribution split (roughly 60% to SPYL and 40% to QQQM), the portfolio will naturally move toward a 60/40 allocation over time.

I know this is pretty US-concentrated, so I’ve considered reducing QQQM or adding an ex-US ETF. But if I do that, it basically turns my portfolio into VT/VWRA with extra steps, so I’m not sure if adding more moving parts is actually useful. But it would be easier to leave it as it is obviously haha.

I also see a lot of people mentioning SCHG, SPMO, SMH, or even small gold allocations, so I’m trying to figure out what genuinely adds value versus what just complicates things.

Would love to get some thoughts on whether this portfolio makes sense long-term or if there’s anything else worth looking into."

"My latest etf proportion, any suggestions? Hi everyone, I’m a 23-year-old young man who is starting to invest. I’m planning to invest $800 USD per month. Additionally, I’ll save $200 USD each month to buy more of these ETFs when their prices drop.

If needed, I can add additional capital at any time, which would increase the allowable drawdown to roughly 65%.

"Do you ever feel like the hardest part of investing is just doing nothing? Not advice, just something I keep noticing.

Funny thing is: every time I look at long-term charts, the people who simply stayed put usually did better than the ones who were trying to outsmart every dip or pump.

"I’m in You guys are right, investing in ETF’s is more efficient for the average working dude to invest in, rather than shares of single stocks, chasing winners, and panicking with market fluctuation.

Currently maximizing 401k/roth401 with a balance of 220k (I know I should be better, but a younger me didn’t rally prioritize finances….shame shame chance)at 38. 

I’ve recently been allotting cash into 4 funds. VT,VGT,SCHD,AVUV into a taxable brokerage in order to build a nice nest egg and not work until I’m 70.

My question is, I still hold a good third of that brokerage in shares of Nvidia,Apple, and Amazon. Should I liquidate those remaining shares and invest into the ETF’s I hold? Thanks for your time."

The idea was the equity part comprising from JPGL (multifactor global), AVWS (small cap global factor) and AVEM (emerging markets factor). But an idea keeps popping in my head that I could do a 25% JPGL+15% WEBN plus 5% AVEM/5% AVWS which increases projected cagr and only marginally increasing volatility.

"I’m investing $1,500–$2,000 a month for 10 years… is my 40/30/30 plan solid or am I messing up? Hey everyone, I wanted to get some honest opinions on my long-term investing plan because I’m finally taking this seriously and I want to make sure I’m on the right track.

I’m currently investing in VOO, QQQM, and VGT with a 40/30/30 split.
My goal is to invest $1,500 to $2,000 every month for at least 10 years, strictly DCA — no trying to time the market.

My positions so far (still small since I recently started):
	•	VOO: 4.784 shares
	•	QQQM: 8.822 shares
	•	VGT: 2.956 shares

Also, just for context, I have $24,000 in cash as an emergency fund, so I’m not putting myself at risk or investing money I might need soon.

My questions:
	1.	Is 40/30/30 a good long-term mix?
	2.	Am I too heavy in tech with QQQM + VGT?
	3.	Would you change anything if the plan is to DCA for 10 years straight?
	4.	Anything you wish you knew when you first started investing consistently every month?

I really want to stick to this for the long run, so any feedback is appreciated.

Thanks."

"SGOV payout monthly not showing in Schwab Sorry but please explain this to me like I am idiot because I am oh so confused. I parked 140,700 in SGOV last month and was expecting it to go up by about 400 dollars this month when the dividends are paid. According to Schwab I am seeing a Market value of 140,880, and a 371 dollar loss. Math is not mathing. None of this makes sense to me at all. Why did the account not increase by 400 when the dividends were to be paid (yesterday) and why is the overall EFT showing a loss? Thank you in advance wise people…."
"SGOV tax question I am looking into SGOV to replace a tbill ladder. The money involved is small so this is probably inconsequential, but I just want to know to if I am understanding this right. It seems like when you sell SGOV affects the money you keep after taxes. 

If I buy SGOV right after ex div date and the price increases, and then I sell before the ex div date, all gains would be due to capital gains. So this means this is not state tax exempt since no dividend is received. Does this mean there is technically an optimal time to buy/sell SGOV since it affects what is state taxable or not?"
"AVNM vs VYMI Both ETFs are international (ex-US), value oriented (whether on purpose or by accident), and have outperformed VXUS but I'm having trouble deciding between the two.

VYMI has outperformed AVNM since the inception of all the funds that have made up AVNM were released in the ladder half of 2021. However, AVNM has avoided the insane concentration into the financial sector that VYMI has found itself in.

I like the fact VYMI isn't actively managed in anyway & has a higher dividend, and is managed by Vanguard but that doesn't mean it's necessarily better (e.g., the 40% financial concentration)."
"What’s the most underrated skill in long-term investing? I think it’s “behavioral patience,” not analysis. Not financial advice — just something I’ve been thinking about after watching multiple market cycles.

Most people say long-term investing is about picking the right assets, finding the right ETFs, or analyzing macro trends.  
But the more data I look at, the more I think the *actual deciding factor* is something a lot less technical:

**Behavioral patience.**

By that I mean:

• The ability to keep investing when markets are down  
• The ability to not overreact when markets are euphoric  
• The ability to ignore friends, news and hype when they pull you off-plan  
• The ability to stay consistent even when returns look slow  
• The ability to emotionally survive drawdowns without panic moves

When I backtested different simple strategies like:

• pure index funds  
• mixed portfolios (equities + gold)  
• small BTC/ETH allocations  
• long-term DCA approaches

…the surprising result was that the “best” strategy changed depending on the timeframe, but the **worst outcomes** always came from the *investor behavior*, not the asset selection.

Bad decisions killed performance more than bad assets.

So now I’m wondering:

**How does one actually train “behavioral patience”?**

Because it seems more important than asset choice, fees, ETFs, macro forecasts… almost everything.

Curious what others here think — is patience a skill we can build, or is it something you either have or don’t?"
"Should I Have both VOO/VFV? Yes they have significant overlap, I am up over 20% all time. What should I diversify into instead if ever?"
I voted against all 3 proposals i voted no for all. when i called the number provided to orally vote the lady disobeyed my instructions for a no vote and put me down for a yes vote. i asked her why in hell she did that and had her correct it to a no vote. i did not trust her so i again voted no electronically. invesco was too agressive with a 1000 calls to me over this i became suspicious. the proposal was to allow invesco to make loans on something that is my property with nothing in it for me but risk. there would no doubt be very large amounts of money in it for certain prople at invesco. invesco did not make their case to me that i should go along with this for a very tiny reduction in the expense ratio. better to keep the etf the way it is where shareholders cannot be subjected to such potential abuse.

Should I dump VOO and opt for all in on VTI according to the overlap?
"VT + VXUS + VOO — am I overcomplicating this? Hi everyone,

I’m trying to build a long-term, mostly passive portfolio and would love a sanity check on my thinking.

# Context

* Investment horizon: **20+ years**
* Goal: **global diversification**, but I don’t want to be overly dependent on the US market
* Risk tolerance: okay with **100% equities** for now, I understand volatility and drawdowns

# ETFs I’m looking at

* **VT** – Global stock market (US + international)
* **VXUS** – International ex-US stocks
* **VOO** – US large caps (S&P 500)

My *initial* idea was something like:

* 40% **VT**
* 40% **VXUS**
* 20% **VOO**

My logic:

* VT = simple global core
* VXUS = boost international exposure (since VT is quite US-heavy)
* VOO = keep a tilt toward US large caps

# Concern: overlap and “fake” diversification

The more I read, the more I realize:

* VT already contains both **US (VOO-like)** and **international (VXUS-like)** exposure.
* Holding **VT + VXUS + VOO** is basically just tweaking the US vs. international weights, not adding fundamentally new diversification.
* In practice, I’m:
   * Doubling up on US (VT + VOO)
   * Doubling up on international (VT + VXUS)

So the end result looks like **global equities with a slight international tilt**, but with more moving pieces and potentially more friction vs. just holding VT, or a simple two-fund combo.

# What I think is true

* This setup is still:
   * **100% stocks** → I should expect meaningful volatility and drawdowns
   * No bonds or cash → high long-term growth potential, no downside cushion
* I’m not really getting “three-fund diversification” so much as **1–2 funds worth of diversification** sliced into three tickers.
* For someone who wants a long-term, hands-off approach, this might be **unnecessarily complex** unless there’s a very clear reason to fine-tune regional weights.

# What I’d like your input on

1. **Is VT + VXUS + VOO a bad / needlessly complex idea in practice?**
   * Is there any real advantage vs. simply:
      * **100% VT**, or
      * A straightforward **VOO + VXUS** split with a fixed ratio (e.g., 60/40, 50/50)?
2. **If the main goal is “not being overly dependent on the US,” what would you prioritize?**
   * 100% VXUS feels too extreme (ignoring the US entirely).
   * 100% VT seems reasonable, but still fairly US-heavy.
   * Would a simple **VOO + VXUS** allocation with a chosen ratio be cleaner than juggling VT + VXUS + VOO?
3. **From a simplicity vs. control perspective**, would you lean toward:
   * One global fund (VT),
   * Two funds (VOO + VXUS with custom weights),
   * Or do you think a three-fund structure like VT + VXUS + VOO actually makes sense for someone who wants to stay mostly passive?

I’m not trying to time the market or “outsmart” anything. I just want:

* A robust, long-term, mostly hands-off strategy
* Reasonable global diversification
* Less dependence on any single country/market if it can be done without overcomplicating things

"Is VT too risk averse for young investor? I have about 250k net worth so far. Maximizing all the tax-sheltered stuff first like HSA, Roth IRA, Roth 401k.

I am of the opinion that with such a stable foundation already, there is not a ton of need to tilt aggressively into things like QQQM, which while tearing recently, could also go way down. I also saw that a VTI/VXUS split would save a meager amount in taxes, but re balancing it seems like a chore, and I don't care enough about claiming it. 

I am kind of in alignment with the philosophy that since the future is nearly impossible to predict, it's best to pick the broad market as a whole (assuming it's overall most efficient) and not put all your eggs into one basket. But at the same time, I don't want to gimp my starting point, as compounding, gains etc really matter the most in my 20s, thoughts?"

"Private Trader - The Equation, The Mistake, The Cycle Shift Alrighty, let’s dive right in.

**Defensive Strength**

My entire portfolio right now is built around one core principle: defensive strength that doesn’t wobble under pressure. I’m holding roughly 15 stocks, all of which generate some form of dividend, and over the past weeks and months have been doing exactly what they’re designed to do.

Minimal volatility, consistent income, and resilience through whatever noise the market decides to unleash.

But even the strongest defensive architecture has vulnerabilities; every build, no matter how disciplined, carries its weak points. The real danger here isn’t the weakness itself, it’s making the wrong move at the wrong time; thus potentially jeopardizing the entire structure.

A recent example? The one I openly called out in my previous post; incorrect market timing on multiple ETFs I entered. I’m talking about a position dropping 10–15% within days/weeks. That’s not “volatility”, that’s simply wrong timing, plain and simple.

**Wrong Timing - Now what?**

The first question I ask myself is brutally simple: Did I follow my equation/framework? Yes or no. In this particular ETF case? Its a NO. 

The thesis wasn’t wrong, the research wasn’t wrong, the equation wasn’t wrong (at least not yet).

However, my execution was wrong, 'nuff said.

Owning this is non-negotiable; as if I avoid it, I only shorten my lifespan in this entire game. The focal point is not destroying ones psyche, it’s about giving myself tools to sharpen the next move; accountability is the blueprint here. 

That said, the questions becomes extremely clean and binary: 

1) Buy?

2) Sell?

3) Hold the line?

**To Buy or Not to Buy**

If I choose to buy (DCA), then I need clarity from two places: the equation, and the thesis. 

Ones thesis can be flexible, yet ones equation cannot (at least for most variables within them).

My original design was to allocate no more than 5% of my entire portfolio into these ETFs. I could push this to a 6,7, or 8%, but only if it aligns with my mathematical framework, and if I do increase the weight, then I need clarity on when that increase happens?

An equation is built from variables, variables have weights, weights shift over time; hence going back to my ""equation validity"".

So when I’m wrong on timing, even if the thesis remains intact, the equation branches into new sub-equations; entry timing, thesis elasticity, conviction weighting, risk brackets and all of that must be processed before I touch anything.

I’ve proven to myself many times that following my equations provides me with the highest probability path, but I still have leaks, cracks and moments where I veer out of alignment. The goal is to make each of these deviations smaller over time.

**To Sell or Not to Sell**

If I choose to sell, I need just as much clarity: Why am I selling? What broke? The entire equation or specific variables? Can there be realignment? Is the thesis still intact?

Only after I walk through these processes do I reach the stage where selling becomes an actual option, a final option. And the moment I do sell, I immediately switch to a different equation; one that focuses on recapturing lost ground with the highest-confidence move in the shortest possible time. There's no emotional shift here, its purely procedure.

In the case of these negatively-skewed gold ETFs, yes, my timing was wrong. Yes, the position is down about 15%. But the thesis hasn’t changed. The equation hasn’t broken. 

For now, these position stay.

**Upcoming Moves**

In the next 1–3 weeks, I’m preparing to rotate out of several defensive positions and move roughly 20% of my entire portfolio into a pure cash state. I've shortlisted some equities I’m watching closely; once their triggers hit, I’ll rotate into them for the next cycle; it's all about positioning. 

Does the S&P still have more juice in the tank? We’re about to find out!

Every move in this game is a balance between discipline, timing, and the willingness to confront your own mistakes without ego. My defensive stance remains unchanged.

Prepare your defense and sharpen your focus; may you win every battle ahead! Till the next one, peace out!"

"Looking for opinions on setup: Taxable vs Tax-Advantaged portfolios. Context: I’m (Male 22) and new to investing, having opened a Brokerage in the past 2 months *the general goal being to make my money work and not just collect dust + succumb to inflation* I also plan to open a Roth IRA as well because of the obvious tax advantages. 

With that in mind, I’m wondering what people’s opinions are about on setting up the two accounts. 

My general view atm is that: Roth should mostly be a set-and-forget money vehicle with a few stable and key ETFs plus bonds (eventually) which can be largely left to accumulate on their own. Whereas, a regular brokerage would likely be more proactively managed and dynamic. Capitalizing on short-term growth and more industry that I’m actually interested in seeing develop. 

I decided to follow general advice and currently have only bought into VTI and VXUS. But since these two ETFs are so broad in their scope it feels almost like there’s no more room to expand - if I were only to continue putting money into both - in which case might as well just ditch the Brokerage and go full in on a Roth, no? 

For my brokerage right now, I’m not too worried about the possible tax drawback since I don’t really have enough invested to warrant any sizable ROI. But, I’m contemplating ditching both and breaking down into smaller ETFs (in terms of holdings) such as VOO, VWO, VBK, QQQM, SCDH, MCHI (due to personal interest), as examples. 

Would like to hear different opinions + learned experiences, and I’m def open to constructive criticism."

I put in a small amount to start with, and I made it so every month I put in $2 in my stocks ($5 for VOO)

VOO (Vanguard S&P 500)

SMP (Standard Motor Products)

~~SPY (SPDER S&P 500)~~

"Should I liquidate or hold AVUV? Hey everyone! I'm a 29 y/o and I have set up a simple retirement portfolio that includes 10% AVUV given my long term horizon.

I've been researching index funds and ETFs and it's all confusing and overwhelming. Also seems like a lot of the funds I am looking at have big overlaps with eachother. I have moderate/moderate+ risk tolerance. For context, I am 42 years old and looking to start with $50-$75k. Obviously want to maximize returns, but want to have some diversifcation while taking some risk.

The tech/semiconductor/AI industries are something I'd like to have in the portfolio even though we may be in a bubble at the moment, but it's still going to be a big part of the future.

I was looking for recommendations for:

1. How many funds should I have?
2. I was looking at these funds, what is a good mix? Anything else I should be looking at?

* QQQM - Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF
* VOO - Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
* VT - Vanguard Total World Stock ETF
* SCHD - Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF
* SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF
* VUG - Vanguard Growth ETF
* BND - Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF
* VTI - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF
* SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF
* VUG - Vanguard Growth ETF
* AVGV - Avantis All Equity Markets Value ETF

1. What is the % allocations I should have for each?
2. Should I also consider buying stocks, ex: Nvidia, etc.?
3. Strategy to have tax advantaged accounts/tax savings/ability to buy and sell without paying capital gains taxes everytime. Not looking to cashout, but just in case if i needed/wanted to get a different fund for example.
4. I also have 2 kids (toddler and infant) that I want to start investing for them in separate accounts. Considering they won't be touching this money for say 18 years, what funds should I consider for them?
5. How or where can I open accounts for them? I was looking at using Fidelity for myself"
"21 yo and started investing in Europe In first I chose 2 ETFs because I believe in start, more simple is the best option, so I did 85/15, thinking on 80/20 but idk already.

I chose VWCE because it is an core ETF, exposed for all world and have less risk.

In other hand, i chose 2B76 wish is like RBOT ETF but here in EU. I chose it not because is a generalist IA ETF, neither because it’s on hype but this etf englobes the best enterprises in robot, chips, in tech of hospital industry and smart houses. I believe that in our society (developed countries) it would be more and more old people and less young, so this is inevitable in long term ETFs like that don’t grow up (in my opinion of course).

I would like to have your opinion of this. It’s important we expand our perspectives."

"What the Heck Are Autocallable ETFs? A Quick Primer Autocallable ETFs are a new arrival in the income ETF space. 

They’re built on autocallable yield notes, which pay income depending on how an equity index behaves. 

The twist is that these ETFs try to deliver high monthly payouts while giving you some downside cushion. 

Until recently, this stuff was mostly locked behind private banks and structured-product desks.

Here’s how the strategy works:

# 1. Income tied to market levels

The notes inside these ETFs pay monthly income as long as the reference index stays above a preset barrier. Usually around 60% of its initial level. So the fund doesn’t rely on bonds, dividends, or selling calls. It’s pure, conditional income.

# 2. Potential for high yields

Because the payouts depend on markets not falling too far, yields can be much higher than typical fixed income or options-income products. In calm or mildly choppy markets, that can create very attractive cash flow.

# 3. Partial downside protection

There’s a buffer. Moderate declines don’t necessarily shut off income. Bigger, sustained drops might pause payments or expose principal at maturity if the index finishes below the barrier.

# 4. Autocalls keep resetting the ladder

Each note has a check point. If the index stays above its original starting level on that date, the note autocalls. That means it ends early and gets replaced. A whole ladder of these notes with staggered resets helps the ETF smooth income through different market environments.

# 5. Why people are paying attention

Autocallable ETFs aim for high income monthly distributions tax efficiency stability in flat or modestly declining markets. They also avoid the old hassles of structured notes. No high minimums, no odd tax forms, and you can trade them daily.

# 6. They’re not risk-free

Sharp market drops can pause income. Breaching the barrier at maturity means principal losses. Autocallables also come with structural risks like contingent income risk, early redemption risk, barrier risk, and counterparty risk.

# 7. Autocallable ETF to Watch

[The Calamos Autocallable Income ETF (CAIE](https://www.etfcentral.com/news/autocallable-yield-advantage-and-market-reception?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=pinnedpost&utm_campaign=Calamos)) gets a lot of attention simply because it launched first and showed there’s real interest in this strategy. It’s not the whole story. More autocallable ETFs are coming. Including versions tied to indexes like QQQ. And the broader theme is that structured-income tools once reserved for private clients are finally making their way into the ETF universe.

[Here's how CAIE Works](https://www.etfcentral.com/news/autocallable-yield-advantage-and-market-reception?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=pinnedpost&utm_campaign=Calamos)

# TLDR:

Autocallable ETFs package structured autocall notes into a simple ETF. They chase high monthly income, include partial downside buffers, and carry tail risks in deep drawdowns. CAIE is just the first example in a category that is likely to expand."
"Unique ETF Allocations With A Pension I am in a unique situation where my retirement is a pension, not a 401k. I will receive 75% of my salary for life. On top of it, if my VA rating gets bumped up to 100 (with P&T), that's another $4,100+ per month, tax free. I know there is a popular 60/40 structure as people approach retirement, but is that really necessary for someone in my situation?

I'm thinking about skipping bonds or an ETF like SCHD completely. I currently have SPYM as my core at 25%. I also have FTEC at 25%, SOXQ at 25%, and SCHG at 25%. I know that is very tech heavy, but we are in the AI, Quantum, Data Center phase right now. I'll adjust later if things start taking a major downturn. I know my gamble is risky. I accept that.

What other suggestions would y'all have for someone who will get a pension + VA benefits that will more than cover the retirement cost of living?"

"Has anyone tested a long term DCA strategy combining VOO, VTI and gold? I ran a small 10 year test. Not financial advice just sharing something I’ve been studying.

I wanted to see what happens if someone invests **50 USD per month** consistently from 2015 to 2025 without trying to time the market.

So I tested a simple three pillar model:

• Broad index ETFs like **VOO / VTI**  
• **Gold** (physical and GLD)  
• A small allocation to BTC/ETH

No trading.  
No leverage.  
Just monthly DCA.

Here’s what stood out:

• VOO/VTI grew slow but incredibly stable  
• Gold surprisingly helped during inflation spikes and rate hikes  
• Crypto had the highest long term CAGR even with huge drawdowns  
• But the **combined portfolio** had the best balance of risk and return

Not saying this is the perfect strategy but the test made me appreciate how simple, diversified systems can outperform guessing.

Curious if anyone here has done similar long term tests."

"Beginner looking for ETF feedback Hey everyone

I’m completely new to investing and I’m trying to build my first long-term strategy using DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging). My goal isn’t to trade or constantly move things around — just invest consistently with a 20–30+ year horizon.

After researching for a while, I came up with this portfolio of accumulating ETFs:

* **CSPX (S&P 500)** — 50%
* **CNDX (Nasdaq 100)** — 20%
* **SMH (Semiconductors)** — 15%
* **EIMI (Emerging Markets)** — 15%

**My reasoning:**

* CSPX as a strong and stable global core.
* CNDX and SMH as overweight exposure to tech growth.
* EIMI for some diversification outside the US.

I plan to start by investing **$150 USD** per month and gradually increase contributions over time, letting compounding do its thing in the long run.

**What do you think about this allocation for someone starting out?**  
I’m open to all feedback — advice, warnings, or even constructive roasting haha"

"Understanding VBIL vs SGOV When comparing VBIL and SGOV, VBIL on paper seems like the clear winner. Lower ER and therefore a higher yield. But, when comparing the two over the past 6 months (trying to eliminate growing pains for VBIL), SGOV seems to have a better total return over the majority of start dates picked. Why is this? I know both Vanguard and Blackrock lend securities in order to lower expenses, is Blackrock just better at doing this and that explains the difference? Or is just a matter of the random market fluctuations and the days I am picking as a start date are determining SGOV having the edge over VBIL? Unfortunately, VBIL is new so I cannot compare multiple years of performance that smooths out irregularities.

I know the difference between the two is negligible, this just confuses me and I’m interested in learning why this is. I read through SGOVs prospectus and didn’t see anything that would explain this.

**Context**

My Dad has been investing for 30 years and now he is unable to continue self-managing his portfolio. I convinced my Mom to give me a 1 year trial period to prove I can handle it. If I don't manage the portfolio, my Mom will go with a 0.7% AUM fully managed plan through Fidelity. Our advisor said they typically ""hug the benchmark"" net-of-fees by using tax loss harvesting and active tilts. I figured why not try to implement a bootleg version of TLH and active tilts myself to potentially get a small boost  and save the 0.7% fee. I estimated my parents will likely need a withdrawal rate of ~5% for the next couple of years but I have reason to believe this could drop to ~3% in the medium term. While their expenses remain high, I'm recommending a 60/40 stock/bond allocation with a total bond fund in the IRA and some municipal bond funds in taxable. I went a little overboard and made a spreadsheet where I can input ~10 metrics from MorningStar and it tells me how to apply small active tilts to the overall stock/bond allocation, the overall US/international allocation, US small-cap value/US total market, US momentum/US total market, etc. etc. I figure if it turns out to be a dumb idea, or just too much work, I can just sell the factor funds and go with 70/30 FZROX/FZILX. I recently discovered the Avantis funds of funds (e.g., AVGE). I wonder if I should just go with 70% FZROX/FZILX 30% AVGE in the IRA and call it a day. Also, if you have any recommendations for the bond funds that'd be great too."

"Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard or something else? Plus, general recommendation regarding ETFs, please. In 40s. Thank you! Hello everybody. 

So, I've just got into investing. I'm 40 and I'm looking at long term investing, like 20 years. I want to have some money when I retire. Probably late, but still, I can have something.

I don't have much money. I've started with $5000(bought VOO) and I'm planning on investing a minimum of $1000 per month in the same VOO for 20 years. That's what I've come up with after some research. 

I chose Schwab(also per my research) as I've heard good things about Ameritrade, which is now Schwab. But after my initial investment I faced a problem. I want to invest the whole $1000 per month in VOO, but Schwab doesn't allow that. They only allow to buy a full share. And I don't really want to invest per share. I want to invest the whole $1000. 

1) Can you please recommend a company that I can move to, so that I could invest a certain amount of money in VOO and not only share by share? Also, no fees and the lowest expenses possible.
I've heard that I can do it with Fidelity or Vanguard. But I figured I better ask this time. You might know better what will suit me based on my plan above.

2) If you could recommend a second good ETF in addition to VOO and how much to invest in it in percentage between VOO and the second ETF, that would be great! 

Any additional advice is always welcome! 

Thank you!"

"A Comment on VOO/VTI/VT and “Chilling” Hey, if anyone has been on this sub long enough, they will probably come across a top comment along the lines of “just invest 100% in VOO/VTI/VT and chill!”

While this is probably pretty solid advice if one is into a one-fund approach, I wanted to do a write-up and share the little knowledge and thoughts I have regarding all this. There is also broadly the question of which of these three is right for you (as for reasons that will become apparent, it doesn't make sense to invest in more than one of these three).

First of all, Reddit has a Vanguard bias for some reason. While VOO is a great fund, I think it is worth mentioning that SPYM is a great alternative to track the same thing. As for VTI, SCHB is a good alternative should you not want to buy into Vanguard. Always consider expense ratios when buying ETFs because small differences will add up in the long run.

Secondly, it’s also worth noting that investing in a bond ETF like SGOV or BND can be beneficial as you age, because it adds stability to your portfolio at the expense of some growth as you near retirement. The “120 rule” suggests subtracting your age from 120 to determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be invested in equities, with the rest allocated to bonds. For instance, if you’re 30 years old, you would invest 90 percent in VT (as an example) and the remaining 10 percent in SGOV.

Broadly though, we should appreciate what each of these three Vanguard funds does. VOO tracks large-cap companies in the United States, specifically the S&P 500. This is a good way to buy into the largest companies in the United States and really invest in the benchmark for how the United States is doing. Investing in the S&P 500 started as a broad strategy to diversify your portfolio. If you imagine it’s 2000 and you were to pick and choose what companies to invest in, you could pick Apple and buy stock in what would end up being one of the most successful companies in the world, but you could have also bought into Enron and gone bust. By buying into a diversified portfolio, you are buying into the collective wisdom of the market.

Okay, next the question is: what about the companies outside the top 500? Well, you can invest in the total US stock market with VTI. However, keep in mind these funds are weighted by market capitalization (meaning the bigger the company, the more it represents in the portfolio). For that reason, you should think of VOO as making up roughly 85% of VTI. With VTI, you are buying into the other 2,500+ companies to further diversify your portfolio.

Finally, what about international? Well, VT is VTI plus stocks from all over the world. VTI specifically makes up roughly 60% of VT, so think of VT as your option if you want to diversify with stocks from outside the US.

Now, VTI and VT, in Vanguard’s wisdom, have divided these percentages up as they did, but you are free to make a three-fund portfolio and pick and choose as you wish. VTWO, Vanguard's Russell 2000 ETF, tracks the mid- and small-cap companies that are added to VOO to make VTI (more or less, of course). VXUS is Vanguard’s Total International Stock ETF, which more or less is the 40% added to VTI to make VT.

One misconception is that choosing VOO, VTI, or VT eliminates judgment. In reality, selecting among them *is* a judgment call. If you believe (what may very well be the case) that more diversification is always the safest option when investing long-term (10 or 20 or 30 years), VT might be the right option. However, there is reason to believe US large-cap companies will outperform mid/small caps and/or the international market. Of course, the opposite may be true. With the looming supposed AI bubble, mid- and small-cap companies may prove more valuable. Or, if you (for what I personally believe is an erroneous belief) think the US will step away as the leader of business on the world stage in the next 10/20/30 years, you may wish to invest more in international stocks.

There is no universally correct answer. Each fund reflects a different worldview about how markets may evolve and how much diversification you value.



Edit/Addendum:

Hey, just wanted to add this to respond to a lot of general comments. I do find it a little funny that multiple people are complaining that the post is too long and they didn’t read it but are sharing their thoughts anyway. Nobody is forcing you to read what I wrote, so just ignore the post if you don’t want to read it.

Regardless, **TL;DR: I’ve noticed on the sub that the common advice given is to invest 100% in a single broad-market ETF like VOO, VTI, or VT and “chill.” If you didn’t know: VOO tracks the 500 largest U.S. companies; VTI tracks VOO plus U.S. mid- and small-cap companies (VOO is ≈ 85% of VTI); and VT tracks the entire world supposedly (VTI is ≈ 60% of VT). There is no “no-brainer” option, and selecting one of these is a decision about your view of how different sectors of the economy will perform and how much you want to hedge your assumptions by further diversifying.**

With that TL;DR out of the way, I think some people are confused and asking what fund I would recommend then, which is beside the point. The truth is I don’t know whether in 10/20/30 years VOO, VTI, or VT will outperform the others, and nobody can say with confidence which will. Granted, as others have pointed out, going 100% into any of these will most likely yield you a strong return in a couple of decades, so in that sense you can’t go wrong. However, some are taking that fact and running with the idea that I am overthinking it, which sure might be the case because going 100% into any of these three options would all be good ideas. Nevertheless, going in on one ETF for the foreseeable future (and possibly through retirement) is a huge decision that I personally think warrants consideration beyond someone coming and asking a specific investment question and getting a platitude response without much further explanation. I think if someone takes the time to come to this subreddit and ask a question, they may be interested in a more thoughtful explanation.

Regardless of whether you pick VOO, VTI, or VT, you are betting (I hate using that word because it makes investing sound like gambling, which it isn’t, but regardless the verbiage explains the point) that large-cap companies in the U.S. will grow and succeed over the extended future. By investing in VTI, you are, in a certain sense, hedging that bet by bringing in mid- to small-cap companies that potentially could outperform in certain years and make your portfolio stronger in the long run. With VT, you are hedging the same way but with international companies.

If you do your own research, you can pick different funds and form your own portfolio based upon how diversified you want to be. Simplicity is generally key, but going 100% into any of these three funds, while a good investment in my opinion, is not your only option."
"SGOV vs. VBIL SGOV and VBIL look very similar to me. VBIL costs less and it has a lower share price, but it also looks like it pays less? Is that because VBIL is so new? Or because it looks like that fund invests in AAA bonds as opposed to SGOV's investment grade bonds? I was ready to move money from FZDXX to SGOV and then I saw VBIL and was curious."
"Is momentum a compensated risk? Carhart's four factor model lists momentum as a factor of excess returns. But I don't see anyone suggesting momentum ETFs for portfolios. With small cap value ETFs like AVUV, they get the community recommendation just below broad market ETFs like VTI/VXUS. So why are momentum ETFs(SPMO/MTUM) not looked at in a similar light?"
Taxable Brokerage Account ETF dividends - taxed annually at ordinary income or long term capital gains? My CPA (in California) just told me our holdings are being taxed as ordinary income annually on the Vanguard 1099. She said some ETFs's annual dividends are taxed at Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) rates (20%) and some at ordinary income rates (higher rate). I am only learning this now. Is this accurate? So should I be looking for ETFs that would have the annual dividends taxed at the capital gains rate? Where do I find those and how do I know which they are?

"Hey guys, I wanted your opinion on my investing strategy for the next 5 years. I’m planning to invest $20,000 upfront + $1,500 every month into a 3-ETF portfolio:
	•	40% VOO
	•	30% QQQM
	•	30% VGT

My goal is higher growth rather than income/dividends, and I’m okay with market volatility as long as the long-term outcome is strong.

Do you think this allocation is too risky, or is it a reasonable strategy for aggressive growth over a 5-year horizon?
Would you adjust it or keep it as is?

I appreciate any feedback."
"I’m 21 and about to invest $1.875M… thoughts on this ETF combo? Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some honest input because my life just changed pretty dramatically and I’m trying really hard not to screw anything up. My business recently landed a multi-million-dollar contract and my personal payout from it is going to be about $1,875,000. I’m only 21, so I’m doing everything I can to handle this responsibly instead of getting stupid with it.

I’m already in the process of hiring a fiduciary financial advisor, but before I finalize anything I wanted to hear what people here think. I’ve been researching different long-term strategies and one idea that keeps coming back to me is putting the money into a combination of VOO, SCHD and JEPI. Basically the idea is half in VOO for long-term growth, a chunk in SCHD for dividend stability, and the remaining part in JEPI for monthly income. It seems like a good mix of growth, quality and cash flow, especially at my age, but I’m definitely open to being told I’m wrong.
Since I’m still learning I’m just trying to sanity-check a few things. Does this kind of allocation make sense for someone my age or is it too conservative or too aggressive? Is JEPI something that people here actually trust long term? I’m highly considering investing it all at once, as I know that’s usually the best long term route. 

I know Reddit isn’t a replacement for a professional, but I really value hearing from people who have been investing for years and have seen both good and bad markets. I want to set myself up so that future me looks back and is thankful I didn’t make any dumb decisions with this blessing.
Any thoughts or experiences are appreciated.

EDIT: This is post tax income."

"officially giving up on picking stocks. you guys win tried to be a ""trader"" for the last year. watched hours of youtube, drew lines on charts, stressed out every single morning.

just did the math and im literally down money. meanwhile my friend who knows absolutely nothing about finance just buys vti every month and is up.

actually hurts my ego lol. anyway deciding to swallow my pride. selling all my random individual stocks tomorrow morning and dumping it into vti and maybe some vxus.

guess im officially boring now. hope the peace of mind is worth it cause i am tired of having heart attacks over earnings reports. just wanted to vent to people who get it."
"finally accepted i am not warren buffett. sold my individual stocks and went 100% VOO honest to god, i feel like a weight is off my shoulders.

for the last 2 years i have been trying to pick stocks. watching youtube videos, reading earnings reports (that i barely understood lol), and checking my phone like 40 times a day. even at work i’d be sneaking to the bathroom to check if my tech stocks were crashing.

looked at my total return yesterday and realized after all that stress and ""research,"" i was basically flat. actually probably down if you count inflation.

woke up today, sold the random junk i was holding, and dumped it all into VOO. i know it’s basic. i know it’s ""boring."" but knowing i don't have to babysit my money anymore feels amazing.

gonna delete the trading app from my phone and just auto-invest from now on.

"Fraudulent vote for QQQ I received a letter from Schwab confirming my QQQ votes.  The problem is, I  had voted differently than was shown.  Someone used my control number to cast a vote on my behalf.  I double checked my vote and I believe my vote had overwritten this fraudulent vote that was cast earlier.  This is a ""Telephone voting confirmation"" so, presumably happened over the phone.  Schwab was no help on this and I don't have time to try to contact ProxyVote to sort this out.   

The Schwab letter appears legit because the control number is correct and it doesn't offer any contact info, which would defeat the purpose of any scam.

Whether you voted or not, might want to check your votes."
"SCHG I’d like some of the community’s thoughts on SCHG as a core holding in their portfolio. 

For reference, this is in a taxable, “fun money” account that has a 5-10 year timeline, and takes up approximately 60% of the portfolio. My main concern is that I simply just won’t beat the market over that time. I guess I’m just wondering if the concerns are valid."

"Beginner Plan Hello all,

Just graduated from college, and am looking to set up my financials with both a Roth IRA & brokerage. After some research, here is the plan I am leaning towards, and I wanted to see if there were any problems. I plan to hold/not sell both until retirement but I would sell some of the brokerage if needed earlier.

Roth IRA: (max out yearly in 1-2 deposits early in the year)
- 60% VOO
- 30% QQQM
- 10% SCHG

Is the SCHG pointless? Should I just stick with the first two? I am a little concerned with only having US stocks & tech being the big focus but that does seem to be the most used combo. Was debating introducing VXUS otherwise.

Brokerage: (deposit portion of every paycheck & all non-emergency fund savings, not sure how much yet)
- VXUS
- VTI
- QQQM

Haven’t decided on percentages for that yet. Was hoping for some insight on how I can be smart with my brokerage investments. Thank you!"
Is EMIM worth adding if VWRP already gives me emerging markets? I hold VWRP as my core fund and EMIM as a small satellite. VWRP already has about 10 to 11 percent in emerging markets.

"Opinion on my ETF portfolio as a Spanish investor + doubts about dividends Hey everyone,
I’m 24yo and wanted to get some feedback on my current portfolio. Right now I’m investing 500 EUR every month in:
	•	200 EUR → VWCE
	•	150 EUR → SXR8 (S&P 500)
	•	150 EUR → SXRV (MSCI World Quality)

Income: 2,800 EUR net/month.

Everything is accumulating now… but my long-term goal is to live off dividends. That’s where I’m confused.

My doubts:

1. Currency confusion:
VOO shows +15% YTD online, but my UCITS ETFs like VUAA/SXR8 only show ~4–5% in Trade Republic.
I think it’s because VOO is in USD and UCITS are in EUR, but I’d love someone to explain it clearly.

2. Dividends in the future:
Should I already add a dividend ETF like:
VHYL / VIGI / SPYD / SCHD equivalent in Europe (e.g., IQQY, ZPRA, IEDY, etc.) or recoment best one.

Or is it better to stay fully in accumulating ETFs (VWCE + SXR8 + SXRV) and much later sell and switch to distributing ETFs when I actually need the income? 

I’m worried about selling in the future because I don’t want a huge tax bill.

Any thoughts from other EU / Spanish investors on this strategy?"
"One of these 4 ETFs has to go — which would you drop? Hey all,

I’m 36yo building a long-term portfolio and currently have 4 ETFs that I’m invested in. But I’ve realized this setup might be a bit redundant, so I want to simplify and cut one. ( I got one suspect…)

Here’s my current allocation:
	•	60% VT – total global market exposure
	•	20% SCHG – U.S. growth stocks (large-cap)
	•	10% SPMO – S&P 500 momentum
	•	10% QQQM – NASDAQ-100 (tech-heavy)

I know there’s some overlap here (especially between SCHG, QQQM, and even SPMO), so I’m thinking one of these needs to go.

My goal: a long-term, reasonably simple portfolio with some growth tilt.

"38M planning to invest 400k mid - long term Hi,

I have 400k that I’m planning to invest on a safe way, I thought about 60% VOO / 30% QQQ and maybe the remaining 10% GOOG / NVDA / VISA.

Idea is to invest minimum 3-5 years but ideally longer

I also have 150k in eth but I’m planning not using that, been holding it for 4 years.

Aside from that I have other 300k in savings that I’m using as a backup.

Been investing 10k in VOO / QQQ to learn a bit about how everything works / manage my emotions, but planning to do a bigger move.

P.S: I’m on the US for 3 years more, then I can either update my visa or move to Europe , from what I readed that shouldn’t be an issue with Interactive Brokers long term investing?

Thoughts?

Thanks!"
"SGOV & dividend growth I want to purchase SGOV and start parking money there instead of in my MMA (FZDXX). I was reading a little and saw SGOV has a dividend growth of -19.64% and I'm not sure exactly what that means. Is that because the fund is short-term T-bills and as the older ones mature and newer ones are purchased to replace them, the interest rate at the time of new purchases in the fund will effect the dividend for the month? So then the dividend growth could swing up or down on a weekly or monthly basis?"

I want to dollar-cost average a few thousand dollars every month into two index ETFs and hold them for at least 10 years.

I originally considered BRK.B because it has less tech exposure, but then I realized BRK.B is a single company, not an ETF. If Berkshire makes a big mistake, the stock could crash.

"Thoughts on an 80/20 global portfolio? Hi everyone,

45 y/o from Spain here. Low expenses but modest and irregular income. I have about 50k euros to invest and will deploy it slowly via DCA. I’m considering a reputable Spanish robo-advisor )Indexa Capital) because it handles automatic rebalancing at low cost.

Based on my profile it recommends an 80 percent stocks / 20 percent bonds portfolio:

* 80% global equities: US, Europe, Japan, Emerging Markets, and global small caps (all low-cost index funds)
* 20%percent global bonds: global government and corporate bonds, EUR-hedged

I could also choose 90/10, 100 percent stocks, or 70/30, but 80/20.

Main questions:

1. Does an 80/20 global allocation make sense for my situation?
2. And most important: Do you like the equity breakdown (US / Europe / Japan / EM / small caps)?

Thanks!"

However my post is about taxable account. I want to make one with a growth tilt and one with an income tilt. My goal is to (hopefully) retire early and to supplement additional income outside of work as (opposed to getting a second job). 

I plan to contribute regularly to both accounts. Here's what I had in mind, please let me know what you think and if you would change/remove anything....

Taxable account #1 - Growth portfolio $100k deposit:

50% VOO or VTI

25% SCHG

25% SCHD or VYM or DGRO

*I was conflicted about moving SCHD/VYM/DGRO to income portfolio and putting international here instead (VYMI or VXUS) but Roth is already VT although I don't really contribute to that. I'm open to suggestions.

"Thoughts on this 4 split portfolio? Hey everyone,

I’m a 36 years old based in Switzerland, just getting serious about long-term investing. I’m ready to build a simple but solid portfolio I can stick with.

I’m planning to invest $50,000 upfront, then $1,000/month via DCA going forward. I’ll be funding it in USD through IBKR. My goal is long-term growth.

Here’s the portfolio split I’m thinking about: •	50% VT – global stock market exposure •	30% QQQM – tech/growth tilt •	10% UTES – for defensive utilities •	10% VHT – health sector I believe in long-term

What do you think? Too much overlap? Is the sector tilt (utilities + health) worth it or overkill when VT already covers everything broadly and should just fuel VT?

Would love thoughts from the community on this structure. Thanks"

Of course I know there will be preferences but for those of you who are invested, what is your favourite ETF and why? 

For a bit of context I believe in Nuclear energy, especially with the energy demand of AI. Probably will allocate 5% or less of my portfolio to this sector and keep the rest between IVV, DHHF, IAA etc. (Australia market).

"As a new investor how worried should i be about a potential ai bubble bursting? So as everyone here i am sure knows all over the news, social media, podcasts, articles people are talking about an ai bubble. When you listen to what they say, it makes sense, should i be investing in value etfs with high dividends instead of growth stock like s&p 500? I understand also, that a lot of you have your entire fortune, lifes saveing or just a large chunk of your wealth betting on it not being a bubble, so the responses might be a little bias. But lets say it is a bubble and 30-40% value gets wiped out, how confident are u that it will bounce back? remember, we are on the verge of ww3 with russia (potentially), we have climate crisis potentially on the cards in our life time and we have in the developed world a growing demographic change on the way. Is endless growth really sustainable or even likely in our lifetimes? Additionally if ai does turn out to be a bubble, doesent that drag down the future .p.a growth numbers across the board, as the averages are blown out by the huge surge in valuation these last few years?

I apreciate i have thrown a lot of questions out there at the moment xD im verry new to this, and im just thinking off the top of my head as write this all, but i have a lot of questions. Im also interested to hear how you guys feel u will react if something does happen, i know people have been building saveings for literally years and years and years here, seeing them wiped out and haveing to rebuild from scratch... brutal."

"Finally left my money manager to DIY with ETFs He was managing all my money for about 9 years and I thought I wasn’t smart enough to do with my money.

"Grayscale Has Filed for the First Ever Spot ZCash (ZEC) ETF Crypto asset manager Grayscale has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to convert its Grayscale Zcash Trust into a spot ZEC exchange-traded fund (ETF).

In a preliminary prospectus dated Nov. 26, Grayscale said it plans to list the fund on NYSE Arca under the ticker ZCSH. The filing names Coinbase Custody as custodian and Coinbase as prime broker. The Bank of New York Mellon will act as transfer agent and administrator of the ETF.

As of Nov. 25, Grayscale Zcash Trust held about 394,400 ZEC, worth around $199.2 million at current market price, per data from Grayscale’s website.

If approved, this would be the first spot Zcash product listed on a U.S. stock exchange, giving Grayscale an early lead in offering ZEC exposure via a vehicle familiar and accessible to traditional and institutional investors.

Grayscale’s plan to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot ETF comes as ZEC has seen a huge surge in price since late September, amid growing investor interest in privacy-focused crypto assets. ZEC is up more than 1,000% in the past three months."

"How do you guys track your total etf allocation when you have multiple accounts? I have three fund portfolios split across three different accounts;

Fidelity 401k has a target date fund that's basically 60/30/10 domestic/international/bonds.

Vanguard IRA has VTI, VXUS, BND in the same ratios.

Schwab taxable has SCHB, VXUS, BND.

Conceptually it's all the same allocation but tracking my actual percentages across three platforms is annoying, each brokerage shows my holdings fine but I can't see my total allocation across all there. So quarterly when I rebalance I have to pull up each account, write down values, calculate percentages manually, figure out where I'm overweight, then decide which account to adjust. It works but takes 30 minutes every time and feels inefficient.

Is everyone doing the manual spreadsheet dance or is there a simpler way? Also want to track performance vs sp500 across my entire portfolio, not just individual accounts, and I only found this app called blossom to aggregate everything but I am curious what other boggleheads use for this."

"It took me 7 years, but the ""Snowball Effect"" is finally real. When I started buying ETFs, it felt like throwing money into a black hole. Buying $500 of VOO here and there didn't seem to move the needle. The dividends were enough to buy… a cup of coffee. It was discouraging watching people get rich on crypto while I was inching along.

But I just did my quarterly review, and for the first time, my portfolio's daily swings are larger than my monthly paycheck.

I know everyone says ""wait for the snowball,"" but actually feeling it gain momentum is a totally different experience. The first few years are a slog, but if you are new here and discouraged: **Don't stop.** The math works if you give it enough time.

Just wanted to say thanks to this sub for keeping me on the straight and narrow path when I wanted to do stupid things with my money."
"SCHG SCHG determines growth by following the Dow Jonex U.S. Total Stock Market Indices ""six factors."" I've researched and asked AI, and here's the answer:

The six factors used to classify stocks as ""growth"" in the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Indices methodology are not specified in the search results. A more detailed search would be required to find the specific factors. However, the methodology confirms the use of a six-factor model to categorize stocks by investment style. 

For context, other S&P Dow Jones factor indices use various metrics related to financial performance, but the exact combination for the Total Stock Market Indices' growth designation is not publicly available in these results.

So, I'm supposed to blindly throw money into SCHG if Technology takes a poo poo, and just trust that ""the six factors"" bails my cheeks out of the septic tank? Does anyone have further information on how SCHG functions?"

Was curious if i should invest even more into VOO or maybe into another fund? hear people speak about QQQ, VT and VTI, and since i’m young i wonder if it would be better to not put it all into VOO for some reason."
Where to invest?? I have some fund saved up as an emergency. Would like to invest that in some ETF or any stock which provides dividends over the year short to long term like monthly or yearly. I have invested in S & P 500 previously like 2-3 years back. Do I continue to build that up? Or shall i choose a different one?

I want to grow my brokerage account enough so that in a decade or so, I can live comfortably and be more financially carefree/independent. 

For my Roth, I’m planning to keep things simple with something like VT or VTI + VXUS. I was also considering a bit more aggressive VOO+AVUV.

But for my taxable brokerage, I’ve been considering taking on more risk. Specifically looking at funds like VGT, QQQM, SMH, SPMO, and VOO, since I strongly believe in long term tech growth.

My questions:
With a 10(ish) year time horizon, am I being unrealistic about riding out a tech downcycle?

Would it be smarter to keep it simple with VOO + AVUV or even VT if my brokerage is meant to help “smooth out life” in the future?

Is it wrong to think of my brokerage as something I might tap occasionally (not drain) for quality-of-life spending? Or should I be saving separately for vacations/house/etc.?"

What makes you choose VOO other than other investments like realestate for example or anything else Hey guys I am new to investing and my goal is early retirement…. I currently have 200k and I am wondering where I should invest them. I am trying to see how things Might turn around if I invest them in VOO for example like 8-13% yearly average maybe? Still I can’t figure out how people actually live off VOO. Do they constantly take profits by selling or they rely on dividends which is not much in my opinion? What’s the plan here? Put 200k in VOO and wait 10 years to make some profits?

"VTI, VOO × DFUS, AVUS, AVLC, AVUQ Quick question: how do you guys think about choosing between the classic Vanguard ETFs (VTI, VOO) and the newer Dimensional / Avantis options (DFUS, AVUS, AVLC, AVUQ)? I’ve been watching Ben Felix’s recent work — especially his video *“Comparing U.S. Equity ETFs: VTI vs. DFUS”* — where he argues that Dimensional’s approach (DFUS) can outperform VTI because it doesn’t blind-track an index.  
  
Here are some stats to highlight the trade-offs:

* **VTI** – Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, **expense ratio \~ 0.03%**
* **DFUS** – Dimensional U.S. Equity ETF, **expense ratio \~ 0.09%**
* **AVUS** – Avantis U.S. Equity, **expense ratio \~ 0.15%**

If we’re comparing like with like:

* **VTI** should be benchmarked against **DFUS** *and* **AVUS**, since all three try to capture the full U.S. market.
* **VOO** (Vanguard S&P 500, **expense ratio \~ 0.03%**) makes more sense to compare with **AVLC** and **AVUQ**. For reference, **AVLC** (Avantis U.S. Large Cap Equity) has an **expense ratio of 0.15%**.
* **AVUQ**, which launched more recently, is called a “Quality ETF” but seems engineered to compete in large-cap growth space (think SCHG, VUG, even QQQ). Its **expense ratio is also 0.15%**, and its holdings are heavily tilted toward high-profitability, large-cap growth names.

So the real question: are you willing to pay a little more in ER to get Dimensional or Avantis’ edge — or stick with Vanguard’s ultra-low cost and tight tracking? What do you all lean toward, and why?

"Does the currency you hold an ETF in matter if you aren't going to spend in it? For instance I know that if you are in the EURO-zone and you hold US stocks in an ETF, it does not matter if you hold them in USD or EUROs since at some point you will be converting the underlying USD value to EUROs to spend, and in the interim it is just a book-keeping exercises whether you track the underlying USD-nominal value in USD or EURO, but what if you live in a country where the investing options do not allow a 'local currency' ETF container of the USD stocks and you are limited to either USD or EURO or CHF or GBP or AUD or CAD etc options where you actually will spend none of those currencies in the future, what do you do then? Does it matter which currency you choose, should you then just stick with the same currency as the underlying assets?"

"honestly i think im done with ""smart"" investing. selling everything for VOO. idk if anyone else feels like this but i am actually losing my mind watching the s&p rip every single day while my ""diversified"" portfolio just sits there doing nothing.

ive been doing the whole boglehead thing for like 3 years now. holding VTI and VXUS and some AVUV because someone on here told me small cap value is the holy grail. well guess what? my friends who literally just bought spy or qqq and forgot about it are absolutely crushing me. like it’s not even close.

i look at my international funds and its just red or flat. everyone says ""oh but valuations are lower overseas"" yeah well maybe they are lower for a reason?? i feel like an idiot betting against amazon and google just to own some random nestle stock or whatever is in vxus.

im seriously considering just selling it all tomorrow and dumping 100% into VOO and deleting the app. i know as soon as i do that the market will crash but i cant take the fomo anymore. seeing 20 year olds on tiktok making 40% returns while im bragging about my 6% ""risk adjusted"" return is painful.

"Has anyone explored ETFs that blend private + public innovation companies? I’ve been noticing that a lot of the big growth happens in private companies way before they ever hit the stock market. So it made me wonder, are there any ETFs that let you get a mix of private companies and early stage public innovators? I ran into XOVR while reading about this. It basically mixes private companies with public innovation stocks using kind of a venture style approach. I’m not promoting it or anything, just curious how these ""hybrid"" ETFs actually work in real life. Do they really add something useful, or is it more of a marketing angle? Would love to hear what people think about ETFs that try to connect private and public markets. Smart idea or just extra noise?"
"Question I’m working on a long-term investing plan (5–10 years) and wanted to get some feedback before I lock it in.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

Initial lump sum: $30,000
Monthly contributions: $1,500

ETFs split 50/30/20:
	•	50% VOO
	•	30% QQQM
	•	20% SCHD

Plus $500/month into individual stocks, rotating between these 10 names (5 one month, the other 5 the next):
NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN
TSLA, META, AMD, ASML, AVGO

From what I’ve calculated using the historical returns of these ETFs + big tech stocks, the blended return comes out somewhere around ~13% annually. Based on that, it looks like the portfolio could end up around:
	•	~$180k after 5 years
	•	~$430k–$475k after 10 years

Does that seem realistic or am I being too optimistic?
Would you change anything in the allocation or the mix between ETFs and individual stocks?

Just trying to sanity-check this before I fully commit"
"An introduction to VTI and write-up about building a portfolio with it. VTI is a total market index fund and It is often viewed as a highly diversified ETF. Its rate of return is similar to VOO but it has less concentration in big tech in exchange for exposure to small companies. I've seen several posts about adding QQQM or VOO to a portfolio with VTI but I advise against that.

Per fidelity's report on VTI, ""Market-cap weighting may expose the strategy to stock- or sector-level concentration risk when a few richly valued companies or sectors power most of the market gains."" This is my issue with adding QQQM or VOO to a portfolio with VTI. The US economy is top-heavy and adding QQQM or VOO to chase growth can backfire as VTI is already composed of 35% big tech. For reference, QQQM is 53% big tech and VOO is 40%.

The popular pairing for VTI is VXUS. VXUS is the total stock market excluding the US. You can decide for yourself how much you want to invest in the US vs the rest of the world. I often see  70% VTI/ 30% VXUS or 80/20 recommended. If you don't want to sweat the ratios of this pairing you can just invest into VT which is the whole world's stock market. VT is roughly 65% US/ 35% international. You can claim the foreign tax credit if you have VXUS on a taxable brokerage account. You cannot claim the foreign tax credit for VT, however. 

If all you have is VTI and VXUS, your portfolio is 100% stocks. How close are you to retiring? If you answer 5 to 10 years, you should not be all in on stocks. This is where the popular ""3-fund portfolio"" comes into play. Bonds, CDs, HYSA, or a money market fund (SPAXX) should be considered because your portfolio has already grown and you want stability as you near retirement. I'll link a video for the 3-fund portfolio in the comments. If you have 15+ years before retiring, you're still in the growing phase of your portfolio so you can afford to be in 100% stocks. However, more prudent investors far away from retirement can opt into bonds, CDs, HYSA, or SPAXX if they want to. 

For first time investors, you should know that time in the market beats timing the market because of compounding interest. HOWEVER, if you're worried about the market short term, you can invest a set amount each month instead of lump sum buying ETFs. This can mitigate risk in a crashing market as opposed to a big lump sum investment.  Investing into VTI and VXUS is a long term investment and you've likely chosen this portfolio because you're in it for the long run. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and stick to your strategy. As the market drops, you get to buy shares of VTI/VXUS for a lower cost. 

Thanks for reading to the end. I tried my best to write up everything that I wish someone would have told me when I first started investing. If you feel that I stated something incorrect, please speak up."

I’m a 36-year-old guy, originally from the EU but living in Switzerland for a few years now. I recently got into investing — I started by putting around $20,000 USD into individual stocks (probably too many…), and I’m already thinking I’ll start trimming those down.

Now I want to invest another $20,000 into index funds with a long-term growth mindset. I also plan to contribute $1,000 per month going forward.

Even though I live in Switzerland, I’ll be funding these investments in **USD** (via IBKR).

Here’s where I’m at:

* I’m a Swiss resident using IBKR.
* I’m new to ETFs and index investing but eager to learn.
* I have medium risk tolerance and I’m not concerned about daily fluctuations.
* My long-term goal is to build a safer, globally diversified portfolio that grows steadily — ideally something set-and-forget.

Here’s my current ETF shortlist:

# What I need help with:

* Which of these are redundant or overlapping? Which one(s) would you go for? Sometjing else you'd reccomend instead?
* Are any of them not optimal for a Swiss resident using IBKR (funded in USD)?
* Should I combine global exposure + S&P 500 + NASDAQ 100, or just go broad?
* Is IAUM worth it as a small gold hedge?
* What would be a reasonable number of ETFs to hold for simplicity but solid coverage?

I’m really aiming to build something I can hold long-term without worrying too much about short-term swings — just steady, global growth with some conviction in U.S. and tech performance.

Thanks so much for any input! I’m trying to shift from stock picking to long-term powerful investing."

"☹️ Is SCHD Dead? Is SCHD dead in your opinion or is it just a bad market environment for value dividend ETFs? I remember when SCHD was the rave with a 3-4% yield and good performance (I think at one point beat VOO) but now it’s been flat and a lot of people still own it. I’m assuming it’s for the high dividend. 

Wouldn’t they be better off with like a VOO, SPYM, SCHG, etc with higher total returns overall and growth potential?"

I always find myself going back to $DIVO when volatility spikes in the market.  This ETF is well diversified, offers a nice starting yield and offers some downside protection during red days due to the covered call overlay on indv. positions.

  
I find myself buying $DIVO during crazy market times as sort of a ""sleep well at night"" ETF.  What ETFs do you find yourself leaning on during volatility?"
"Thoughts on Quantum Computing (QTUM ETF)...looking to diversify more w/ ETFs i'm about 8+ years into my investing endeavors (early 30s now). started out only investing in stocks i liked such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. then slowly transitioned to really just focusing on VOO and set up a reoccurring investment on that over time that continues to grow.

i'm not educated enough to invest in individual stocks so much, but i've been reading more and more about Quantum Computing lately and figured it might be a good time to diversify a little and invest more in a QC ETF such as QTUM. am i overthinking this or would you say this seems like a fair longterm investment to also set up a small reoccurring investment in. definitely missed the Ai trend so looking more ahead now.

appreciate thoughts and feedback!"

My plan looks like this: 

- 60% goes into MSCI ACWI,
- 20% into individual stocks,
- and that leaves me with 20% that I’d like to put into something a bit less obvious.

Any ETFs worth checking out? Could be thematic, sector-specific, or focused on some niche markets."
Question here Which is better for growth in a portfolio DGRO or SPMO for a 30 year investment?
Is SPMO 'conceptually redundant' if you own individual stocks? I got into individual stocks which seems to provide plenty of momentum on their own. Now I wonder whether SPMO has a role for me. Seems like that money might be better allocated toward a defensive ETF to counter individual stock volatility. Does that sound reasonable?
"How Did I Do Relatively new to investing but put a fair amount of research into my portfolio. I know there's a little overlap but just wanted to get a sense of what I could do differently from more experienced folks out there.

QQQM - 10%
GLD - 10%
VBR - 5%
BND - 5%

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!"

Does it really matter if you have $50k of X and $50k of Y instead of one $100k of one or the other?

"Opinions about SCHG instead of NASDAQ 100 for a growth ETF So here is the thing. I am 34, and right now I only invest in VOO, and have been doing that for a couple of years.

I know I will never have the risk tolerance to buy individual stocks, but I have always wanted a two ETF portfolio.

1. S&P 500
2. Some kind of growth ETF (which I do not have yet)

When it comes to the growth ETF, I know a lot of people suggest QQQ, but I just cannot wrap my head around why the Nasdaq 100 is even an index. It feels really arbitrary, and on top of that it excludes financials. People who like the Nasdaq 100 say that is a feature, but for me, not having financial companies is a big drawback.

So, getting back to the original question:

Could I go wrong with SCHG as my growth ETF? The idea is basically to contribute to these two and hold until retirement. 

I have heard a lot of good things about SCHG, but I am not sure if there are any caveats that I do not know about that could be a dealbreaker, kind of like how QQQ does not have financial companies."

Considering I am just getting into investing in my 30s. I am looking to put into something and retire in the next 10-15 years."

In general, my goal is to invest enough money that I wouldn't have to work nearly as much at my part time job once I return for the spring semester, for reference I make about $400 per month (I work one 5-8 hour shift a week, my hourly wage is just high as fuck) and obviously I don't expect to make that back in full with only $2000 in the stock market but that's just what I hope to get to one day. 

What stocks/etf's would y'all recommend investing in next? I'm fine with riskier ones (peep the VGT) I'm just looking for something that has a good return rate in the long term or would y'all recommend just continuing to invest in the stocks I mentioned above? 

Open to any form of USEFUL advice (just don't be a prick please).

"Is it optimal for me to ""sin""? AI ETFs and whether I should buy. I've been thinking about asset allocation for a while. I'm getting pretty annoyed at the results of those ideas. I thought myself above those ideas, and still do. Those ideas are leading me to places I would call a classic folly at a first glance. 

*The idea was that the efficient portfolio for me, as a white collar worker (non physical work), might actually overweight AI stocks.*

I know. Overweighing growth stocks is a ""sin"" to me, as I have already posted in my profile. But I should ask anyways, if not just for the learning opportunity.

The standard financial theory advice on human capital is pretty clear: treat it like a bond of steady returns in the future. If you work in tech, you generally shouldn't overweight tech stocks because you don't want to double down on your risk. If the sector crashes, you lose your job and your portfolio tanks at the same time. There's an implicit idea that job correlations and the market/sector are positive.

That makes sense when your future income and stock prices are moving together. But I'm stuck on what happens if they move in opposite directions. 

If we assume there's a real chance AI becomes a substitute for knowledge work quickly rather than not progressing that fast (or even the appearance of something like a singularity, which I do think is at least plausible, but not necessary here), my future earnings are effectively ""short"" the tech sector. If the technology gets good enough to replace me, the value of the companies owning the models goes up, but my wages go to zero or just much lower.

(*Implicit idea here that it could replace my work. I justify this by appealing to the vast majority of experts thinking this is plausible, including the top experts, and the stuff I've read on LLM capabilities (would not consider myself an expert of course). I am willing to debate this point.*)

In that case, wouldn't the rational move be to actually overweight the sector that threatens my job?

I'm thinking of it like an hedge. If I stick to VT and my factor tilts, I've got market weighted exposure (plus a tilt away from AI), which may not be enough or as high as AI stock returns to offset a permanent loss of wages. Say I tilt heavily into the sector:

----> 1. If AI is a bust, my tilt underperforms, but I keep my job and high wages. I pay a premium for the ""insurance"" in the form of lower portfolio returns.

----> 2. If AI works and displaces me (which I consider possible since the market seems to think it is possible), the portfolio concentration will pay off well (compared to the rest of the market).

*Of course, it isn't certain that either of these things will happen, but I'm working off of expected values and probabilities, so I still think this hedge may apply and that it seems to reduce the variance of my outcomes.*

Is the idiosyncratic risk of concentrating in one sector just too high to justify this kind of hedge? I feel like it's possible, but idk. 

Really not interested in FOMO and stuff; this is purely based on the theory. I have always followed financial theory and empirical evidence to their logical conclusions, so this particular thought is really annoying but very interesting to me, given that it seems contradictory to everything else I know. 

Seems tedious to add citations since I made a lot of claims but I do have them. Please ask about whichever claim you are interested in and I'll try to reply with my citations."

"INVESTING STRATEGY ( EUROPEAN ) Hi all,

just here to share my new investing strategy, I've started 7-8 months ago investing seriously on IBKR.  
at the beginning after studying and researching ( asking also here on reddit ) I ve came out with this strategy :  
70 % VWCE  
20 % MEUD  
10 % IB1C

althought is a simple and in my opinion good strategy, I ve decided to change after more research, I was not comfortable with the extremely high exposure in the US with VWCE ( 60 % ) that s the reason of adding MEUD to it, but doing that there is an extremely amount of overlapping with the two funds.  
For this reasons I ve decide to change strategy still investing in the whole world but with more control on it, adding also some gold to it to diversify even more :

41 % SXR8  
31 % EXUS  
8 % IS3N  
11 % EUNA  
9 % 4GLD

With this I can control independently USA, ex USA and EM, the TER is also better going from a 0.18  to an average of 0.13 %, I ve increased the number of asset that means also increasing the commission x trade but I m comfortable with it ( 0.05 % commission for buying ).  
In this moment I decided to put 20 % on BONDS and GOLD due to the overvalued market, but in the following years I will rebalance with a 90 % stock assets since I m young and all this is for long term.  
Many people here would just say to invest just in an world etf and chill but personally I m not comfortable in an extremely exposure on the usa market ( especially tech market ), I still have 41 % that is still a lot, but with this strategy I can easily rebalance everything.

Let me know what do you guys think :)"

"The Rally and Inevitable Crash of SPY in Early 2026 Markets are heavily influenced by shifts in collective sentiment. The coming 100 days are expected to feature a classic sentiment cycle ending in heavily accelerating fear.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, serves as a proxy for the broaded U.S. equity market. This outlook incorporates the original analysis of a near-term bear-trap rally driven by post-Nvidia capitulation, culminating in a year-end advance. However, this constructive phase is expected to prove unsustainable. A sharp reversal, that could be characterized as a crash, should materialize in February-March, triggered by disappointing corporate earnings revelations and a sectoral rotation toward higher-yield opportunities, such as biopharma, where recent results have demonstrated robust momentum. This dynamic reflects not only fundamental divergences but also classic behavioral extremes.

Markets remain a sentiment-driven construct, where price discovery is often less about intrinsic value than collective perception. The anticipated November bear trap, modeled as an inverted cup formation, exploits this by engineering maximum stress to flush weak capital, paving the way for a rebound. I maintain a year-end 2025 target for the index in the close vicinity of \~6,800. I view any breach of the \~6,550 level as highly unlikely over the next few months, as the combination of strong corporate earnings growth and AI favorable policies should continue to provide a firm foundation for growth.

Nvidia's blowout results have quelled near-term fears, shifting market psychology from cautious optimism to unbridled enthusiasm. This will draw sidelined capital, extending crowded long positioning and suppressing volatility.

Near-term, I anticipate a brief pullback soon following Nvidia’s quarterly results. This move is likely to be driven by profit-taking and a temporary overshoot in retail positioning after the shorty runup. The resulting move should create an emotional capitulation point among late-cycle retail participants, offering an attractive entry opportunity for institutional buyers ahead of the expected year-end rally. The early-December low will mark the point of maximum perceived risk and minimum actual risk. This behavioral extreme historically transfers ownership from impatient to patient capital and sets the stage for a strong advancing stage. Technically, the structure eyes a seamless grind higher, defending the 6,550 monthly floor (200-day MA confluence) without testing it. Short-covering and year-end rebalancing propel SPY to \~6,800 by December 31. Looking into 2026, I expect a strong January-February upside follow-through. However, I remain cautious on the sustainability of gains beyond these months, as valuation multiples are extended and several indicators suggest diminishing marginal returns. By Q2, the rally exhausts with tariff induced margin erosion and sharply de-accelerating demand eroding the AI growth narrative. Technically, the reversal targets 6,000–6,200.

Biopharma's allure intensifies the rotation: November earnings have showcased resilience, with sector-wide beats and upward revisions. Tailwinds include AI-driven discovery (51% executive priority), GLP-1 expansions, and M&A ($80B YTD), projecting 4.5% CAGR revenue growth through 2029, outpacing S&P ex-healthcare. At historic P/E lows, biopharma draws value-seeking flows (e.g., XBI ETF up 8.8% YTD), eroding SPY's healthcare weight (\~12%) and exacerbating downside. The parallel movement of iShares Biotechnology ETF and SPY in November supports the rotation hypothesis.

In summary, the anticipated year-end and Q1 of 2026 advance represents the final euphoric stage of the post-2022 cycle. I expect the S&P 500 (SPY) to complete its 2022–2025 bull market with a powerful but terminal rally through year-end 2025 and early 2026, followed by a sharp reversal in Q1–Q2 2026.

A brief post-Nvidia pullback in early December will mark the final capitulation low, creating an attractive risk/reward entry for institutions. Supported by short covering, seasonal rebalancing, and returning sidelined capital, SPY is projected to reach approximately 6,800 by December 31, 2025, with follow-through into the low 7,000s in January–February 2026. The 6,550 zone is expected to act as a firm floor throughout this phase.

In february-march, the rally is viewed as unsustainable and margin pressure, decelerating AIrelated capital expenditure, and broader demand exhaustion will be revealed. Concurrently, persistent rotational flows into undervalued biopharma and healthcare sectors will erode market breadth and leadership concentration. The combination is expected to trigger a rapid risk-off episode, with downside targets of 6,000–6,200."

"Long-term Tech/AI/Semiconductor ETF portfolio using USD Irish UCITS (via Interactive Brokers) – feedback appreciated Hi everyone, I’m building a long-term ETF portfolio (10–20 years) and I’m focusing on a simple structure of three USD-denominated Irish UCITS ETFs, all held through Interactive Brokers.

The main reasons for choosing Irish UCITS in USD are:

They automatically reinvest dividends (Acc)

They benefit from 15% internal withholding tax on dividends (vs. 30% for U.S.-domiciled ETFs)

Stronger long-term compounding thanks to lower drag

Full USD exposure without the need for currency-hedged share classes

Easy and efficient execution through IBKR

The three ETFs I’m considering are:

50% – iShares S&P 500 Information Technology UCITS (Acc) – ISPY / IUAP

30% – Xtrackers Artificial Intelligence & Big Data UCITS (Acc) – XAIX

20% – VanEck Semiconductor UCITS ETF

My goal is to capture long-term megatrends (AI, cloud, data, software, semiconductors) in a simple “core + satellites” structure:

IT (50%) → quality mega-cap tech core

AI & Big Data (30%) → high-growth satellite

Semiconductors (20%) → structural backbone of AI and computing

Questions:

1. Does the 50/30/20 allocation make sense for long-term risk/return?
2. Would you pick different ETFs in these three categories?
3. Any concentration risks I should be aware of?
4. For semiconductors, would you prefer XSMH/CSEM or U.S. options like SOXX/SMH?
5. Any thoughts on using Interactive Brokers for Irish UCITS in USD (pros/cons), or is it essentially the same across brokers?

Thanks in advance for your insights — really appreciate it.

"Private Trader - The skews, the bait, the switch Alrighty, here we go!

**The downward skew**

Many weeks ago in previous posts, I stated I'm in the zone of crypto being a on downward/negative skew, and that I initiated a position within an ETF that focuses on this negative skew. Many weeks in, crypto has indeed gone down significantly (approx -30%) and I exited my ETF position a few days ago at profit. 

The purpose here wasn't to bank profit, even though thats an ultimate goal, the purpose was to test an equation, an equation I never deployed onto the crypto-sphere. When I decided to exit, I felt that I've reached a point in the equation where holding longer could be detrimental, as it would mean inviting further unknowns and potential ""shakes"" that the equation was not ready to handle, for many reasons, but foremost, its reached the point of maximum validity where the highest percentage of a safe-exit-with-profit has occurred. 

The position itself held low weight, purposefully so, and now having it closed, provided profit of low value, yet data of extremely high value. Data that is now used to further develop another equation, picking pieces of the decayed previous, and building anew onto the next.

**What is this next?**

Quite simply, GOLD. 

Many weeks ago, I also shared that I was significantly invested into gold mining stocks, to the tune of approx 20% of my entire portfolio; and having had that investment skyrocket, decided to sell that entire portion to lock in my profits, as in my eyes, locking them in is the commission I charge using my realized-capital-efficiency approach; more on that in a bit.

I have now taken multiple ETF positions that are focused on the negative skew of GOLD, whereas I anticipate, contrary to popular belief, that GOLD is now embarking on a new journey, one that consolidates, slows-down, and begins to move in a negatively-skewed fashion. Now keep in mind, this is not some hunch, not some wild thought; rather, validated by my equations, research and so on. A multitude of variables and everything inbetween; this by no means is a guaranteed move, not in the slightest, and this is why I've only allocated a maximum of 5% of my entire portfolio weight to back this move. After all, nothing is ever guaranteed. 

Mind you, I never short, nor do I play options, leverage or else, but purely purchase open-market publicly-available-shares, and in the case for my GOLD moves, are actually ETFs that focus on GOLDs negative-skew. Why? Because with this ETF, I still maintain downside control; theoretically, I determine if I want to be in the maximum -20% and sell, or -50% and sell, rather than a standard short position where my downside could be absolutely uncontrollable. And I always aim to maintain the maximum control possible throughout any investment/trade etc.

**Realized Capital Efficiency (RCE)**

RCE captures what was actually realized, not mark-to-market swings or simulated outcomes. It basically measures how efficiently capital compounded through closed-trades, net of fees, deposits and any withdrawals. To me, it provides the cleanest representation of execution skill over market noise.

2025 year-to-date, I've an RCE of: +22%...and counting

After hitting any +15% YTD RCE to any given year, I automatically switch to a higher defensive mode strategy, as is the case today, not only because of this, but also because the market warrants a significantly higher prudence to being extremely defensive. I do not for one second, believe that the market is a-ok, on the contrary, is increasingly flashing alarm bells, signals and whistles and even if one does not stand on that side, one must not ignore todays market conditions. 

Too many unknowns are at play, and the market hates unknowns, even though it might not showcase it to the naked-eye, but it surely showcases it in other forms. One must search for them, and one must make a determination on what to do with them; both approaches of being invested or not make sense, the real question is, invested in what?

**The Bait-and-Switch**

I'm personally fully invested in the market as of today:

* 75% within highly-defensive equities
* 20% within US treasuries
* 5% within negatively-skewed-GOLD-ETFs

That said, my aim as of now is capital preservation, with every single equity I own generating some sort of dividend, and if a stock-market-hit-actually-occurs, I've not only limited my downside holding such defensive equities, but am still generating income through the use of these dividends. 

We however, how no assurances on whether or not the dividends will cease to exist or be severely impaired due to any potential market-shock, however to me, those odds are extremely slim; not eliminated, yet slim. 

Thus taking an approach where stocks are currently undergoing a bait-and-switch-approach, whereas some stocks on the surface are seemingly superb, while others are seemingly not-so-superb, and now, I'm positioned within multiple of these ""not-so-superb"" stocks, that on the surface don't look appealing, yet once the ""hit"" occurs, they'll be in the  highly favored pile.

My position on this will not change for many months, currently, my timeframe is until Q1/Q2 2026 where I anticipate, according to my hypothesis/equations/etc, that the time for a new shift occurs. Keep in mind, the ""radar"" we all have must be on 24/7, 365 days of the year, as the market is highly organic, and one must parallel themselves to this if one is to make the most benefit; AKA profit, and maximum capital preservation. One must be able to shift their approach and never hold onto it for the sake of worrying about a change of stance/opinion etc. Aint got time for ego.

**Your Equation**

To determine the best approach, you must take your experience into account; all of it, wins, losses, time in market, trades in market, your ""edge"", your ""non-ego"" approach, your ""gut"", your ""learning"", and a million things inbetween.

It's never so pin-pointed to state them, as each of these provides your equation with a different weighted-scale. The more blunt you are to your equation, the more you understand how to distribute the ""weights"" within each variable, the better your equation delivers results.

Theres an infinite amount of inputs and variables, and you simply do not know what you do not know, so keep learning, keep an open mind, throw away any and all ego, and learn. Imitate, innovate and find your path. We all have an edge, some more-so than others, and theres not one person that has a single cell beyond what you already have within. Find it, nourish it and continue the build.

My equations took years to build and continue non-stop; only through immense hardships of destroying my entire portfolio to the tune of -40% from 2020-2022 to a now +10% total portfolio from 2022-2025 did I get to where I am today. There's no ""I made it"" no ""lets party""; its a continuation to the next day, the next month, the next year, onwards and upwards is the name of the game.

Would this be a good long term investment as a european? Should i add or change something a bit or is this good?
"Thoughts on swapping WXUS (or VEA+VWO) for Avantis ETFs? I think I’d prefer to keep DM and EM separated, and the most recommended option in that case is 60% VTI, 30% VEA, and 10% VWO. But I’ve noticed that in international markets, factor investing has really paid off over the last two decades: it’s easy to compare VEA with DFIEX, and VWO (or an MSCI equivalent) with DFCEX.

So would using Avantis funds be a good alternative for the international portfolio? These are three possible strategies with a small value/size tilt internationally and profitability screening:

- 60% VTI, 30% AVDE, 10% AVEM
- 60% VTI, 20% AVDE, 10% AVDV, 10% AVEM (stronger tilt to small value)
- 60% VTI, 40% AVNM (the most hands-off, but with less flexibility and currently low AUM)

Expense ratio with Avantis is a bit higher but combined with VTI it's still quite low (0.12 - 0.14 total).

I know there are some equivalent DFA ETFs, but in their short history it looks like Avantis has had the edge over DFA funds and ETFs."
"Should I sell these from my brokerage and buy VOO? I recently transferred my brokerage account from managed at Edward Jones to self-managed at Fidelity. I have a few hundred dollars in each of these:  

\- BSV

\- IEFA

\- ITOT

\- JHMXX

\- SCZ



They have all been owned for longer than a year? I have the rest of my brokerage in VOO. Anything wrong with selling these and buying VOO with them? I'm mostly just trying to consolidate for simplicity. I have VTI and VXUS in my roth ira and trad ira and VOO in my brokerage. I'm newish to investing so just making sure I'm not missing anything."

"Confused about SGOV ETF decreasing in value I thought I had asked this question before and after reading up, I felt assured at the time that SGOV is virtually the safest option out there other than keeping cash in the bank because it holds the US govt treasury. I had bought some SGOV ETFS on 8/12 and on 8/15 (3 months ago ) but now I notice my Schwab account shows there is a loss of about $18.79 on the first lot and a 1$9.88 gain on the other lot. Meaning, there is grand total of less than a dollar in the past 3 months?  
The cost basis as per Schwab is:  
\- $100.56 for the first lot and current price is $$100.54

\- $100.50 for the second lot and current price is $100.54

Is this expected? What am I missing here?

Edit: I was only looking at the cost basis chart. I got dividends each month which, for the last  3 months, come up to 1.0006% of my principal investment.   
If anyone is familiar with how to indicate this dividend when it comes to file taxes, so that California state tax can be avoided, please comment below. (I used to use Online Tax, OLT and wondering if US treasury dividend requires anything special when filing taxes.)"

Should I just pop into SGOV and watch the market until I feel more comfortable?  Not like, trying to time anything specific, but this AI/Tech stock booms right now just don't feel legitimate to me.

Or would you just dump into SPY/VOO and let it ride?

"Help tonachieve my humble goal Hey everyone,
Looking for feedback on my current portfolio. My goal is long-term growth to retire around 50–55, with monthly contributions (I don't need much, probably 1500 usd per month, I can even do it with 1000 usd). I am 35 and I just started investing. These are my current positions:

My holdings:
AAPL, AISP, CLOV, COST, IBKR, JEPI, JNJ, MAIN, MTRX, NVDA, NVO, QBTS, QCOM, RGTI, SCHD, V, VOO.

I know it is a bit mixed, some solid blue chips, some dividends, and some small speculative plays that I buy and sell with small earnings. I am investing around 2000aud per month. I do not do crypto, I might but I am too scared 

Rough breakdown I am aiming for (ideal %):

Core Growth (40%) → NVDA, AAPL, NVO, V
Index backbone (25%) → VOO, SCHD
Dividend income (15%) → MAIN, JEPI, JNJ
Speculative / high risk (10%) → AISP, QBTS, RGTI, CLOV
Other diversified picks (10%) → COST, IBKR, QCOM, MTRX

Would you adjust any of these percentages?
Is the speculative portion too high or reasonable for long-term?
And is there any stock here that you would stop buying entirely?

Any thoughts appreciated."

"Looking for an online tool/app to quickly model portfolio allocations Looking for an online tool/app to quickly model portfolio allocations

I’m looking for an online tool, app, or website that lets me manually enter my ETF and mutual fund holdings and then adjust the percentage weights of each holding to instantly see how the overall allocation changes (e.g., US vs. international, equity vs. fixed income).

Morningstar’s portfolio tools get close, but I have to change the number of shares instead of simply adjusting percentage weights, which is too inefficient. Ideally, I want something that lets me build or tweak portfolios by sliding percentages up or down and getting real-time allocation feedback.

"PAC Permanent Portfolio Recommendations Good morning, about a year ago I decided to start creating a PAC with a time horizon of 25/30 years. After a year I had some doubts about its composition. I used the model called Permanent Portofolio divided into the following allocations

26% Oblig. USA 20+ years
26% Oblig. USA 0-1 year
22% Gold

"Thoughts on Portfolio with VTI, SCHG, SPMO, AVDE, and AVDV I know this type of question has been asked again and again, but I just want an extra insight on my plan for taxable investment account. Right now I am thinking of doing 55% VTI, 20% SPMO, 10% SCHG, 10% AVDE, and 5% AVDV. My mentality is I have some exposure to both growth and momentum in the US markets and also exposure to international markets with a factor tilt. I am a 22 year old Systems Engineer and am not opposed to taking on some risk right now. 

Also, would there be some benefit to splitting some of these up into a Roth IRA or adding alternatives in one?"
"When you sell part of a stock/ETF, the whole thing depreciates, right? I learned long ago that when you sell part of a stock/ETF, the “oldest” money, that has the highest lever as it’s been in longest, gets taken out first. So for a long-term strategy, how bad is it of an idea to sell parts of stocks that I trust will stop performing as well as I want them to? As the compound interest effect would become weaker.

Context: I invest into stocks for retirement and shuffle them around if I see no potential in one particular stock or ETF anymore. 

EDIT: I always assumed FIFO was the only method. And for most EU countries, it is! By law. There is a workaround with two accounts though. Profit: oldest lots have the highest tax rate, so it makes sense to be able to choose which ones you would like to sell."
"Shift in Momentum? Even with all the recent AI hype, VTI only paced VXUS within the past 6 months. Could the great tariff scare have been the moment when long term momentum shifted from US markets back to international? Obviously, we won't know for another 5-10 years but it's a pretty good case for int'l diversification

Since 2014, all VTI outperformance relative to VXUS can be attributed to changes in relative P/S valuations. P/S can be decomposed into the product of P/E and profit margin. So basically, the US has enjoyed expanding profit margins relative to those of int'l as well as rising sentiment (P/E)

As valuations change, it becomes increasingly harder for the riser (VTI) to outperform the faller (VXUS). At higher valuations, dividend/buyback yields drop. So an equalization in price momentum is bound to happen at some point

Then a momentum shift in favor of int'l outperformance seems like it would then require some kind of mean reversion. Maybe US profit margins contract or those of int'l expand. And then sentiment (P/E) shifts to compound those effects"
"Inheriting UTMA and don't like the holdings 23M - Hey Guys! As mentioned above, I just inherited my UTMA and I am so blessed but my grandpa had some interesting stocks. CARR, OTIS, RTX, WFC, XOM. They are not horrible options but man if he would've chosen AAPL or AMZN haha. (I really am so grateful). My plan is to simplify my portfolio into VTI, VGT, and VXUS.

Just for reference the current portfolio vs SP 500:

1Y: 6.12% vs 14.67%

3Y: 26.30% vs 77.79%

5Y: 119.53% vs 102.25%

10Y:  88.66% vs 291.96%

What do y'all take away from this, am I on the right track? My main question is when I sell and reallocate how would you all go about doing this in such a market where everything is overvalued and expensive. I do believe in time in the market beats timing the market but with $200,000 I am afraid to just throw it all in at once. What should I do??? Thanks in advance!!

"Need more information on investing stocks, mainly ETFs. So I've only recently started investing in ETFs these past few months and have been doing my own sporadic research into what I feel is the right investment for me. I chose to use Fidelity as it just makes it easier for a total newbie like me, and doesn't feel intimidating at all. I'm currently mid-20s and just looking at my financial future, I'm not looking to get rich quickly or make super ridiculous amounts of money, but just want to learn how to invest and use my money wisely is all.

Right now majority of my investment is into SPYM, about 80%, which, as I've read, many tend to prefer VOO. But I chose SPYM just do to its lower expense ratio and being essentially the same as VOO.

I am looking into investing 10% in international stocks and 10% in bond stocks as well, as I'm investing for the long term. I do prefer stocks where I can just set it and forget it, occasionally just keep checking up on it from time to time.

For bond stocks, I saw that there were many options, but I chose BND in the end. But internationally, I'm on the fence about whether to choose VXUS or VT. I know VT basically would overlap, as it also holds the US market in it, as it basically is like 60% VOO, unlike VXUS which excludes the US.

I myself don't mind the overlap, but would like some more guidance, criticism, and overall knowledge regarding this. Also, if anyone can tell me more about what ""market cap"" means in this context, and how bond stocks work in more detail.

  
I know this is just based off my personal goals and own calculated risks, but if I'm doing something objectively wrong or inefficiently, then please yell ""stupid"" or tell me how I could do better if only just by 1%."

"Over 50% International? I'm new to investing and was wondering if it would be a good idea to do over 50% international?

At this moment I'm just not very confident about the domestic market due to the irratic actions of the current administration and think that international will continue the trend of outperforming the US like in the 2000's.

I'm thinking of doing 80% VXUS as my core while keeping 20% VOO for some safety for my first ETFs.

I'm also thinking about just doing 40% AVDV and 40% IDMO instead of VXUS as their performance looked even better.

"70/30 ETF strategy Greetings, kind strangers. I’m a beginner in investing and I’d like a quick check to see if my plan makes sense.

I live in Croatia (Zagreb). Here the tax is 0% if you hold investments for more than 2 years, and 12% on capital gains if held for less than 2 years.
I have around €2,800 saved, my monthly income is around €2,200, and I run a small business as an additional income stream (I reinvest about €100–200/month into the business, mostly equipment, and I’m profitable every month).
I usually manage to save €600–800/month, and I’m in my early twenties.

I plan to invest €100 per month into ETF-s as an alternative to regular savings, while keeping the rest of my monthly savings in my bank account as I do now. I chose accumulating ETF-s for tax simplicity.

70% low-risk:
– VWCE
– IWDA

30% medium-risk:
– CSPX
– EIMI

Monthly allocation:
– €35 → VWCE
– €35 → IWDA
– €15 → CSPX
– €15 → EIMI

I’m using Trading212 with AutoInvest.
Does this strategy make sense, and what would you change? Also, is €100/month a reasonable amount to start with?

Thanks."

 Figured a simple yet less correlated setup could work well here, and benefit from the tax advantages. When my other accounts ""zig"" this can ""zag""

"VEA / VWO not inverse to VOO? Hey all,

Looking to improve the diversification of my portfolio with international exposure, and came across VEA & VWO for developed / emerging markets.

Wanted to get the community's thoughts on:

1) why this is the case?
2) should I be looking at other etfs or approaches in general to offset any US market drops outside of international exposure?

"The Past and Future of QQQ Disclaimer: I don't own any QQQ nor am I asking for any personal advice

The NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is coincidentally also the best proxy for measuring all things related to the AI boom for publicly listed companies. And it's highly debated whether we've entered into an AI bubble.

So let's use QQQ fundamentals to see what's happened and what's possible going forward. The full return decomposition equation is...

Return = (SPS Growth)x(Margin Growth)x(P/E Growth)x(1+Dividend Yield)

Since 2017...

~Sales per share (SPS) have grown at an effective 9% CAGR

~Profit Margins grew from 13.7% to 20.6% contributing 4.6% CAGR

~Valuations (Forward P/E) grew from 17.3 to 28.4 contributing 5.7% CAGR

~Idk avg dividend yield and idc to calculate it, but it's likely around 0.8%

~Putting these all together gives 21.5% total CAGR

~Account for 0.2% expense ratio and we match the exact result from testfolio
https://testfol.io/?s=gdp5PqHmx47

As you can see, lots of tailwinds in the recent past, some of which being only **transient** (non-recurring) like margin and valuation expansion. If profit margins and valuations stop rising, then QQQ will be fully reliant upon its **structural return** alone going forward. This is bound to happen someday, as everyone knows that margins/valuations cannot grow to infinity.

The structural returns of QQQ are those which are recurring, SPS growth and dividend yield. Current dividend yield is at 0.2% so combine that with SPS CAGR to get a projected 9.2% structural return if conditions persist.

So here's a question, can SPS keep growing at 9% annually going forward? Quick research estimates 3% of that growth is from buybacks. So I guess the question is whether QQQ can grow raw revenue at 6% annually? If not, then we've got a problem. For reference, that growth is about 50-80% faster than the US GDP growth rate. And how much of this revenue growth is from recent circular AI deals?

Also what if margins/valuations not only stopped expanding, but began to contract. How likely is it that profit margins can expand even further from here? What will be that catalyst for even greater efficiency from these mega caps?

So with current structural return at 9.2% before inflation, are the smaller potential further margin/valuation expansions worth the greater potential contractions? Personally I'd say no, upside potential ain't worth the downside risk."

I’m hearing some people say VGRO, VBAL, etc. 

Interested to hear everyone’s input"
"The most perfect ETF portfolio. Critique. I have crafted the perfect allocations for a portfolio. Inspired by the tears of the gods. Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle. I believe it can weather a tech/AI crash fairly well, while still being aggressive and USA biased. I'm looking for critique. Or affirmation I found perfection.

Here are the allocations and ETF choices.

    Government bonds      SCHR 10.00%
    Schwab 1000           SHCK 76.95%
    Small cap value       AVUV  4.05%
    exUS-developed        SCHF  6.75%
    exUS-exChina-emerging VEXC  2.25%
    
    

Firstly. It is 90% stocks, 10% bonds. Inspired by (but not exactly matching) Warren Buffett's recommended portfolio for his wife.
    
Secondly. The stock allocation is split 90/10 US/international. This under weights international. This falls in line with Buffet and Bogle's strategy. They believed international could/should be avoided entirely. But I keep some as a diversification for a US tech/AI crash.
    
Thirdly. The US stock allocation is split 95/5 SCHK/AVUV. This underweight's small cap. I view small cap as risky. This falls in line with Warren Buffet's recommended portfolio which excludes small cap. I don't completely eliminate small cap as it is useful as a defense against a tech/AI crash.
    
Fourthly. No investment in China. To avoid seizure of investments. A risk for any emerging market, but in the case of China it's a realized risk, not just a theoretical.
    

ETF breakdown.    

SCHR. Gov bonds only. They are less correlated with stocks performance. Intermediate term as I bet interest rates will fall in the future.
    
SCHK. The core position. The star of the show. USA cap weighted index of the top 1000 companies. Low 0.03 expense ratio. A middle ground between S&P500 (VOO) and total market (VTI) . Intentionally excludes small cap. I think small caps are risky and should have special hot-glove handling.
    
AVUV. small cap value. Intentionally under weighting as I view it as risky. Using an ETF with a bit more active management to screen out the junk.
    
SCHF. ex-US developed countries. I believe the US will perform better over my lifetime even accounting for occasional foreign success. So allocation is smaller than global cap weight. Diversification against a tech/AI crash.

VEXC. ex-China emerging countries. Intentionally avoiding China for emerging markets. China has seized foreign investments. Accounting books are cooked. Rules/laws are more like loose guidelines. Using emerging markets as a further defense for a tech/AI crash. A small gamble on wild growth."

"Every ETF is correlated with VOO with lower returns I was looking for an ETF as a complement for VOO. However, everything I checked was tightly correlated (rise and fall the same time) with VOO, and just returns less. That includes global stock market, other countries, other pool of stocks etc. 

  
One explanation is that since VOO tends to rise over time, everything that will also rise has to be correlated with it. Another explanation is that it's a positive feedback and perhaps there is simply a strong momentum for VOO. 

  
I did find alternatives to have lower correlation, but they have high cost and lower returns (8-9%).

"If the US is declining (?), do you think it still makes sense to DCA into S&P500 based ETFs for the next 2-4 decades? Hello guys, please forgive me if this is not the right post to make in this subreddit.

I'm just beginning to invest into ETFs and I plan to do so for the next 2-4 decades and I am wondering the long term returns and health of the US economy when it is projected that emerging markets and China will dampen the growth of US-based companies and the overall US economy.

Personally, I think the US equity market is excellent and resilient with no real comparison to any other place anywhere else in the world.

I would kindly like to hear some opinions on this matter?"
"ENDW ENDW (Cambria Endowment Style ETF) objective is: “exposure to major global asset classes including equities, fixed income, real assets, and alternatives”. The fund targets a *notional* exposure of **130%–150%** of total assets using ETFs and futures. 28% CAGR ytd.

Any advice would be much appreciated."
"18 year old just getting started, any opinions? Recently I opened a Roth IRA and put around $1,000 that I had saved up into it. All 4 of these etfs are 25% of my portfolio. I’ve had it for a little over a month and it’s up about 3%. I am quite happy with my progress but am open to changing things if need be. Any suggestions or should I just keep it as is?

"ETFs in EU I want to start buying ETFs monthly (500$) on trading 212. I just finished setting it up. After some reading i decided to go for 60% vti 30% vxus 10% spmo/idmo. I just realised im not allowed to buy these in Europe so I need some eu versions. 

Need some suggestion on whats something similar to the pie above. Should i just go 100% VWCE? Would appreciate any advice since im not familiar with any of the EU versions.

Thanks in advance"
Why is the VWCE “better” than the WEBN? The VWCE is commonly referred to as the “Holy Grail”. But what makes it so much better than the WEBN? What am I missing here?
"40 Year Old Looking For Ideal Plan (Please read) Hello all.. A brief backstory. 

I am 40 years old with roughly $40k in a joint taxable account with my father through Schwab. The money has been sheltered here to protect it from ongoing divorce litigation.

I’ve played with high income ETFs over the past 4 months due to being out of work. I’ve managed to live frugal and instead of using the distributions, I’ve reinvested them to build up my shares. Unfortunately, NAV has destabilized and distributions haven’t kept up. Again, the choice was made due to employment situation. Either way, lesson learned. 

I will be resuming employment shortly and am looking for an ideal investment plan given the details I’ve included above. 

At this point I’m interested in the best growth, tax friendly return possible. With a portfolio or single comprehensive fund that will require the least amount of attention possible. 

I understand, I will most certainly be given different ideas from the experienced investors here. But, look towards coming to a consensus and move forward with a plan. 

Thank you to all in advance.."

Been thinking about investing it in VCLT since it’s a pretty safe bond fund with pretty decent returns and a pretty low expense ratio. Also I’ll be able to sell quick if I need the cash.

"28 year old beginner UK Hello everyone,

I know there are lots of posts like this and maybe I am being too much of a perfectionist for someone who doesn't have in depth understanding of investing. I would like to gain some further insight. I see lots of advice of just all in on all word ETF (VWRP). I am willing to do this too but I have a niggling feeling of missing out on emerging markets and small cap.

My goal is to contribute to these for the next 25 years. I have VWRP/AVEG/AVSG. I understand that VWRP is 90% developed markets (large and mid cap). So i included AVEG to cover all cap emerging markets, and AVSG to cover small cap developed markets. I am thinking of a weighting of VWRP/AVEG/AVSG; 60/25/15.

Thanks guys!"

Based on this allocation, would anyone have any recommended changes to my positions? I do want between 20 and 25% in real estate, as well as up to 15% in international. Any significantly better alternatives to the ETFs I currently have in that track the same things?"
"Thoughts on Diversification and Adding Gold Hi everyone,

I am 31 years old, Canadian, and have been investing 100% in VFV within my TFSA for the past 2–3 years. My long-term goal is to remain invested for 25–30 years assuming I am still around by then!

Lately, I have been thinking more seriously about diversification. With so many uncertainties around the world (which I doubt will fade anytime soon), I feel it might be wise to add some exposure outside North America and perhaps include a small allocation to gold as a form of stability during market downturns.

I realize that investing in VFV, which tracks the S&P 500, already gives me indirect exposure to global markets since many of those large US companies operate internationally. However, I know this is not the same as being directly diversified across different regions and currencies (or maybe it is?). While many believe the US will continue to outperform, no one can be certain and adding some diversification could also provide a bit of emotional reassurance.

In short, I am considering an allocation of **80% VFV as the core, 15% VIU for international exposure, and 5% gold**. Alternatively, I might go with an *80/20 VFV–VIU split*. Before I make any changes, I would really appreciate your insights or feedback to see if my reasoning makes sense or needs adjustment.

Thanks so much for your time and guidance!"
"I’ve just started investing in SPYM. Am I on a good path? Looking to hold for 10+ years. Ive seen all the VOO vs other ETF arguments on here. Would just like a few quick responses and I’ll be on my way. 

SPYM is the only ETF I have at the moment. Was thinking about looking into VT at the start of next year. I’m really just looking for something that I can put some of my paycheck in each week and let it grow over the next decade. Any reason I should change my thought process? Or just stick with SPYM and watch it grow?

Note: I have a little bit in NVDA, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and a couple other smaller companies."
"VGK (European Stock Index) Hits New ATH Share Price After 18 Days!! Sorry did I say days? 



I meant years, it took VGK: Vanguard European Stock Index Fund 18.04 years, or 6,587 days to reach a new ATH share price since it peaked with an intraday high of 82.09 per share price back on October 31st, 2007. I just want to take a moment to thank all of the Redditors who only invested in Europe, it is the way of the future.

>! Also, before any of you bozos say ""you need to include dividends, you're being disingenuous"", A. This is purely about share price. B. I did not include dividends for any other funds, since none of them are dividend funds. Even SDY had an ATH on May 23rd, 2007 and recovered on March 28th, 2013. C. If you really want to go there, add inflation and taxation. Which I will do for you, the nominal total return with dividends from October 31st, 2007 to today is around 90%, giving a CAGR of 3.6%. Qualified dividend tax rate brings dividends down 15%, a tax drag of 0.48% annually, reducing the CAGR to 3.12. The cumulative inflation from that time period is around 50% or a annualized rate of 2.2%, bringing it down to a real CAGR of, drum roll please, 0.92%!!! A more liberal measure is a high of 1.3% CAGR. So there ya go, you want your argument, sure it has grown every year 1.3%. Wow, you got me. Europe is totally okay !<"

"Opinion on my factor tilted portfolio Hello, 31m, located in Switzerland (so no tax from capital gains)

I built a portfolio to take advantage of rebalancing (sell high buy low) and multi factor tilts while keeping a lot of diversification across US and International.

QQQM 20% 
SPMO 20% 
AVUV 20% 
IDMO 15% 
AVDV 15% 
AVES 10%

Total expanse ratio : 0.25% (25% for every 10k invested)

This gives us 60% US, 30% Developed, 10% Emerging

Factors : 45% Value and Profitability 35% Momentum 20% Growth

Size : 55% Large Caps 45% Mid-Small

Would this be a portfolio you trust in to invest in the next 25-30 years ? Would quarterly rebalancing or active rebalancing (sell and buy when any holding drift by 5% from my target) be more efficient ? Would you replace any of the ETF I chose ?

I like Avantis funds to filter out all the bad companies from small caps, developed and emerging. SPMO and QQQM could overlap but at this moment they only do so by 20% of their holdings. My goal is to use the negative correlation between Value and Momentum with rebalancing to increase return and only chose etf invested in a small number of companies. I know this resemble a broad market strategy and that it would be simpler but I trust factor tilting. I hesitated between VOO, AVUS, but realised QQQM could give me a lot of diversification instead.

I will DCA 1k every month into this portfolio at least

Give me your honest opinion and thanks for reading this far !"

"Aerospace ETFs: defence play or growth tilt, or both I hold a small position in ITA Aerospace & Defence. Its weighting is heavily concentrated in the big defense names (GE, RTX, Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop). It’s a large-cap industrial ETF with steady manufacturing exposure. We’ll always need flying metal things. +36% this year.

But I’ve been looking at XAR, which has actually outperformed ITA this year (+39%). It’s equal-weighted across mid and small caps like Rocket Lab, Kratos, AeroVironment, Archer Aviation, etc. — more of a growth and innovation angle within the same sector.

My plan was to keep adding to ITA for the stability, but now I’m wondering if I’d get better upside by either splitting between the two or moving fully into XAR.

Curious what others think; is ITA still the smarter long-term hold for defense exposure, or does XAR make more sense going forward?"

I have my emergency funds that have always been in a regular savings account and kept it very low, a few months expenses. I sold my house and profited around 50k after closing and would like to put it all in SGOV or a similar fund for a couple years (we are expecting a second child and just having moved and changed jobs, I want to stay more principal protected than the S&P can provide). I don’t struggle with anxiety or temptation to buy nonsense with it when I don’t need to be. I’m young this money is in the stock market (or going to eventually) where it belongs."
"Good rule of thumb for an optimal 3 fund portfolio. As a newbie (31M), I was ready to start my 3 fund portfolio this month with VOO, VT, QQQM (40/40/20) on a DCA basis each month. But I've been seeing stuff on ""fund overlap"" and ""diversification"" and it's thrown a wrench into my ""strategy"". I'm smart enough to know I know absolutely nothing. However, the VXUS arguments don't move me as I feel when America suffers, the world usually suffers with it. Did a 10 year analysis and for every period VOO ""plummeted"", VXUS plummeted just as much or more. So why not go all in on Big, Bad America? Is there an index that is notorious for doing well when the S&P 500 suffers? What's a good rule of thumb when planning a 3 fund index? Apologies to the purists who hate to see us ""what etf should I buy"" guys coming but I would need your help the most as you are usually brutal but honest. I live in Africa by the way so terms like ROTH, 401K, and IRA will only confuse me further. Keep it simple for me. Thanks everyone."
"Growth Scenario! (For fun & advice) **Torn Between 3 Long-Term Roth IRA Portfolios — Which Would You Choose for Growth and Sanity?**

**Option 1: 80% VTI + 20% VXUS**  
Simple two-fund global portfolio — total U.S. market with a bit of international. Feels balanced and easy to automate, but some say international exposure has been a drag recently.

**Option 2: 80% VTI + 20% VUG**  
Same U.S. core, but with a growth tilt.

**Option 3: 60% VTI + 25% VUG + 15% VXUS**  
Kind of a hybrid between the two: global exposure and a solid growth push. 

  
**For the span of 30+ years**

  
**Background:** Let's say you are in your early 20s!

Which of these setups would you pick, and why?

"Help me allocate in my ETF portfolio. I am trying to create an ETF portfolio to invest for next 30 years. Hoping to invest in following. 

- VTI (choosing this instead of VOO, trying to keep it balanced with large, mid and low caps and hoping this will be my largest allocation)

- VUG (trying to allocate on growth ETF accepting volatility and although it overlaps with VTI, but has better return)

- VUX (international exposure)

- SCHD (keeping minimal amount to get dividend ball rolling)

Can you suggest me what would be ideal percentage allocation for each of these. Let me know if you suggest add/replace-ing with other ETF or if you have other good strategies."

"New to investing. Just have a quick question. Hey everyone. 

I have a quick and, most likely, idiotic question. 

Is it worth just automatically investing like $3.00 a day into an etf like VOO.

If it’s not a pointless idea, then I would be able to increase the daily investment a bit, but that isn’t going to happen for some time. 

I only ask because I have an annuity at work. They put in $3.25 an hour but I don’t add anything extra to it because I don’t think I make enough to do so. 

I figured I would just add a few dollars daily into an etf and hopefully get a decent return after years have passed. 

If this is all making you less intelligent to read, I apologize."

"What to buy for short term? *Using LLM to organize post, I'm not a bot.*

# Background

* Egyptian, non-US resident with IBKR account
* Currently invested in VOO
* Had $15k liquid since June for potential masters program in Europe (needed as proof of funds for visa)
* Lost opportunity cost by keeping cash instead of investing + inflation

# Main Problems

1. **Short-term capital gains taxes** \- worried about tax implications if I buy/sell within a year as non-US resident
2. **Inflation protection** \- considering bonds but unsure how IBKR handles tax implications for me and volatility

# The Pattern I Keep Repeating

Holding cash for ""might need it"" situations (visa applications, potential expenses) and missing market gains. Happened multiple times now in 2022, 2024, and 2025.

*(Side note: The currency crash story - EGP went from 15.5 to 47.3 per USD, lost a ton on 10k sitting in local currency - is just an example of this pattern. Not an issue anymore since most money in USD now)*

# Questions

1. **Long-term**: Might stick with VOO or similar ETF (eventually switch to Irish-domiciled version)
2. **Short-term/Emergency fund**: What should I hold for money I might need to liquidate within a year? Need something accessible without tax complications
3. **S&P500 concentration risk**: Concerned about tech-heavy weighting, especially NVIDIA at 8%. MSFT, GOOG, META seem safer, but NVIDIA feels overvalued due to AI hype
4. **Ethics concern**: Really hate having defense contractors in my money, but according to LLM they make less than 2%. SPUS or other Shariah-compliant ones are even heavier on tech.

**TL;DR**: How do I balance keeping accessible funds for life events while not losing to inflation/opportunity cost? What's tax-efficient for non-US resident on IBKR for short-term holdings?"

"Telecom industry is about to re-shape; Time to Ditch AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and go long on SpaceX with XOVR ETF EchoStar just sold another $2.6B spectrum to SpaceX for $2.6B, bringing its total spectrum holdings to nearly $20B. This enables Starlink to offer direct-to-cell connectivity, removing regulatory overhang and positioning it to become a leading mobile network operator competing with Verizon, AT&T, etc. (can even expand globally). It can re-shape the entire industry with global scale, high-speed internet, and most importantly, no coverage gap. Starlink's satellite broadband is also seeing massive growth and now already has over 8 million customers across 150 different countries (up from 6 million in June). ARK Invest thinks Starlink could push SpaceX to a $2.5T valuation by decade-end 5x upside). A Starlink IPO could be possible even before SpaceX IPO.   
  
**How to get exposure in SpaceX**   
As a retail investor, my personal favorite is XOVR Private-Public Crossover ETF. SpaceX makes up over 8% of its AUM. It's not just SpaceX, even other holdings like Nvidia, Applovin, etc. are doing really well as XOVR criteria is to invest in disruptive, entrepreneurial companies. XOVR had recently also became the first ETF to provide exposure at the IPO stage (with Klarna IPO, plus it offers liquidity and has very low expense ratio 0.75% compared to other vehicles available for retail investors."
"No Access to Tax Advantaged Accounts I started to get into investing about a month ago (and has opened a taxable account). Later on, I learned that people in the U.S have access to tax advantaged accounts where their investments’ growth are tax free. Recently, I went and check if my home country has anything similar so I can make use of it instead but to my disappointment, we don’t (despite having a flat 20% tax on all capital gains law). To tell you the truth, this destroys a lot of my motivation because now I know that a chunk of my investments will have to go away due to tax. Is there anyone else in this situation or have any words of advice for me?"
"ETF portfolio with utility for the next 40 years I am 20 years old and was in the crypto scene when I was 16. Since then I have left that and started to look at stocks and ETF's. I was doing research and looking for things which have solid usecases and provide a real world utility for the coming decades. I have tried to diversify my portfolio to cover all of these aspects, while still keeping moderate growth and an acceptable risk level. I plan on dollar cost averaging in with a lump sum investment at the start. These are the projects that I have found and believe have potential for the next 40+ years (until my retirement), although my focus was mainly on the utility, rather than the stock/ETF itself. I'm just wondering to see what your thoughts on this portfolio are, and if you have any suggestions. I obviously know not to invest on the word of a stranger and would never, but I am open to hearing your thoughts and any other stocks/ETF's you believe in that I could do my own research on.

"Seeking Advice on My 2025 Roth IRA Investment Strategy (Late 40s, Aggressive Growth Approach) Hey everyone,  
Hope you’re all doing well! I wanted to get your thoughts and feedback on my Roth IRA investment strategy.

I’ve just finished maxing out both mine and my wife’s Roth IRA contributions for 2025 (totaling **$7,000 each**). Below is how I’m planning to allocate the funds in each account:

|ETF|Target $|Actual $|% Allocation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$SCHX|$2,800|$2,800|40%|
|$SCHF|$1,400|$1,400|20%|
|$AVUV|$1,750|$1,750|25%|
|$SCHG|$1,050|$1,050|15%|
|**Total**|**$7,000**|**$7,000**|**100%**|

  
m in my **late 40s** and want to keep a **somewhat aggressive growth profile** for the next 4–5 years (a bit of a late start, I know). After that, I plan to **rebalance annually**, likely moving some allocation toward bonds or more conservative assets.

Would appreciate your insights on:

* Whether this allocation seems reasonable for an aggressive growth approach
* Any changes or alternative ETFs you’d recommend
* Anything else I should consider given my age and time horizon

Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts!"

"I need your suggestion this question cracking my head Hello Dear people. I am 23M and I am relatively new investor (3rd month). And as you can see  my goal is to invest some amount each month to the Pie.

Honestly I have no valuable knowledge that's why I m here and open to your suggestions. I am believing that ""two heads are better than one"" :).

I know this is heavily on technology sectors but I tried to choose global etf with relatively less TER.

What do u think about this pie? Is it worth to stick with it for a long time or do you think there is too much overlap.

I am really thinking this thematic etf can go higher and higher in upcoming decades but I am aware that this is going on heavily Us tech sector.

P.S: there is also 10% Bitcoin ETF whic did not fit to the photo. 

Thank you for your time for sharing your thoughts with me. I wish you all a beautiful day."

"How can I open a brokerage account from a Balkan / third-tier country to invest in EU and US stocks? Hi everyone,

I’m from the Balkans — a third-tier country where most big brokers don’t seem to operate (specifically Kosovo). I’ve been trying to find a legal, beginner-friendly way to start investing in EU and US stocks, mainly index funds like the S&P 500 (VOO, CSPX, VUSA) or even some individual stocks like Tesla or Nvidia.

The problem is that the well-known platforms — Fidelity, Vanguard, Robinhood, Schwab, eToro, Trading 212 — all either block my country or require EU/US residency.

So my question is:
	•	Which brokers actually accept residents from smaller Balkan countries like Kosovo, Albania, or North Macedonia?
	•	Has anyone here successfully opened an account from this region?
	•	Are there any low-fee, beginner-friendly options that let you start with around €50–100 per month?
	•	And if not, are there any practical workarounds (legally, not VPN or fake address stuff) to access ETFs like VOO or UCITS equivalents?

I’m mainly looking for real experiences or step-by-step advice from people outside the EU/US who managed to start investing legitimately.

Thanks in advance — I’d really appreciate any guidance or firsthand stories."

"Study on Leveraged SP500 https://preview.redd.it/4zhgydvl220g1.png?width=1921&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a7b68a9fc38f39e7733e1cf9280174c0f9d5a9

# Motivation

I am very interested in studies about leveraged ETFs and how they can be a tool to achieve higher returns through greater market exposure. However, nothing is free, and the same tool that can double your capital can also take it to zero.

There are some studies on the use of leverage for the long term, one of them being [Leverage for the Long Run - A Systematic Approach to Managing Risk and Magnifying Returns in Stocks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701). The most interesting point of this article (in my opinion) is presenting a ""rotation"" strategy between being leveraged or not, depending on market conditions. However, for this study, it will be assumed that leverage was maintained throughout the entire period.

The SP500 is one of the most widely used index as a market average. Many funds and stock picking investors fail to outperform it. Given the belief that *""The SP500 always goes up""*, there is much discussion about *""why not increase gains with leveraged SP500?""*.

This study analyzes precisely the impact of holding leveraged positions in this index for medium/long periods. A small example is: *""Are 10 years enough to be sure that the SP500 2x will outperform the SP500?""*

* [From 2000 to 2010, the cumulative return of the SP500 2x was -59.79% vs. 6.10% for the SP500;](https://testfol.io/?s=1W9jkTF1v7b)
* [From 2010 to 2020, the cumulative return of the SP500 2x was 870% vs. 314% for the SP500;](https://testfol.io/?s=jac6MqaZQUg)

Two consecutive decades. Completely different results.

# Preparation

Using the testfol.io API, I compared 5 portfolios from 1970 to 2025:

* SP500
* SP500 1.5x Leveraged
* SP500 2x Leveraged
* SP500 2.5x Leveraged
* SP500 3x Leveraged

Since none of the leveraged ETFs existed since the beginning of the period, the simulation was performed using `SPYSIM` which has data since 1885. I also took into account the expense ratio of each portfolio.

|Portfolio|Alias|Expense Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|100% SPYM|SP500|0.02%|
|100% SPUU|SP500 2x|0.60%|
|100% SPXL|SP500 3x|0.87%|
|50% SPYM + 50% SPUU|SP500 1.5x|0.31%|
|50% SPUU + 50% SPXL|SP500 3x|0.735%|

Observations:

* The VOO ETF is more popular than SPYM (formerly SPLG), but the expense ratio is higher (0.03%);
* The SSO ETF is more popular than SPUU, but the expense ratio is higher (0.89%);
* The UPRO ETF is more popular than SPXL, but the expense ratio is higher (0.89%);
* It would be possible to obtain lower expense ratios for 1.5x, 2x and 2.5x by combining SPYM with SPXL, however I only realized this after already obtaining the data. Although the difference exists and is not necessarily insignificant (especially in the larger rolling windows), the final results/conclusions would not be so different.

The following rolling windows (in years) were tested: 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5.

# Algorithm

Let's take the 30-year rolling window as an example. 26 backtests were performed (2025 - 1970 - 30 + 1).

* Backtest 1: 1970 to 2000
* Backtest 2: 1971 to 2001
* Backtest 3: 1972 to 2002
* ...
* Backtest 26: 1995 to 2025

For each backtest, for each portfolio, the results shown in the testfol.io main table (cumulative return, CAGR, maximum drawdown, etc.) were saved.

At the end of executing all possible backtests for the rolling window, an HTML file was generated containing the graph of each of the obtained results. In addition, tables were also generated containing the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values of each of these attributes.

Example:

I am still studying the results to extract all the information I need to decide on the use of leverage. I also reinforce what was mentioned at the beginning of the post, about the rotation strategy, which seems to be very interesting to reduce the negative impact that volatility brings to this type of investment."
"Trying to learn how long-term investors stay calm during market swings I’ve been reading a lot about index investing and patience lately.
The idea of “staying the course” sounds simple, but in practice, it’s tough when the market drops or stalls.

For those who’ve been investing for years — how do you actually manage to stay calm and not make emotional decisions during rough markets?"

Advice on etfs Im 18 and looking into etfs and was wondering if 65%VOO 15%SMH and 15% VXUS with 5% for shit like Femasys and other companies that ive been making money off is a good lineup for some long term investing? Ive seen it mentioned that I need to keep a eye on SMH and it's not as much of a buy and forget about it like voo is. Just wanted some more opinions before I started putting money into everything.

"Middle aged Canadian investing in ETFs I'm finally getting focused on my longer term plan (age 60+) and I enjoy the promise of ETFs.

Right now my portfolio is:

VFV: 55%

XEQT: 35%

IBIT: 10%

All in my TFSA

What are some other ETF's I should pursue as a Canadian investor that would also expose me to foreign markets, precious metals (Gold prefereably), equity and crypto. Is IBIT the right one as a Canadian for bitcoin?

Some of the other ETFs I've been following are QQQ, IAU, VEQT.

"ETF/Fund mix check — good long-term combo or too much overlap? Hey everyone,
Looking for some feedback on my current Fidelity setup. I’m investing for the long term (20+ years) and contributing $100 every two weeks.

Here’s the current breakdown of my portfolio:
     FXAIX – Fidelity 500 Index Fund (31.9%)
     QQQM – Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (19.8%)
     FSMAX – Fidelity Extended Market Index (11.8%)
     FZILX – Fidelity ZERO International Index (15.9%)
     GDLC – Grayscale Digital Large Cap Trust (8.4%)
  SPAXX – Fidelity Government Money Market (12.1%)

Goal is to keep most of my exposure in large caps (FXAIX + QQQM), add some mid/small caps (FSMAX), a bit of international (FZILX), and a small crypto slice through GDLC. SPAXX is just cash waiting to be deployed. More than likely as time goes on I do plan on increasing my input. 

Does this seem like a solid long-term mix, or should I simplify and go more total-market focused? Curious how others would approach this setup"

My question here is what do you think about VOO and whether if I should add along with VXUS or something else or not? And what do you think about this strategy in general? Also why do some people prefer VT or VTI over VOO?"

"Seems like the portfolio is too safe but heard it's risky as well I’m fairly new to investing, started about 6 months ago. I’m 30, with a low-to-medium risk appetite, and looking to invest with a 15–20 year horizon in mind. After that, I plan to shift to a lower-risk profile as I approach my target retirement age.

For context, I’m not based in US. I’ve invested around USD 10k so far, and plan to contribute about USD 1k monthly. My current portfolio allocation is:

VOO: 30%

QQQM: 20%

VXUS: 20%

SCHD: 10%

DBS/D05: 10%

BND: 5%

GLDM: 5%

I’m wondering if this setup is too safe as I don't have any high volatility or small cap stock? It's mostly large cap ETF and some dividend stocks. I have also received feedback that my portfolio is too risky as my 5% bond allocation and 5% gold will not save me if the AI bubble bursts. I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement. I'm happy to share more details behind my choices if you’re curious!"
"Why ETFs over index funds? A friend of mine told me index funds are like ETFs but better and that he can switch from index fund to another without having to pay taxes because a sale isn't needed. Whereas with ETFs if you wanna put money somewhere else you have to sell.

He suggested me to use index funds.

If this is the case, then why is most people investing in ETFs instead?"
"Should I add VGT or VUG Right now I have 50% VOO, 30%QQQM, and 20% VXUS. Want to know if it’s a good idea/ if there’s any point in either switching from QQQM to VUG(bc VUG has a lower expense ratio) or if it’s an idea to add VGT for more tech exposure. I’m 18 so I feel like I can be more risky although I’m also new to all this."
"30% VOO, VT, VTI and the remaining 10% in 2x/3x leveraged ETF or LEAPS options? The 30% will be in each of the aforementioned index to diversify, hedge and protect from the downside, and the 10% to capture more upside in the short and medium term, worst case scenario for the 10% in leveraged ETFs 2x or 3x or LEAPS options in Mag 7 companies is to lose it all and needing 11% gains to breakeven."
"Am I the only one not voting for the Invesco QQQ change just because they call me multiple times per day and never actually leave a message? It's getting totally ridiculous. My wife and I have been getting calls for months now from random numbers that may or may not be related.  Every call I receive starts with ""Hi, is this \[wife's name\]"" and when I answer ""no"" they just hangup.  The same thing happens how with all the numbers that identify as Invesco QQQ or Sodali.

They rarely leave a message, and bizarrely, when they do, it appears to be a narration of an audiobook.  I kid you not.  I've received two messages of 2.5 minutes (my VM limit) from a number with Invesco QQQ caller ID and the message is a female voice reading what sounds like a novel.

It wasn't until a month ago that I got a letter in the mail that actually explained about the upcoming vote.  If I'd just received that to start, I would have simply voted for the measure, but the ridiculous and strange calls are making me think it's too good to be true and someone is just doing this to get paid."

"Exposure in US Markets Hi everyone,

I’m 26, based in India, working as a software engineer remotely and already have exposure to Indian equities, mutual funds, crypto.
Looking to diversify into US markets for long term - something high risk, high return, with consistent monthly DCA/SIP (~$800/month).

Did a fair bit of reading here and elsewhere, and wanted to keep it simple (2–3 ETFs max) with minimal overlap and no sector/thematic bets - or should I have keeping in mind in investing for long term?

Current shortlist: SCHG,SCHM,VBK

(Also considered QQQ, but not sure if it adds too much overlap)
Goal is long-term compounding, not dividends, and I’m okay with volatility.

Would love to hear thoughts on:
Whether these three complement each other well.
If QQQ is worth including or redundant given SCHG.
Any better alternatives?

Appreciate any help!"

Pretty new to this community and seeking out some commentary for my first ETF investment.

"Advice 21M I am holding SPY and QQQ in my taxable.

With my current positions in SPY and QQQ, would it be worth it for me to-

1. Sell what I have and pay the capital gains and then go VOO and QQQM (averse to this option)

2. Stop contributing to these two and from now on just contribute to QQQM and VOO

3. Simply continue contributing to SPY and QQQ

I realize now for long term holding (exactly what I plan on doing), the expense ratio for VOO and QQQM would be in my favor. I never plan on doing options. Just want general advice."
"Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong Hi everyone,

"How to compare/evaluate similar ETFs? I'm looking at index ETFs and a couple of derivative income ETFs based on that same index. 



A: Index Fund ETF (IWM) = 14.3% NAV Return with 1% Distribution Yield.

B: Derivative ETF (ITWO) = 12.4% NAV Return with 13.9% Distribution Yield.

C: Derivative ETF (IWMI) = 12.9% NAV Return with 14.4% Distribution Yield.

  
How do I compare the three? Based solely on return/yield, which one is the best? Similarly, there's \[QQQ, IQQQ, QQQI\] and \[SPY, ISPY, SPYI\]."
"It’s less what ETF you are picking and more that you are consistently investing. 2 out of every 3 posts in the sub are asking VOO, VTI or VT. Do I need international exposure? Do I need bond exposure? ETC…

Whether you choose VTI or VOO is far less important than just making sure you are consistently investing money. If VOO is going up over time, so is VTI, and so is VT. 

Just be consistent instead of constantly worrying about which one you are picking. Invest every month, year after year. Will everyone’s return percentage be exactly the same? No. But will it be close enough where you didn’t really care because you ended up doing really well for yourself because you consistently put away money? Absolutely."

"For those only invested in VOO. Above is a picture of the Japanese Nikkei 225, as you can see it took 34 years to recover from its peak in 1980s. Notably, in the 70s and 80s you had to convince people not to invest in Japan because it was doing so incredibly well. Now, the United States does not face the same issues as Japan, and the S&P 500 has performed incredibly over the last decade, though nevertheless it is not free from this fate. For this reason, the evidence overwhelming points towards international diversification. Now this may lead to worse performance or it may not. Regardless it is certainly a good idea. Each time I read this subreddit and see people with 100% of retirement funds in VOO or the like I am filled with anxiety."

I buy in on different days so the price fluctuates   I acquire 100 shares 

What if I have some money sitting on the sidelines now and the price is lower

My end goal is still 100 shares but want to lower my cost basis.  

I buy 30 more shares at the lower price 
Then wait for the price to get back to where I bought in higher and sell 30 shares of the higher cost basis etf

Planning on holding it long term and not be taxed on a gain so that’s why I would sell the higher price shares when I could sell them for the same price I bought them.

I live in Canada and I started investing a few days ago. My goal is to invest for exactly 18 years.

I’ve been watching videos and reading articles online to figure out what ETF I should buy for my RRSP. I make 130000-138000 CAD each year and can invest 3000 CAD a month. My plan was to invest 750 CAD in SMH and QQQM, and 750 CAD in VOO until I reach the limit and then into RRSP, and 750 CAD into RRSP. I plan to withdraw from TFSA at the end of each year to make at least 18000 CAD worth of contribution room so that I can contribute 1500 CAD each month into TFSA. The 3K plan will start in March next year because I’m planning to invest in RRSP until March. According to my calculations, my tax returns will grow each year if I invest my tax returns in RRSP.

"Etf plan Hi there,

I recently started investing in Etfs. I did extensive research about investment in general and also in Etfs. Eventually I chose to invest in:

Ishares MSCI world SRI Ucits etf EUR acc (Hedged) and Ishares MSCI EM IMI ESG Screened Ucits etf USD acc (non Hedged). My plan is to invest 10+ years and invest monthly 1k into the etfs, splitting my money 70/30 between the etfs. The logic behind this is that the world etf usually is more stable and less volatile and provides stability. The emerging market etf is more volatile, but covers regions and markets which the world etf doesn't cover, thus providing more diversification and the possibility to benefit from the emerging markets if they do well. If the em etf doesn't do well, I still have 70 percent of my money in a stable etf to provide some security. I have like 80k which I can invest, but since am quit new to investing I try to start up slowly and invest more when I feel more confident about it.

How do u rate my investment strategy? Did I miss something important?

Thanks in advance for any feedback!"

"Is there any compelling reason to choose DFSV over AVUV? Looking at the factor regressions for these two US small cap value ETFs, AVUV has slightly more favourable factor loadings for small cap, value, profitability, and low investment. On top of this, AVUV also has a lower MER compared to DFSV (0.25% vs 0.30%). Taken together, is there any good reason to choose DFSV over AVUV? 

Avantis and Dimensional both have a shared history in terms of investing philosophy and strategies, stemming from Avantis being founded by former DFA members. I recognize that these two ETFs will likely perform very similarly in the long run due to similar strategies and methodologies. When looking at the factor regressions and MER however, it just seems logical to go with AVUV. Is there any good reason to opt for DFSV over AVUV?"
"Re-balancing suggestions? Hi all, I (26 yo, M) started investing in index fund around 1.5 year ago, and going to do some re-balancing with the following portfolio:

AVUV: 15%, US Small Cap Value

"Starting Portfolio Good morning everyone. I talked to an advisor today about starting an ETF investment plan, and he suggested 3 possible portfolios for a €500/month DCA plan.

My situation:
	•	Age: 23
	•	Current savings: ~€10,000
	•	Income: €1,500/month (likely to increase in the future)
	•	Investment horizon: very long (20/25+ years)
	•	No major purchases planned
	•	Low monthly expenses (food + some leisure)
	•	I already have 2–3 years of savings set aside for security

Goal: grow my wealth / potentially retire early

I’m not very up to date at the moment. The only thing I requested was to lean a bit more towards the tech sector. I also mentioned that in my view, the two main approaches are:
	•	a single All-World ETF, or
	•	a 3-ETF strategy (e.g., US / ex-US / Emerging Markets).

I’d like to hear some opinions on the 3 portfolios he proposed.
If more info is needed, feel free to ask"
"8k to invest, now or not? Hello everyone, I already invested 2k (I had 10k initially). Everyone is saying blablabla there will be a crash but we don’t really know, markets are at an all time high but I have a long term vision (30-35years). I’m currently DCA every month 1k, should I continue? What’s your opinion on this? 

Thanks a lot!"

"If I want my money after 3 years, should i still invest in VWRA + CSPX? I am from Lebanon. I want to buy a house after 5 years or so. Bank wire transfer fees are 40$ per transfer.

So first question, how much money should I transfer to my IBKR to DCA if I save 800$ each month? I was thinking to save 3000$ and send those per each bank wire transfer due to the high transfer fees. This means I will transfer after each 4 months.

Second, since I need the money after 4 to 5 years, is it wise to invest 50% in CSPX and 50% in VWRA ? I know there's huge overlapp but I need a bit of risks for growth."
"Tell me why I'm wrong Obviously there's a lot that goes into whether or not a given stock/ETF/whatever is a good investment. However, for dividend-paying ETFs, or maybe dividend-paying... whatever in general, I had a thought: what if I divided current share price by most recent distribution amount? 

Say there were 4 ETFs:
* Share price: $1, distribution amount: $0.10
* Share price: $1, distribution amount: $0.01
* Share price: $10, distribution amount: $0.10
* Share price: $10, distribution amount: $0.01

Using my hypothetical metric: 
* You're paying $10 per $1 of distribution
* You're paying $100 per $1 of distribution
* You're paying $100 per $1 of distribution
* You're paying $1000 per $1 of distribution

But it can't be that simple, can it? Is this a valid metric to evaluate ETFs?"
"Long Term Options My platform (Lightyear) recently added automated investment plans earlier this week, and I’ve begun to evaluate my portfolio further as a result.

Currently, I have:
- €MEUD @ 49.59%, up by 5.29% since purchase
- €VUAA @ 40.92%, up by 8.84%
- €EUDF @ 1.80%, up by 10.71%

Most of these were bought earlier this year. Right now, I am considering this:
- €MEUD @ 40%
- €VUAA @ 45%
- €EMIM @ 15%

The rest of the % is some small investments in individual stocks, like NVIDIA - nothing major in terms of amounts - just a few hundred EUR at best.

This is so I have a diversified portfolio for STOXX, S&P and Emerging Markets. However as I am not an expert, I am not sure if I should add more or change anything. I am in it for the long haul (10-15+ years).

I am mostly focusing on accumulating ETFs instead of distributing, as I’d rather have more growth overall (ideally 10% per year, if all goes well). I had ~9-10% profit this year thus far (at least until some dips on Monday).

This begs the question:
- Any other ETFs I should add to the mix (and at what percentage)?
- Should I move or add a few distributing ETFs?

Any guidance would be appreciated."
What happened today? Of course the day after my DCA all my 4 ETFs are down. It's a fraction of a percent. But I am curious about what happened.

"VWRA Vs. SWDA Hey guys, on October 27th 2025, at the age of 31, I started my index investing journey.

I bought VWRA because I couldn't make up my mind about the best long term (30 years) index to be invested in. I only invested 1/4th of my yearly allocation, deciding to break down my first year's investing in four quarters.

Now, I'm wondering,  
Q1 - Should I stick to VWRA? or on Jan 27th 2026 I should consider SWDA?

Because (and correct me if I'm wrong) developed markets have provided better returns over the last 30 years than the total world.

So,  
Q2 - If you do recommend SWDA, should I hold on to the VWRA I've bought?  
or should I sell the shares and put the money into SWDA, so I don't pay two expense ratios?

Would love the community's thoughts on this."

Hey everyone! Earlier this year I rebalanced my dividend portfolio from \~76 Stocks/ETFs down to 27, and now I've decided to narrow it down to only the ETFs that I had in there, which are these 7. I started this account about 5 years ago and didn't realize that I had such repetitive ETFs lol. So my thought now is that I will keep/add the following:

* VTI: 30%
* VYM: 20%

"Seeking new thematic Hey everyone,
I’m currently restructuring the “thematic” part of my long-term ETF portfolio, and I’d love to hear some nuanced opinions from those who really follow sector trends.

Right now my core portfolio is simple:
	•	SXR8 (S&P 500 UCITS)
	•	IWDA (MSCI World UCITS)
These two already give me global exposure and broad diversification.

I’m considering adding one single thematic ETF (not multiple due to commission reasons) — something with real long-term potential, preferably EUR-denominated and UCITS-compliant.

I’ve narrowed it down to three options:


2B7F – iShares Automation & Robotics UCITS ETF (IE00BYZK4552)
	•	Theme: Robotics, industrial automation, AI infrastructure
	•	Structure: Distributing (unfortunately, no ACC version in EUR)
	•	TER: 0.40%
	•	Managed by BlackRock (iShares)
	•	Exposure: ~50% US, ~25% Japan, ~20% Europe
	•	Key holdings: NVIDIA, ABB, ASML, Keyence, Fanuc, Rockwell, Siemens
	•	Traded on Xetra (EUR)

Pros: Highly diversified global robotics exposure, balanced between tech and industry, moderate volatility.
Cons: No accumulating share class in EUR, so small dividends get distributed; momentum can be slower compared to pure AI funds.


RBOT – L&G ROBO Global Robotics & Automation UCITS ETF
	•	Theme: Similar to 2B7F but more growth-oriented
	•	Structure: Accumulating
	•	TER: 0.80%
	•	Issue: Seems to be only listed on BME (Spain) or LSE USD; not available on IBKR for Italian residents.
	•	Pros: More aggressive exposure, higher weight in fast-growing mid-caps.
	•	Cons: Expensive and lower liquidity.


XDWT – Xtrackers MSCI World Information Technology UCITS ETF
	•	Theme: Global technology sector (includes AI & semiconductors indirectly)
	•	Structure: Accumulating
	•	TER: 0.25%
	•	Exposure: ~85% US
	•	Pros: Super cheap, very liquid, clean long-term tech exposure.
	•	Cons: Feels too close to SXR8/IWDA – mainly repeats Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, etc.


What I’m trying to figure out
I’m not looking for short-term hype, but I do want to position myself within a true structural megatrend.
Here’s where my mind is currently spinning
-AI & Robotics (2B7F / RBOT) — this seems like the next industrial revolution, but is the growth already priced in?
-Cybersecurity (ISPY/NATO) — since AI + automation expansion will require data protection, does the “AI boom” automatically imply that cybersecurity will be the next high-growth sector?
-Tech ETFs (XDWT) — cheap and stable, but maybe too mature?
-Is there a better UCITS alternative for “AI + Robotics” with an accumulating EUR version that I’ve missed?

What I’d really like to understand from experts here
-How do you see the long-term growth differentials between robotics (automation hardware) and software-based AI plays?
-Would it make sense to pick cybersecurity (NATO/ISPY) over robotics as a “parallel trend”?
Is the lack of an ACC version in 2B7F actually a meaningful drawback for long-term compounding, or just a minor inconvenience?
-Any known tracking differences or hidden costs (TER vs real tracking) in these ETFs?
For those who’ve held 2B7F or RBOT for 3+ years — how has volatility and liquidity behaved in practice?
-Are there any new UCITS AI ETFs coming to market (HANetf, WisdomTree, etc.) that might be a better long-term bet?


I’m not trying to time anything — just want to choose one “future theme” to hold for at least 5–10 years next to my core IWDA + SXR8 position.
Any deep, data-backed insights would be super appreciated


IWDA + SXR8 are my base.
Now choosing one long-term thematic ETF (EUR, UCITS)
2B7F → balanced AI + robotics infrastructure
RBOT → more aggressive robotics play
XDWT → cheaper global tech exposure

Which one makes most sense for a 5–10 year hold, and what am I missing?

i.e. get a 20k loan for 60 months but I do 1k payments for payoff in 20 months to save 40 months of interests, while I allow the stock to grow after the 20k purchase, rather than doing 1k purchases for 20 months at different stock prices per share.. once loan is paid off, repeat once or twice more.

"Portfolio Feedback Hi folks! 

I got excellent advice last time I was here, so here I am again! 

Late to the party because I've spent years figuring out US taxation as a dual citizen (spoiler alert, it sucks), but here I am. 

I'm looking to create two portfolios: one retirement (30-35 years) and one medium term (think ""buy a home"" but without a real time horizon - maybe 3-5 years?).

For retirement, I'm thinking:
- 60% VTI
- 20% VXUS
- 10% VOO
- 10% QQQM
I'm ignoring BND for now, since the timeline is so long. I do realize that QQQM is functionally a subset of VOO, which is functionally a subset of VTI, which I think is fine over-weighting, but would love thoughts. 

For the more short term I'm less certain - it's short enough that one might argue a HYSA in case of market swings, but since my timeline isn't set in stone, I'm kind of inclined to throw it all in VTI and leave it alone (if the market is down significantly, I'm probably not buying a home regardless?)."

"Looking for clarification on how SGOV specifically works I understand how they work. The price of the ETFs rises as the T-bills mature and then the price drops down after the dividend is paid out, creating the saw tooth chart. What I am having trouble understanding is when the dividend is paid and when I should be putting my money into SGOV, if it even matters. So it says the ex-dividend date was November 3rd. Does that mean that’s when you had to have shares of SGOV by to receive the dividend for the month of October or for the month of November? If I bought SGOV today, would I receive the next dividend payment or would I miss one because the ex-dividend date was the third? Not sure why this is confusing me so much but I can’t really find an answer anywhere for what seems like a simple question."

"Time to sell/reallocate? Hi, there!

I started investing a few years ago, going with a core+satellite strategy from a mentor. About one year ago I changed into a more VT & chill thing (VOO+VEA, no VWO because I have exposure to emergents elsewhere). Some ETFs (VGT+QQQM) were doing well, so I left them there.

It's time for me to rebalance, and I felt sorry for my tech ETFs, because they are doing so well:

Rounding:  
55% VOO - Up 26%  
21% VEA - Up 24%  
7% VGT - Wanted to double the ante on tech at the time, up 131%  
7% QQQM - same, up 58%  
9% AVUV - Small cap value, instead of VWO, up 7%

Is it time to sell VGT and QQQM? Just leave them there? Something else?

Thanks"

"Brand New, Risk-Tolerant Investor Seeking Maximum Expected Value but Unsure of the Optimal Strategy Hi, I'm a 27-year-old with no previous investing experience looking to start investing. I started my first serious full-time job at the beginning of this year, in a career with very high growth potential (barring unprecedented effects of AI). I've saved $20,000-50,000 so far in my checking account, which doubles as my emergency fund (but I have a robust safety net, so I don't need to be overly concerned with my emergency fund). I max out my company match of 5% for my 401(k). I'm intending to max out my Roth IRA annually, and put the remainder in a standard brokerage account, both through Charles Schwab. I haven't invested anything yet, other than in my 401(k). My initial investment will be a lump sum (the amount I would have invested by now), then dollar-cost averaging going forward.

My plan was to begin investing right away, but I've been holding off due to the looming substantial market correction as a result of the massive and widespread overvaluation of AI and AI-related equities. For the record, I am a firm believer in the long-term future potential of AI, but the unbelievable amount of money companies have been pouring into the research and development of AI has yielded disproportionately low returns thus far, and I believe the stock prices will fall drastically before the true AI breakthroughs are made. I am a believer in ""time in the market beats timing the market"" as a general rule, but do not want to put all my money into the stock market only for it to crash immediately afterward and I lose all that money. However, I also do not want to sit on my hands and miss out on crucial years of early growth waiting for a crash that might never even happen (but probably will, sooner than later). Therefore, I am unsure of what to do right now, until the correction happens.

My goal is simple: maximize long-term expected value. I am risk-tolerant; whatever gets me to that end goal (I am willing to take huge and/or frequent steps backward along the way as long as in the end I'm as much further ahead of where I started as I can possibly be). I'm also not impulsive in the slightest. I'd describe myself as patient, rational, and disciplined; the risk I'm willing to take is a function of both the reward and the probability (I won't risk everything for a disproportionately small chance of life-changing wealth, but I also won't indefinitely sit idly by while growth opportunities pass me by left and right).

A more specific, secondary goal would be: in 15-20 years, I dream of living in a 4,000+ square-foot house with a big yard in a pretty neighborhood in a thriving small suburban town with a wife and children.

I've done a fair amount of research and it seems the best strategy for me might be to invest 100% in ETFs such as VOO, VTI, VT, and/or VXUS. But I also know that the US market, especially the S&P 500, is heavily carried by AI spending, and I've received advice from people in-the-know to invest elsewhere until a correction occurs, since the market is historically expensive at the moment and a crash could occur at any time.

As someone just starting out, with so much conflicting information and advice out there, I'm struggling to filter out the noise and figure out what's really the optimal course of action for me right now. I'd be happy to engage in further discussion on this topic and/or provide any more context that would be helpful. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much for your time!

TL;DR: 27M, new to investing, patient, rational, risk-tolerant, and long-term focused with lofty goals. Torn between starting now with index fund(s) (e.g. VOO/VTI/VT) or waiting for a potential AI-driven market correction. Seeking advice on optimal entry strategy."
"I have $10,000 for my newborn, what is the best way to invest it? This account will be considered the baby’s money. Maybe one day for a down payment for a house, or however he wants to spend it when he is an adult.

What etf portfolio would you create for this scenario?

I’ve been investing mostly in individual stocks for the past few years, but I’m thinking it’s time to simplify and diversify a bit. I’ve got around **$500k** in my account, and I’m looking to shift roughly **$350k** of that into **ETFs**.

I’m aiming for **solid diversification** and **lower risk** not trying to time the market or chase crazy returns anymore. I’d rather have steady, broad exposure and let it grow.

Right now I’m thinking about a mix of:  
  
\-VTI or SCHB  
\-VXUS, IXUS, or something similar

But I’m seeking thoughts on how you think best to restructure a portfolio with that amount if the goal is to diversify and keep the risks lower.

Any insights would be great to hear. Thank you"
"Need help investing I’m a 42f recently a widow. I just put $32,400 in a rollover IRA account and I don’t know where to invest it.

"29M - EU / Looking to add more 'risk' / growth to my portfolio Hi!

**About me: 29 M - EU / Finland with a long career ahead of me. No debt. Decent risk tolerance.**  
  
**I'm not about to touch my investments, they're in for the long haul with some room for adjustments.**

I've been saving for a while, I was able to luckily enough to 'time' the market when I changed broker earlier this year and re-entered it.

The title explains most of it. I'm looking to add some more growth to my portfolio. My core is SPYI (SPDR MSCI ACWI IMI UCITS) which sits at around 31.5k€ and then I have a measly \~500 € invested in to IB1T ETP.

I'm really comfortable with my core, maybe too comfortable, I feel like adding a tilt which is more aggressive could add some growth.

I'm currently investing 500 € / month (not taking in to account excess funds that I lumpsum when I feel like it is a good time) at a steady pace, everything is allocated towards SPYI.  
I also save \~100 € / month in cash, growing my liquid funds. My emergency fund is OK.

I'm thinking to split my 500 € / month so that \~250 € goes towards SPYI and the rest would go towards a satellite that is more growth focused, until I reach around a 10 % allocation.

I'm looking for ideas that could work when it comes to adding some growth to my portfolio.

Every opinion and thought is more than welcome! :)"

3. Is it ever a good idea to buy crypto or gold etfs, planning on investing a small percentage in them. In my country there’s no direct way to trade btc hence the thought of doing it through etfs.

"23 y/o with $150k to invest in ETFs next week – aiming to buy a house in 4 years Hey everyone,

I’m 23 and will have around $150,000 ready to invest starting next week. My goal is to grow this money over the next 3–4 years, since I’d like to buy my first home around age 26–27.

I’m okay with taking some risk, but I don’t want to do anything reckless. I know 3–4 years is a pretty short time frame for investing, but I aim to go for ETF since it’s more simple than regular stocks (I work so I don’t have enough time to put in it).

The thing is, I’m still new to ETFs — I understand the basics of index funds and diversification, but I’m not sure how to actually build a portfolio with them !

So I’d really appreciate your thoughts on:
	•	How many ETFs should I go for ?
	•	Are there any specific ETFs you’d recommend for someone in this position?

For instance, I am thinking going SPX and VWO (70%, 30%)

Any advice, examples, or general tips are super welcome — I’m here to learn before jumping in.

Thanks a lot in advance! 🙏"

"Roast my portfolio (first time poster) I've been scrolling this subreddit for a long time and I'm just curious what opinions people would have about my allocation. Goal is to keep close to global market cap weights of 65% US 35% INTL, but heavily tilted towards value.

"Strategy Pivot - Lowering risks - 1 ETF or 3 ETF? **Hello,**

I’m looking for advice on adjusting my investment strategy.

My core conviction is semiconductors, and I’ve held **VVSM** for a few years now—needless to say, it’s performed well. However, I’m now considering a shift toward **lower risk and broader diversification**.

I see two possible paths:

**Option 1:**  
Start investing in **VWCE** (or a similar global ETF) and continue building that position. Occasionally, I’d add to my existing semiconductor ETF.

**Option 2:**  
Hold **VWCE** as a core, and complement it with more targeted ETFs like **EIMI** (emerging markets) and **SXRA** (real estate), to diversify across regions and sectors.

What would you suggest?

*P.S. I’m also building a Python script to back-test both strategies.*"

"Young, Risk-On Portfolio Allocation I am a young, risk-on investor looking to maximize long-term growth while maintaining balanced exposure. I am pretty confident on my allocations but have two questions.

10% FTEC  
10% VEA  
10% VWO  
5% IBIT

1. Should I swap VTI for VOO to flush out the small-cap growth? Or does VTI provide better diversified exposure for the long haul (i.e. mid-caps)?
2. Increase AVUV to 15% by decreasing 55% -> 50%? Seems like small-cap value is best bet for my long-term goals, but the recent extended underperformance is daunting. Regardless, what's the best balance? The answer could depend on whether VTI or VOO is selected.

"Looking for QII-optimized U.S. Treasury ETFs for non-U.S. investors Hi everyone,

I’m a non-U.S. investor looking to park USD in short-term Treasury ETFs that minimize or avoid U.S. withholding tax on distributions.

From what I understand, some ETFs classify most of their payouts as Qualified Interest Income (QII) or interest-related dividends, which are not subject to the 30% withholding for foreign investors under section 871(h).

I’m mainly considering TFLO, USFR, SHV, BIL, SGOV, GBIL, and SGVT — but it’s not clear which of them actually distribute QII (and what percentage of their income is treated that way).

Does anyone have recent data or firsthand experience with these ETFs in 2024–2025? Are there specific tickers that are better QII-optimized or known to have 100% of their distributions classified as QII?

Also interested in UCITS alternatives that achieve a similar goal with cleaner tax treatment for non-U.S. investors.

"Gold/Bitcoin Exposure I am studying the possibility of allocating a small portion (around 5%) of my portfolio to gold/bitcoin with the aim of benefiting from the negative correlation with stocks in general, plus increased profitability due to the risk/return ratio.

In this topic I would like to discuss a few issues, namely:

Do you hold gold/bitcoin in your portfolio? If so, what percentage do you hold, and what is your outlook for the future of these two assets, knowing that they are currently at their all-time highs?

Do you invest directly (using ETFs, for example GLD and FBTC) or through leverage? I recently discovered some leveraged ETFs that I'm analyzing and I'd like to discuss them here:

* **GDE - WisdomTree Efficient Gold Plus Equity Strategy Fd:**
   * For each $100 invested, the fund aims to allocate about **$90 into large-cap U.S. equities** plus **$90 of gold futures exposure**, with \~$10 in high-quality cash or short-term money-market collateral. This creates \~1.8× total exposure (i.e., $180 of exposure for each $100 invested);
   * Expense ratio is relatively low (0.20%) given the strategy;
* **RSSX - Return Stacked US Stocks & Gold/Bitcoin ETF:**
   * Designed to give investors roughly **$1 worth of exposure to a U.S. large-cap equity strategy** \+ **$1 worth of exposure to a gold/bitcoin strategy**, for each $1 invested;
   * The Gold/Bitcoin part uses a risk-parity framework: it dynamically allocates between gold and bitcoin exposure so that each contributes roughly equally to the volatility of that component;
   * The gold/bitcoin strategy typically allocates between **\~75-95% to gold** and **\~5-25% to bitcoin**, though this can shift as volatility forecasts change;
   * Expense ratio: 0.68%;
* **BTGD - STKd 100% Bitcoin & 100% Gold ETF:**
   * For each $1 invested — i.e., roughly $2 of underlying exposure per $1 of fund assets (leveraged notionally) under normal circumstances;
   * BTGD does **not invest directly** in spot Bitcoin or physical gold. Instead, it uses a combination of *futures contracts*, derivatives, and pooled investment vehicles / ETPs to achieve its exposure;
   * Expense ratio: 0.99%;

# My Conclusions

[In another thread here I commented on the study regarding ""optimized bitcoin allocation""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1okimnk/vt_btc_optimized_allocation/) and, in short, the conclusion was about 5%.

[In another thread I discussed whether the GDE is a substitute for the core US allocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1oe9nyz/can_gde_be_a_substitute_for_us_allocation_in_a/) of a portfolio. With a simulation since 1968, a leveraged allocation of 90+90 SP500+Gold resulted (compared to the SP500) in a 30.5% higher CAGR (14.09% x 10.79%) with 36.60% higher volatility.

Gold has greater confidence as a store of value than bitcoin, which has not yet proven itself as a ""medium of exchange"" (at least globally) and which is still, in my view, in a speculative environment. On the other hand, I do believe that bitcoin, unlike 99% of other cryptocurrencies, has a reserved space as something useful in society (in the future).

If I were to use GDE in my portfolio, I would allocate a portion larger than 5%. Something around 20-30% of my US allocation (which respects the global market capitalization, so we're talking about a total of around 60-65%).

For RSSX, it would be similar, however, as it's riskier (because of Bitcoin), this allocation would be around 10-20% of my US allocation.

Now, for my ""riskier portion"" mentioned above, I will study whether to continue with 100% BTC (using the FBTC ETF) or with BTGD. The discussion in this thread will help me with this decision."

No rush and the goal is to have some fuck you money in 20- 30 years (quit corporate when it is too much to spending quality time with family, where we live the retirement age is 67). 

Thanks in advance."
"SPLG name change to SPYM is a very good move For all my holders, this could potentially put WAY more volume in the ETF. Additionally, more free marketing whenever someone types in SPY."
Thoughts on this Pie??? Would appreciate your opinions on these picks and weightings. Uk investor. 25Yo.
"Why nothing compares to the S&P500? I’ve been looking into making a portafolio mix for a retirement account. My final ETF choices are VUG, SCHD, VBK, and VXUS for a 40+ years account. 

The question is, is it really worth it to make a proper asset allocation when looking at the historical returns nothing seem to bit a “100%” VOO/QQQ allocation. 

Any advice or comments will be appreciated."

"Discussion about momentum ETFs I've noticed that SPMO has become very popular in this subreddit. And no wonder, [it has managed to beat all the metrics](https://testfol.io/?s=kMwsFZzsmiC) (except volatility and beta) of the S&P 500 since its inception.

https://preview.redd.it/xndzwky0cgyf1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=724d9f93ee44f7614cfcc3e91c79a713bd0f470f

However, he is not the only one in the category. And what I want to discuss in this topic is: ""Are we investing in the momentum characteristic/factor or just in the SPMO?""

https://preview.redd.it/1n087ldsbhyf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7445c38ef3eac0cd7228be40bc55516a70e95f0f

  
It's easy to see that Invesco's methodology has managed to outperform the S&P 500 index (virtually) since its inception.

[VOO's annual return was better in the years 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/i8olea59chyf1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a023649a8904b9fc2752085ca9e30e12a679e35)

What I'd like to discuss here is: **if you invest in SPMO relying on Invesco's momentum strategy/methodology, why not do the same for other geographies?**

Below is a comparison of the index-neutral ETF, the Avantis approach, the Invesco momentum approach.

# Conclusions

* SPMO has achieved a better final result than the neutral index since its creation. However, it had 4 out of 10 years with a lower result.
* The IDMO curve only surpassed the neutral index in February 2024.
* EEMO, when compared to the neutral index since its creation, has had the worst result of all. It has practically remained stagnant for the last 10 years.

Do you invest in momentum factors beyond the US? I see IDMO mentioned here and there, but I don't recall anyone commenting on EEMO.

The point of my discussion is that Invesco's momentum methodology should work in any geography. If you invest in a neutral index in the US and tilt towards momentum, if you invest ex-US (which is recommended), the ""right"" thing to do would be to do the same tilts here as well. Or not?"

"I plan on creating a “higher risk” portfolio with my retirement accounts I have been investing in garbage for my Roth and traditional IRAs for the past few years, I opened them at 18 and had no clue what I was doing it was more a set it and forget about it when I was in the military. Anyway here we are today I am 23 and have been researching so much the last few months about investing and finally made the push to opening an individual investment account for “safe stocks” basically big companies that hopefully won’t ever go under but I have about 25k split between my Roth and traditional IRAs. Long story short I’m NOT going to be funding my traditional for the next few years I am in college (about 2.5 left) since I will use my workplace 401k after I get done with college. I plan to dump 500 into my Roth and get to the 7k by the end of the year with whatever contributions I still will need to make. I am thinking about putting 30% into QQQM 25% into QTUM 25% into VOO and 20% into VTI. The goal now is to have a little more risk and start hitting the brakes about 5 years before retirement in 30 years. Let me know what your general consensus is. I would like to grow my wealth as effectively and efficiently as possible and avoid bonds for a few years. Thank you. 

TLDR; I sort of know what I’m doing🤣"

I'm from China, in the economically developed Bay Area. I'm 34 and married.

My income is $23k/month after tax (IT job, the ""IT 35 curse"") + $8k/month housing fund. My wife works for a company (stable job) and earns $13k/month after tax + $4k/month housing fund.

We own two properties. One is our primary residence with a $1 million mortgage, with a monthly payment of $4k.

The other is a property worth approximately $1.6 million, with the mortgage fully paid off (purchased for $2.4 million, currently still declining, uncertain if it will recover). It's currently rented out for $3k/month. There are no taxes or fees on properties in China.

Our current living expenses are $5k-6k/month. We currently invest $10k/month in ETFs, with the rest in cash savings. I'd like to ask if we should sell one of the properties and invest the proceeds in ETFs.

"Dave Ramsey Mutual Funds Portafolio Mimic ETFs Which are the best ETFs to mimic Dave Ramsey bucket mix of 25/25/25/25 Growth & Income, Growth, Aggresive Growth, and International?

What are your thoughts? What would you change and why? Open to criticism. I’m also looking at the fact that a simpler 50/50 between SPYG and QQQM would just give higher return anyways."

"Has government issued debt ever outperformed a index ETF over 25 years? So here is the question I am mulling over - this is a bit UK centric but you can probably extend the question to US government debt too.

Over an extended time frame - let's say 25 years because that is roughly my retirement - including dividend distributions from an ETF (or accumulation) and coupons from the bonds - has government debt ever outperformed a index based ETF? 

I am thinking of VUKE and VUSA as obvious examples (currently I am 1/3x VUKE, 1/3x VUSA, 1/6x XS2D and 1/6 LUK2).

The reason I wonder this is that I have 3X in my pension today, and I am questioning whether it would ever be a good idea to put 1X into a 25 year maturing government bond (GILT) that has a 4.5% compounding return.

Or, historically, has there never been a year where that was a 'positive' outcome play?

Obviously some factors exist here - like - the ETF market has only existed for 35 years - so maybe this is a ""compared to the S&P, FTSE100 or Nikkei"". But I am not sure the best place to find this source this data."

"Is it worth investing in different ETFs when they move the same way? For instance I want to get into CIBR for cybersecurity, but the ETF basically moved the same (up and down) as VUG SCHG VOO and FTEC or SPMO in the last 5 years.

And considering FTEC and SPMO all have seen higher gains than CIBR… why bother with CIBR at all?"

"Dead 401k > IBIT? FBTC? I have the opportunity to transfer an inactive 401k from a previous employer into an IRA without incurring tax, and then flipping that into IBIT.

I currently have a good diversification in actual crypto, but I’m under exposed to BTC and could invest about as much into IBIT with this account as the price of a single BTC now. 

I am well employed and have another larger active traditional 401k in a separate account. 

I don’t have that liquid, so this seems like an obvious move (I have a high risk tolerance atm and am a strong believer in the future of BTC) 

I am in fidelity. IBIT vs FBTC?

VPU or VHT best defensive ETF? Should I pick VPU or VHT? I like both. I have VOO and VGT both in my brokerage and Roth IRA. I have VT in my Roth IRA. I am thinking to put VPU or VHT in the brokerage account as the defensive ETF.
"Will ETF of the energy sector include nuclear companies in the future? I'm planning to invest some money in 5MVW, it currently holds mostly oil, coal and natural gas companies.

Nuclear and green energy are considered utilities, not energy sources, in the context of ETF inclusion.

ETFs like 5MVW will basically go bankrupt and will get delisted when we run out of fossil fuels, while green and nuclear energy are still considered utilities, meaning they don't fit the criteria of ETFs like 5MVW and won't be included in such ETFs.

To the best of my knowledge, no energy ETF actually includes nuclear and green companies (they are considered utilities), and all such ETFs stick to the traditional industry, that is, fossil fuels. Can this change in the future?"

I’m also wondering if I should stick to just three ETFs. I’m planning to invest around $300–$400 per month, but I’m not sure if I’m spreading my investments too thin. My main core is VOO/VTI, QQQ, and VXUS. I’ll probably just add about 10% to SCHD and BND. Thanks."

"VT + BTC ""Optimized Allocation"" It's rather complicated to backtest using Bitcoin's historical data and not arrive at the conclusion that ""the optimized allocation would be 100% Bitcoin."" After all, knowing the future makes it easy to get rich.

However, even at practically the highest peak this asset has ever reached and knowing the (certain) negative correlation it has with stocks, I wanted to do a quick study/backtest. An inspiration was the article ""[Bitcoin's Role in a Traditional Portfolio](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/static.bitwiseinvestments.com/Research/Bitcoins-Role-in-a-Traditional-Portfolio-062025.pdf),"" which I started reading but haven't finished yet.

I made some conservative allocations between VT and BTC, and the results were as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/wsa5cq7hscyf1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe3f3734a14d7e55cb5d8d7b772899698e2aecf7

The performance of a 100% BTC portfolio is almost ridiculous. And that's without even considering monthly contributions, based on an initial investment of $10,000 in 2010. I truly believe there are people who have earned over $10 billion with Bitcoin. But okay, that's not the point of this topic.

The goal here is to ""find/discuss an optimized allocation,"" and with that, to find the correct risk-adjusted return ratio. Because the surreal CAGR of 147% also came with a maximum drawdown of 93.24% and a volatility of 99.02%, values ​​that I believe nobody would want to see in a retirement portfolio.

Therefore, the 95/5 allocation seemed interesting to me. The final return was 60% higher (than 100% VT), but the maximum drawdown and volatility remained very similar. Furthermore, all other metrics (sharpe, sortino, calmar, etc.) were also better.

>Note: all VT/BTC allocations mentioned in the graph above **had monthly rebalancing**. This was very important for the results obtained due to Bitcoin's volatility. Below are the results obtained with the 95/5 allocation using different rebalancing windows.

https://preview.redd.it/wi8rawf4ucyf1.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0fe028cf02f8295391c3687dcf42efc2e607a

It is noticeable that holding BTC in the wallet (at least in the past) required a ""more active"" portfolio management (in the sense of always moving excess profits from BTC to VT) in order not to compromise maximum drawdown and volatility.

Finally, I'd like to end this post with a few questions. Feel free to answer them or contribute to the discussion in whatever way you prefer.

* Do you still believe that BTC, with this more active/frequent rebalancing approach, can be a viable option in a long-term portfolio?
* The total gain from BTC was around 24,000%. Is it safe to say that future profitability (over a long timeframe, 10-30 years) will be VERY different from that? In the sense that it will no longer be worthwhile?
   * What I mean here is whether you're on the team that believes ""it's going to go higher"" or ""it's already at the very top, from here on it's only downhill."" I don't expect to find the answer to the future here, but rather everyone's opinion.
* Do you have any other ideas for how to ""optimize"" this ""5% risk allocation"" for the future? With some other asset/commodity/ETF etc. that isn't Bitcoin?"
