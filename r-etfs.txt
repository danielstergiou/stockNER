"In April I almost sold the dip. Now I'm 12% up. Around the start of April, I threw all my savings into an ETF. 18 hours later the Trump Tariffs begin and the market falls. I was down thousands of dollars but was planning to hold. Then Saturday came around and reddit was being flooded with posts of how the economy was officially over. The next day I put in a sell order at a significant loss (Market was closed thankfully).

After a lot of thinking that night, I cancelled the sell order and wrote a long message in my notepad to read in case the market took a turn again. The note was to remind me to not sell, and to keep DCA'ing. That I had already weighed in on the risks prior to investing, **when I was in a more rational headspace.** I kept DCA'ing and never needed to look at that note again, and I'm up 12% now.

I'm not writing this to brag, but to caution. Because after last weeks dip, this subreddit started to look eerily similar to April. Mind you it was a 2% dip. That's like the price of an iPhone going from $1250 to $1225. You would laugh if a store offered that as a discount and yet some of the people on this sub could be perfectly described by this one image:

Investing in ETFs means you've made a prediction that the market will be higher in 10+ years time. Trump will not be alive. Your ETF might be worth tenfold. Or the asteroid might hit us and we'll all be dead. DCA and tune out the noise."
"is QQQI the best passive income ETF? honestly it seems that way

14.56% per year yield, paid as monthly dividends so 1.21% per month in passive income

since inception the etf is up 4.90% in value, the share price just does not get eroded over time, it actually ends up going up a bit which is fantastic

also the way the yields are taxed apparently allows you to keep more of the income

this looks like such a good passive income generator. get $300k and just put it on this, generate $3.6k a month passively"
"India May Face 50%+ Tariffs. New Trade War to Begin. Trump Argues that India is funding deaths in Ukraine and therefore raising taxes on them. There are multiple sensitive areas that could be impacted if Tariffs go very high on India, like cheap medicines could get expensive.  
India shows no intention to bow down in any way and make a deal with USA, i.e., continuing to make low-cost Russian oil purchases to keep inflation in check. No way things can get resolved soon. Let's see how to play out. How to play this news and suggestions?"
"Is VT the best “one ETF to rule them all,” or too broad to be efficient? I’ve been thinking about simplifying my portfolio and holding just VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) long term. On paper, it seems perfect: global diversification, automatic rebalancing, and low fees. One ETF and done.

But I’m wondering… does VT include too much ""dead weight""?
Developed markets with low growth, small positions in frontier/emerging markets that barely move the needle.

Curious to hear what others think — anyone here gone all-in on VT? Any regrets? Or do you prefer slicing it up for more control?

PS: I hold VT and I'm based in EU"
"Does it make sense pairing a growth fund with a momentum fund? Something like QQQ and SPMO together? QQQ follows the top 100 US companies while SPMO follows the S&P 500 Momentum Index. 

I was thinking something like 

55% VTI

15% QQQ

10% SPMO

20% VXUS

Is is too much unnecessary overlap? I want my core fund to be VTI, but I want to tilt to the tech heavy NASDAQ 100 and momentum stocks in the S&P500. There is no finance sector in QQQ while SPMO has 20% in finance. There are 13 holdings between the two funds that overlap. Any thoughts?"
"Index Funds for future Do we think that the Stock Market will truly continue to grow for the next 40+ years? Are we true to expect 7% rates annually (on average) from the S&P 500? I truly just wonder the true likelihood that it will simply continue to grow. Almost everything stops growing after a while, what makes we sure that the market will continue to go up? What will happen to VOO in the next 40 years?"
"QGRO equivalent? Really happy with my qgro position, but I’ve been looking for a fund that’s close to it but with a bit more liquidity and volume.

"SPDR MSCI ACWI vs Vanguard FTSE All-World (via InvestEngine), which would you go for? Hi all. I’m a 22 year old who has, over the past few years, been taking control of my finances to set myself up for the future.

After thorough research on platforms, I’m planning to invest long-term through InvestEngine, using a stocks and shares ISA and SIPP. Initial contribution of £300/month (£150 each) and increasing this over time (every year by £50-£100 in each until happy).

The main two I’ve been looking at are SPDR MSCI ACWI (SSAC, 0.12% TER,  IE00B44Z5B48) and Vanguard FTSE All-World (VWRP, 0.22% TER, IE00BK5BQT80). I’ve also been considering Invesco FTSE All-World (FWRG, TER 0.15%, IE000716YHJ7). I’m also open to ANY suggestions. 

My goal is simple long-term growth, 100% stocks, accumulating, global diversification. 

I understand VWRP has more holdings (3,600 vs 2,200) and includes more mid-caps than SSAC. Though I know mid-caps have historically outperformed, I’m not sure how significant that is here, since they only make up a portion of the ETF.

In turn, I’d end up with a slightly more diversified portfolio with VWRP, but not sure if that’s enough to justify the higher 0.22%? 

I’m leaning towards SSAC due to the lower fee, but just wanted to run it through this sub before I do. It just seems as if SPDR isn’t on the radar, wondering if I’m missing something? 

I may have made a few mistakes in this post, so please let me know if anything I’ve mentioned isn’t correct! Thanks in advance, looking forward to hearing your thoughts."

"Does QQQI break the 4% rule? Since the covered called funds like QQQI pay over 10%, a smaller amount of capital can help one meet their income needs. By taking the distributions in cash if those distributions exceed the “4% rule“ but still leaves you at 2/3 of your portfolio for growth, emergencies, etc. is this a feasible strategy or do you run the risk of spending too much money and getting into trouble down the road? I’m 34 months from being fully retired."
"Rating my 401k Funds These are through an employer 401k. I am getting solid 20% annual returns in my 401k but just learned about fund overlap. I looked these up and they don’t appear to overlap. I just shifted over to the Nuveen and Fidelity Advisor as they are newer funds offered. These are the top performing funds I have access to. They are higher risk but overall they keep growing. Other than balancing out the portfolio between these, am I doing the right thing just running with these 4 for now? I’m 44M so I’m way behind and just increased my withholdings to 10% and another 5% into a Roth. 14% would max my 401k so I’m working my way there. 5% does max out my Roth contributions."
New portfolio - Finding equivalent ETFs that you can invest in within a UK ISA I have settled on this as my new portfolio with allocations shown.

"International Comeback? Yes, this will be a speculation type post. Mainly wanted to ask what people suspect is most likely to happen between US and ex-US equity markets over the next 10-20 years. These past 15 years have been dominated by the US market due mostly to shifting price multiples, which have adjusted to account for new earnings growth expectations. If we assume that adjustment has been more/less completed, then we should soon see an equalization in total returns between US and ex-US going forward

Also, wondering why ex-US has underperformed for the past 30 years. How much of that underperformance can be attributable to the Japan bubble of 1990? I think Japan's market accounted for like 45% of the world's market cap at the peak, so probably like 70-80% of all ex-US equities at the time. So with most ex-US equity markets today starting with lower price multiples, there should be a lot more upside potential

Lemme know if you disagree with my bullish international sentiment. Will respond only to those who have solid, insightful comments..."
"Would greatly appreciate some advice Hi everyone! I am new to investing and I would love some advice on how to start! Generally looking to try out the conventional method of 60:40 Equity to Bond ratio for ETFs.

1) These are some of the ETFs/Indexes/Funds I am currently tracking. Would you think these are great candidates?

2) I’m not too sure when I should start cashing in as the price seems to be growing upwards constantly and I believe I should avoid buying it on a high? However, the chances of it dipping seem rare as well. Would love some insight!

"VYMI vs LVHI, which is the superior international position? Both VYMI and LVHI have outperformed VXUS over their lifetimes while also providing simarly high dividends but now my question is which of the two is better overall?

VYMI has more companies (1500+) but is highly concentrated into one sector (40% in finance) due to no limiters. However, it does also allow for emerging markets which LVHI does not.

LVHI on the otherhand has outperformed VYMI and VXUS while having a significantly lower drawdown and standard deviation. It does not allow for extreme concentrations into any one sector or country either too. However with only 180 or so companies and using the US dollar, diversification is hindered."

"Roth IRA Allocation Advice – Stick with DGRO & VYM or Add More? Hey everyone,

I’m 28 and just getting serious about investing a little late, but better late than never, right?

Right now, I have a Roth IRA where I’m holding DGRO and VYM. My current strategy has been to just consistently contribute and build positions in those two ETFs.

I like the dividend growth focus of DGRO and the high yield exposure of VYM, but I’ve been wondering should I keep it simple and just continue dollar-cost averaging into those two? Or would it be smart to diversify a bit more and add another ETF like SPYI, or maybe something else you all suggest?

My goal is long-term growth with dividend income in retirement.

Appreciate any input. Thanks in advance!"
"Looking for UCITS ETFs similar to Vanguard LifeStrategy or Target Date funds (available in Europe) Hi everyone,

I’m based in Europe and I’m looking for UCITS-compliant ETFs that resemble either:
	•	Vanguard LifeStrategy funds (e.g. static diversified portfolios like 60/40 or 80/20 equity/bonds), or
	•	Target Date / Glide Path funds like BlackRock LifePath or Vanguard Target Retirement, which gradually become more conservative over time.

I use a broker like IBKR. and I’m specifically interested in ETFs available to EU residents, ideally listed on European exchanges (Xetra, LSE, Borsa Italiana, etc).

Any recommendations for:

"Starting young but lots of wasted time I’m 24 now but will be 25 tomorrow. I opened a Roth IRA account when I was 18 just to see what I could do with it. I bought a couple stocks, panic sold when they dipped, and never touched it again. Fast forward until 2 weeks ago. An older gentleman at work was talking about retirement and it reminded me I had a Roth. Logged in to see $750 just sitting there doing nothing. So I bought SCHG and SCHD. Then a couple days ago I deposited $550 and bought SCHX and some more SCHD and SCHG. I feel like I missed out on so much growth potential and I can’t help but to feel like I’m playing catch up. 

My plan going forward is to max out my Roth every year and buy those three ETF’s. I don’t really know what I’m doing but I heard somewhere that time in the market beats timing the market so as long as I’m constantly investing, I’ll come out ahead when retirement age hits. 

Tldr: I squandered 6 years of growth. Now what?"

Roth IRA in Fidelity I am currently 20M and I have a Roth IRA opened in Fidelity with about 1k to start that going. I obviously cant touch this money until 40 years in the future so I wonder if something as simple as VOO in my roth ira will beat everything over the next 40 years and be sitting at about 1.8m adjusted for inflation when i’m ready to retire because i don’t plan to retire until i’m around 60. I have more money to start investing in a webull brokerage to have some fun and make more money. Is this a solid plan moving forward and also for my brokerage what should i invest in?
"21M: Need Roth IRA Strategy Advice I did some light research on ETFs awhile ago for my ROTH IRA for retirement and came out with this split:

VOO 25%, 
SPMO 25%, 
IDMO 15%, 
VT 15%, 
AVMV 10%, 
AVUV 10%

Since then I’ve simply set it and forgotten it. My brokerage adds and automatically balances a lump out of my paycheck every month.

I want to do a research deep dive and rebalancing, so I can have some peace of mind that I actually gave my strategy some real thought. I understand that over time you’re supposed to rebalance towards wealth protection as opposed to growth, my questions are for the short term.

Should I be more aggressive given my age?
Should I be more exposed to international markets?
Should I not be invested in momentum ETFs as heavily for a ROTH?
Are there any overlapping investments that could be used to diversify elsewhere?
Should I just simplify it to like 3 etfs, and stop thinking about it?"
"Just starting out – VWRP or build my own ETF mix? Hi all,

I'm new to investing in the UK and planning to put in £50/month via Freetrade. I'm stuck between two options:

2. Build my own mix – VUSA (US), VJPN (Japan), BLND (UK REIT), and an ESG ETF.
I like the idea of keeping it simple with VWRP, but I’m also curious about picking a few UK dividend stocks later on to learn more.


Anyone else started like this?

I currently invest in AVUV, QQQ, SCHD, VOO, and VXUS to try to get a good diversity. Right now, each one has 20 percent of my total account.

"True Cost of Leveraged ETFs ## ⚡️ The hidden costs of leveraged ETFs

I have to tell y'all something I've ""discovered"" which, when you really think about it, is pretty obvious and logical, to be honest.

I have only just become aware of the trap that the stock market is for smaller, non-professional retail investors. It feels like there's an unspoken conspiracy to obscure key information from them, especially regarding the real costs. Through this, I've also come to understand just how important interest rates are and the dramatic impact they have on the entire stock market.

Let's go through it step by step:

### How can the cost of an ETF be 10% if the fee is only 0.15%?

I stumbled across a 5x leveraged ETF by chance and, wondering how they make money, looked through their official PDF document ([link here](https://lt.morningstar.com/1c6qh1t6k9/snapshotpdf/default.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&SecurityToken=0P0001O3WV9991DFXALL4ALL_1392&Id=0P0001O3WV&ClientFund=1&BaseCurrencyId=EUR&InvestmentType=FO)) and I was astonished by what I learned.

On the second page, in the top left corner, there's a section called 'How Much Does it Cost?'. Take note: the official management fee (Expense Ratio) is just 0.15%. But a few lines below, they state that the total annual cost of running the ETF (Ongoing Charge) is actually 9.75%! How?

### The cost of inflation

On top of all this, real inflation is NOT 2–3% as officially reported, but rather closer to 12–15% in countries like the US (see the [Chapwood Index](https://chapwoodindex.com/) for details), and probably much higher in other parts of the world.

### Why the Expense Ratio (ER) is practically irrelevant

It's obvious: the famous Expense Ratio (ER), which most people see as the main cost of an ETF, is actually an almost irrelevant detail that serves as a smokescreen when using a leveraged ETF.

## Explanation: The real annual cost of TQQQ (3x Nasdaq 100)

Here is a broken-down, specific example for the popular TQQQ:

1.  **Management fee (expense ratio)**  
is around 0.84–0.97%. This is the figure that is publicly displayed and known to us all, but it actually represents a ridiculously small part of the total cost.

2. **The main cost is in the interests**  
This is the key expense that is rarely mentioned. To achieve 3x leverage, TQQQ must use financial derivatives (swaps and futures), and the cost of this borrowing is short-term interest rate (e.g. the federal funds rate) plus around 0.5%. A rough calculation shows the cost for a 3x leveraged ETF to be approximately twice the benchmark interest rate. If the interest rate is 5%, this hidden cost is close to 10% per year — a figure which, of course, is not included in the Expense Ratio.

3. **Volatility decay**  
This is a well-known consequence of the daily rebalancing of leveraged ETFs. While not a direct cost, it is a mathematical reality that erodes returns over time. It is important to be aware that rebalancing takes place at the end of each day. Consequently, if the price rises for ten consecutive days, the return will be as expected. However, if the market is stagnant overall but volatile day by day, the return will be drastically lower, even if the underlying non-leveraged index is positive. I suspect that's why we have such violent ups and downs in prices, which is probably due to big investors making money from small investors.

> **Extreme example** of risk... If NASDAQ-100 (aka QQQ ETF) falls by 20%, the value of WisdomTree NASDAQ-100 5x Daily Leveraged (QSL5.DE) is theoretically almost wiped out, as 5 x -20% = -100%. This is why it is in this year down 23% when the non-leveraged QQQ is up 10%.

## Conclusion

The real annual cost of holding TQQQ is the sum of the listed items, which amounts to approximately 11–12% per year. This is a fixed 'burden' that you pay every year, regardless of whether the market is going up or down.

This is why a 2x leveraged ETF is somewhat more bearable, as the interest cost is half as much (around 5% at today's rates).

If you have enough money and therefore you're not using leverage, you don't incur this main hidden cost. Madness, isn't it?

### A bit more real-world maths...

Here are two examples that perfectly illustrate the point:

1.  Example from last year (a period of growth):  
    QQQ increased by ~27.2%. The expected return for TQQQ would be 3 x 27.2%, or 81.6%.
    However, the actual return on TQQQ was ~54.6%.
    That is a shortfall of 27 percentage points compared to the theoretical return, which is consistent with the calculation of hidden costs and volatility decay.
2.  Example from the start of the year to today (a period with a correction):  
    During this period, there was one significant correction, so the volatility decay was more pronounced. QQQ went up by ~8.5%. In that time, TQQQ returned only **~5.5%**. This is less than QQQ itself! In fact, QQQ at least covered the semi-annual inflation and TQQQ lost money in real terms.

## The advantage for those who have money

Those who have enough money from the start are at a huge advantage. They don't have to use expensive leveraged products or borrow from brokers through margin — in the EU, this is called a Lombard loan — thereby avoiding enormous costs.

- They don't use leveraged ETFs. This automatically saves them ~10% per year on hidden interest costs, for example those incurred by TQQQ.
- They don't use margin from their broker. This saves them an additional ~7% per year in interest on the loan.

Therefore, if you trade with TQQQ and are also on margin, you have to earn roughly 17% more than someone who does everything with their own money, just to be on a level playing field. Don't forget: if the year is flat, which is rare, you will still have lost 17%, whereas the rich guy will not.

"Any advice is appreciated My ROTH IRA is currently mostly VOO - Good amount of AVUV and a little bit of IBIT

In regular brokerage I have a bunch of single stocks of companies I really like and believe in. I don’t plan on touching any of this as I DCA into them along side what I invest in in my ROTH. 

I’m in my late 20s and want to take on as much risk as I can! 

I currently added JTEK in my ROTH as a large growth tech fund, is the 0.65% fee worth it? I believe in the companies and the future of tech just want to see if people are invested into other similar funds 

Im also thinking about adding SOXL into my roth instead of SMH, I know it is much more volatile and probably more day traded then it is maybe held for long term. Is it too risky? Is it better to not be leveraged positions even this early into investing for my retirement?

"Recommendations I've got $15k to invest. I'm 34 with solid retirement accounts with $100k+. So far, I have $7k in VOO and $3k in SCHG. Any recommendations for the last $5k? This is a non tax advantaged account that I'm putting some of my savings into to try and get some growth.

"What would be the best combo of BRK.B, S&P 500, Gold ETC, and Emerging Markets ETF? What would be the best combination of any of these to invest? How much on each? Why?

If there are a lot of companies that have P/E over 30 and even much more and the S&P 500 is built basically on these companies, would be a smart idea to buy S&P 500? Isn't it risky?

Some guys are talking that it would be a great idea to buy S&P 500 and ETC on Gold because when one is riding up the other is going down but it seems to me that both of them are going going up huge. How to do in this situation?

What do you think is going to happen and what is the best to do with your money?

Thank you in advance!"
"Supplement VOO with AI and military I've mainly been thinking about my investments as +10 or 20 years. However I recently thought that maybe I should diversify a bit.

I believe we're in an AI and arms race which will go on for at least the next 3-5 years and possible a lot longer.

To keep things simple I've previously been buying strictly VOO but now I'm thinking that I should start putting 25% in an AI ETF and 25% in a military related ETF. What do you guys think about this strategy? And if it make sense, which ETF's would you suggest?"
"25 and considering doing a 60/40 ETF split. Suggestions? So I was wondering if I should and what I should diversify it with. I understand that due to my age i'm in a fairly decent spot which is why I was going to hold off on diversifying. I was about to throw in another 8k or so and I thought why not do it now instead of later.  Looking for suggestions on what direction to look towards so I can do some research on it and go from there.

Across all accounts I have around 50k, that's including what I have in tsp. No access to a 401k yet and likely won't be in a position where I can contribute to roth ira for next 3-5 years, so my ""monthly portion towards retirement"" is going to be going towards ETF's for a while. Also a property I'm looking into

Also i'm not really in it for the quick buck either. I'm viewing all of this stuff as an alternate retirement plan that I have outside of my current ongoing stuff"

"Advice for investment on behalf of my 16 yr old Hello  
first time poster, thanks for providing wealth of info.  
I want to start investing on behalf of my 16 yr old.  
and time horizon of 15 yrs.  
I did not start any 529 or any other investment so this will be the primary investment for them.

I am 51 yr old.

I will start with a seed investment of 150K  
with 20K/per year additional investment.

Help needed  
a) should i just do VTI-100% or VTI 50% and QQQM 50% (whatever split i do for the seed investment, ill do the same for the yearlies.  
or 70% VTI + 20% QQQM + 10% VXUS   
b) i do believe that the tech market will have a growth run for the next 10 yrs, so if that's not captured in (a) then i can add to the funds being considered  
c) i want it to be passive other than me adding the yearly additions.  
d) where would i purchase these?

thanks again for input."
SMH ETF I’m 22 years old and I want exposure to semi conductors and tech stocks. AI is definitely the future for the next 10-15 years atleast. So is this a good etf to get exposure to or do you recommend any other ETFs. I know SCHG is good but its least weighted on semi conductors

"22M, What should I do? Hey everyone! 
 
I’m a 22 year old who just recently graduated college last year. I was able to get a job paying me roughly $90k a year pre tax. 

I have a buddy who graduated with a finance degree who constantly gives me recommendations. I take it all with a grain of salt considering he also just graduated and has little experience. 


Here is the portfolio he recommended. I have roughly $40k sitting in my checking account. Debt free. 


SCHG - Large Cap Growth 
SMH - Semi-conductor 
QQQ 
VDE - Energy 
VTV - Value 
GLD - Hold gold for inflation purposes. 

Open to hearing opinions. Goal is to retire before 65, have a luxury vehicle, and make the people around me happy."

"Late start on retirement Alright, I'm getting a late start on retirement. I've been binge researching the past month, maybe it's become paralysis by analysis but I am trying to really understand my options. I'm 43. I plan to open a Roth IRA. I've been reading and researching on Google and Chat GPT. I had thought SCHD might be the answer but when I ran simulations it seems mediocre at best.

I asked Chat GPT to give me the most aggressive growth options, regardless of risk. It provided me with a portfolio with TQQQ, SOXL and SMH. It gives me warnings that there is risk involved here, but I wanted to come here and engage with people who have experience on this subject and see what you guys think. I want to be aggressive. I know the future is unknown, but I don't know the practical pros or cons of a leveraged ETF, which is what TQQQ and SOXL are. Is this insanity? Is that just ultra aggressive and as long as I don't have a weak stomach I will come out ahead?

Just hoping for some general guidance. Any constructive input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

What do you think of my portfolio? (I plan to add the all-world vanguard ETF as well). I’ll be a student for at least the next two years so my plan is to add 120€ to each of those ETFs every month.

Should I just stick with Voo/vti or should I add stuff like schg or spmo and Avuv?

"A Big Market Dip Might Be Coming This is just my opinion, but I think we're heading for a significant correction soon. I’m not claiming to time the market, but several things are making me cautious right now:

* Interest rates are still high and likely to stay that way
* Corporate earnings are slowing while valuations stay elevated
* Geopolitical tensions and instability are increasing
* Tariffs and trade restrictions are coming back into play
* Consumer debt is at record levels, and spending looks unsustainable
* Some sectors, especially tech, look very overheated

I’m not trying to spread fear — just sharing what I see and why I’m preparing myself mentally for a possible dip."
"What is in your Etf Portfolio? Share your favorite Picks and Why. Hi Investors,

I’m interested to hear about the types of ETFs everyone currently holds. My approach is Kinda straightforward: 90% allocated to VT (Total World Stock ETF), with the remaining 10% in BND (Total Bond Market ETF).

VT appeals to me due to its broad global equity exposure, effectively simplifying diversification. Meanwhile, BND offers a stabilizing element and some fixed income, which I consider great for weathering market volatility. My  goal is long-term capital appreciation, but I also value maintaining some portfolio balance.

A few points for discussion:

* What guides your decision-making process for determining your stock-to-bond ratio? Is it based on age, risk tolerance, or another framework?
* Do you prefer comprehensive global funds like VT, or do you favor constructing a mix of regional ETFs?
* How frequently do you rebalance your portfolio, and what criteria do you use?
* Are there any lesser-known ETFs you believe deserve greater attention?
* What is your strategy into international exposure within your portfolio?

I would appreciate hearing about others’ portfolio strategies and any insights you’re willing to share. Looking forward to the discussion.

P.S I have an custodial account, and is allocating 500 dollars per year for 50 Years what about you?"
"How to Utilize Robinhood Margin + Trust Fund I am 21 and I have about 30 grand invested in Robin Hood. I also have a $500,000 trust fund that I unfortunately will not get access to until I’m 30.

I’m looking for a scheme to take advantage of my margin.

I understand that I am super super blessed. I was thinking because Robin Hood only charges 5% interest that I could take take 30 grand of margin and throw it in some secure fixed return that is above 5%.

I was considering doing some BDC’s but then I noticed that after the dividend pays out the stock drops.

I considered throwing some in stable coins, but Robin Hood doesn’t pay out on those.

I considered looking into some bonds, but it was really hard for me to find reliable non-junk bonds that had a yield higher than 5%.

I could throw them into equities, but that really isn’t worth the risk in my opinion. 

also the advice to just wait for the trust fund is cool and all, but does not have to do with my question."

So Im quite new to the market, I have 50 SPY etfs and I thought to myself- why SPY over QQQ? correct me if Im wrong but tech is what takes SPY up by the most isnt it? Im not saying that other sectors doesnt add to the index but if so why wouldnt I just buy QQQ to make it 100% tech and thats it.

I know that QQQ tends to be more risky but I have a lot of time ahead in the market.

"Allocation Advise Request Hello! Could you please share your thoughts on this portfolio?

* 35% | SPTM - S&P 1500 TOTAL US MARKET
* 35% | SPMO - US S&P 100 MOMENTUM
* 10% | AVDE - INTL EX-US EQUITY
* 10% | IDMO - INTL S&P 200 MOMENTUM
* 5% | JAAA - J.H. AAA CLO ETF
* 5% | FSCO - INTL FIXED INCOME CEF

Age 25, retiring in 30-35 years ideally.

I’m figuring this gives me the popular consensus of a good portfolio, 70% US Equities, 20% International Equities, 10% Bonds & Fixed Income.

Two solid low cost total market funds plus momentum for the periods that those outperform, plus bonds/fixed income for less drawdown + compounding dividends. Can rebalance this over time to allocate more towards bonds as I’m nearing retirement.

Anything I should change or weight differently?
Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

"Keep my VOO only or sell and buy VTI+VXUS? Hey everyone! 

Following most advice given here on the sub ive been buying for a year and a half now VOO each month when my paycheck arrives.

But lurking through most recent posts, many people say I could be missing out on possible gains by not buying international.

Because ive spent so little time until now buying, I think I'm still in a position to migrate to other stocks or even start buying others.

So, what would you say? These would be my options

- Keep buying 100% VOO
- Keep what I have in VOO but for future paychecks divide the investment money into 70% VOO and 30% VXUS
- Sell my all my VOO shares and buy VTI + VXUS
- Stop buying VOO, keep what I have but start buying VTI + VXUS
- Do any of the past options but for VT
